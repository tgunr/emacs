Some Aquamacs ideas
--------------------------------------------------------
feel free to add your own!

* Include Table mode
  http://table.sourceforge.net/
  for 0.9.8

* Integrate Emacs Code Browser
  http://ecb.sourceforge.net/
  for 1.1
  (make it work with one-buffer-one-frames)


* Map CapsLock reliably to Meta

  - in the works -

* Make ESC work as C-g, i.e. Quit
  This is the normal function of the Escape key.
  Right now it is Meta and we need to find a reliable Meta solution   first (see previous point).

* set enable-recursive-minibuffers to nil.
  This would mean that there needs to be an easier way to quit the minibuffer, i.e. Esc key and maybe some automatic behavior so that started but never completed interactive commands are killed automatically.
For example:
    If we're in an interactive input (call-interactively), then signal a quit automatically before starting the next command.





* A better Buffers menu
DavidReitter: I think it would be a nice thing to structure all the buffers, similar to what msb-mode does. However, msb-mode creates submenus for each category, which is inefficient from a UI point of view - I want all buffers visible in the menu, but separated with divider lines and maybe with a greyed-out title. One could take msb and extend it so that it can do that. Then, move the frame-related stuff out of the File menu and combine it with the Buffers menu, so that we have the equivalent of a normal Windows menu on the Mac. It'd be good if there were functions that 'tile' frames, minimize and zoom them (maybe). But that's lower priority.


* A better Fonts menu (1)
DavidReitter: Someone needs to figure out how to put the Fonts into a proper sub-menu.
--> Wait for Cocoa Emacs.

* A better Fonts menu (3)
DavidReitter: Someone needs to write a Carbon function that brings up the standard OS X font dialog and then takes the user's choice and converts it into a fontset usable by Emacs.
--> Wait for Cocoa Emacs.

* Customization of Mode-specific themes
DavidReitter: Someone knowledgable in customization buffers could figure out how to comfortably customize the aquamacs-mode-specific-default-themes variable.
(Some of this done now)

* Command-modifier character in menus (and everywhere else)
DavidReitter: We map the Command modifier to hyper, which results in it being described as 'H-'. At least in the menus, we want it to be a nice standard Apple-Command sign. Right now this is done by modifying the text of the menu items, which is quite a kludge. Also the keyboard shortcuts in the menus are not properly aligned, which looks ugly and is more difficult to read. Fixing this might be a bit of a challenge, and definitely something for a Carbon/C hacker.
--> Wait for Cocoa Emacs.


* Spell-Check with OS X
DavidReitter: Can someone implement an interface that queries the built-in OS X spellchecker? It would have to implement the ispell/aspell API, which should be too hard. Because such a thing would be small, we could easily distribute it with Aquamacs.
--> Wait for Cocoa Emacs.
