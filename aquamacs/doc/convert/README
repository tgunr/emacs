This directory contains code which converts an HTML Emacs manual into
a set of HTML files usable for Apple Help.

Just run ./make-emacs-manuals.sh

This will call make scripts in the Emacs manual, Emacs Lisp Reference and Misc directories
in order to produce HTML files.

These will then be collected in subfolders under ../
