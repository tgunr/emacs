  <h2 class="chapter">2 Gnus Maintainance Guide</h2>

  <h3 class="section">2.1 Stable and development versions</h3>

  <p>The development of Gnus normally is done on the Git repository
  trunk as of April 19, 2010 (formerly it was done in CVS; the
  repository is at http://git.gnus.org), i.e. there are no separate
  branches to develop and test new features. Most of the time, the
  trunk is developed quite actively with more or less daily
  changes. Only after a new major release, e.g. 5.10.1, there's
  usually a feature period of several months. After the release of
  Gnus 5.10.6 the development of new features started again on the
  trunk while the 5.10 series is continued on the stable branch
  (v5-10) from which more stable releases will be done when needed
  (5.10.8, <small class="dots">...</small>). <a href=
  "../gnus/Gnus-Development.html#Gnus-Development">Gnus
  Development</a></p>

  <p>Stable releases of Gnus finally become part of Emacs. E.g.
  Gnus 5.8 became a part of Emacs 21 (relabeled to Gnus 5.9). The
  5.10 series became part of Emacs 22 as Gnus 5.11.</p>

  <h3 class="section">2.2 Syncing</h3>
  <!-- Some MIDs related to this follow.  Use http://thread.gmane.org/MID -->
  <!-- (and click on the subject) to get the thread on Gmane. -->
  <!-- Some quotes from Miles Bader follow... -->
  <!-- <v9eklyke6b.fsf@marauder.physik.uni-ulm.de> -->
  <!-- <buovfd71nkk.fsf@mctpc71.ucom.lsi.nec.co.jp> -->

  <p>In the past, the inclusion of Gnus into Emacs was quite
  cumbersome. For each change made to Gnus in Emacs repository, it
  had to be checked that it was applied to the new Gnus version,
  too. Else, bug fixes done in Emacs repository might have been
  lost.</p>

  <p>With the inclusion of Gnus 5.10, Miles Bader has set up an
  Emacs-Gnus gateway to ensure the bug fixes from Emacs CVS are
  propagated to Gnus CVS semi-automatically.</p>

  <p>After Emacs moved to bzr and Gnus moved to git, Katsumi
  Yamaoka has taken over the chore of keeping Emacs and Gnus in
  sync. In general, changes made to one repository will usually be
  replicated in the other within a few days.</p>

  <p>Basically the idea is that the gateway will cause all common
  files in Emacs and Gnus v5-13 to be identical except when there's
  a very good reason (e.g., the Gnus version string in Emacs says
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5.11</span></samp>&rsquo;, but
  the v5-13 version string remains &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">5.13.x</span></samp>&rsquo;). Furthermore, all changes in
  these files in either Emacs or the v5-13 branch will be installed
  into the Gnus git trunk, again except where there's a good
  reason.
  <!-- (typically so far the only exception has been that the changes -->
   <!-- already exist in the trunk in modified form). --></p>

  <p>Because of this, when the next major version of Gnus will be
  included in Emacs, it should be very easy &ndash; just plonk in
  the files from the Gnus trunk without worrying about lost changes
  from the Emacs tree.</p>

  <p>The effect of this is that as hacker, you should generally
  only have to make changes in one place:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If it's a file which is thought of as being outside of Gnus
    (e.g., the new <samp><span class=
    "file">encrypt.el</span></samp>), you should probably make the
    change in the Emacs tree, and it will show up in the Gnus tree
    a few days later.

      <p>If you don't have Emacs bzr access (or it's inconvenient),
      you can change such a file in the v5-10 branch, and it should
      propagate to Emacs bzr &ndash; however, it will get some
      extra scrutiny (by Miles) to see if the changes are possibly
      controversial and need discussion on the mailing list. Many
      changes are obvious bug-fixes however, so often there won't
      be any problem.</p>
    </li>

    <li>If it's to a Gnus file, and it's important enough that it
    should be part of Emacs and the v5-10 branch, then you can make
    the change on the v5-10 branch, and it will go into Emacs bzr
    and the Gnus git trunk (a few days later). The most prominent
    examples for such changes are bug-fixed including improvements
    on the documentation.

      <p>If you know that there will be conflicts (perhaps because
      the affected source code is different in v5-10 and the Gnus
      git trunk), then you can install your change in both places,
      and when I try to sync them, there will be a conflict &ndash;
      however, since in most such cases there would be a conflict
      <em>anyway</em>, it's often easier for me to resolve it
      simply if I see two &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">identical</span></samp>&rsquo; changes, and can just
      choose the proper one, rather than having to actually fix the
      code.</p>
    </li>

    <li>For general Gnus development changes, of course you just
    make the change on the Gnus Git trunk and it goes into Emacs a
    few years later... :-)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Of course in any case, if you just can't wait for me to sync
  your change, you can commit it in more than one place and
  probably there will be no problem; usually the changes are
  textually identical anyway, so can be easily resolved
  automatically (sometimes I notice silly things in such multiple
  commits, like whitespace differences, and unify those ;-).
  <!-- I do Emacs->Gnus less often (than Gnus->Emacs) because it tends to -->
   <!-- require more manual work. -->

  <!-- By default I sync about once a week.  I also try to follow any Gnus -->

  <!-- threads on the mailing lists and make sure any changes being discussed -->

  <!-- are kept more up-to-date (so say 1-2 days delay for "topical" changes). -->
   <!-- <buovfd71nkk.fsf@mctpc71.ucom.lsi.nec.co.jp> -->

  <!-- BTW, just to add even more verbose explanation about the syncing thing: --></p>

  <h3 class="section">2.3 Miscellanea</h3>

  <h3 class="heading"><samp><span class=
  "file">GNUS-NEWS</span></samp></h3>

  <p>Starting from No Gnus, the <samp><span class=
  "file">GNUS-NEWS</span></samp> is created from <samp><span class=
  "file">texi/gnus-news.texi</span></samp>. Don't edit
  <samp><span class="file">GNUS-NEWS</span></samp>. Edit
  <samp><span class="file">texi/gnus-news.texi</span></samp>, type
  <samp><span class="command">make GNUS-NEWS</span></samp> in the
  <samp><span class="file">texi</span></samp> directory and commit
  <samp><span class="file">GNUS-NEWS</span></samp> and
  <samp><span class="file">texi/gnus-news.texi</span></samp>.</p>

  <h3 class="heading">Conventions for version information in
  defcustoms</h3>

  <p>For new customizable variables introduced in Oort Gnus
  (including the v5-10 branch) use <code>:version "22.1" ;; Oort
  Gnus</code> (including the comment) or e.g. <code>:version "22.2"
  ;; Gnus 5.10.10</code> if the feature was added for Emacs 22.2
  and Gnus 5.10.10. If the variable is new in No Gnus use
  <code>:version "23.1" ;; No Gnus</code>.</p>

  <p>The same applies for customizable variables when its default
  value was changed. <!-- Local Variables: -->
   <!-- mode: texinfo -->
   <!-- coding: iso-8859-1 -->
   <!-- End: --></p>
