  <h3 class="section">6.1 Reply Buffer Initialization</h3>

  <p>Executing <code>sc-cite-original</code> performs the following
  steps as it initializes the reply buffer:</p>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><a name="index-sc_002dpre_002dhook-146" id=
    "index-sc_002dpre_002dhook-146"></a><a name=
    "index-pre_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-147" id=
    "index-pre_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-147"></a><em>Runs</em>
    <code>sc-pre-hook</code><em>.</em> This hook variable is run
    before <code>sc-cite-original</code> does any other work. You
    could conceivably use this hook to set certain Supercite
    variables based on the reply buffer's mode or name (i.e., to do
    something different based on whether you are replying or
    following up to an article).</li>

    <li>
      <em>Inserts Supercite's keymap.</em> <a name=
      "index-sc_002dmode_002dmap_002dprefix-148" id=
      "index-sc_002dmode_002dmap_002dprefix-148"></a><a name=
      "index-mode_002dmap_002dprefix-_0028sc_002d_0029-149" id=
      "index-mode_002dmap_002dprefix-_0028sc_002d_0029-149"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dp-150"
      id="index-C_002dc-C_002dp-150"></a><a name=
      "index-keymap-prefix-151" id=
      "index-keymap-prefix-151"></a>Supercite provides a number of
      commands for performing post-yank modifications to the reply
      buffer. These commands are installed on Supercite's top-level
      keymap. Since Supercite has to interface with a wide variety
      of MUAs, it does not install all of its commands directly
      into the reply buffer's keymap. Instead, it puts its commands
      on a keymap prefix, then installs this prefix onto the
      buffer's keymap. What this means is that you typically have
      to type more characters to invoke a Supercite command, but
      Supercite's key bindings can be made much more consistent
      across MUAs.

      <p>You can control what key Supercite uses as its keymap
      prefix by changing the variable
      <code>sc-mode-map-prefix</code>. By default, this variable is
      set to <code>C-c C-p</code>; a finger twister perhaps, but
      unfortunately the best default due to the scarcity of
      available key bindings in many MUAs.</p>
    </li>

    <li><em>Turns on Supercite minor mode.</em> <a name=
    "index-modeline-152" id="index-modeline-152"></a>The modeline
    of the reply buffer should indicate that Supercite is active in
    that buffer by displaying the string &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">SC</span></samp>&rsquo;.</li>

    <li><em>Sets the &ldquo;Undo Boundary.&rdquo;</em> <a name=
    "index-undo-boundary-153" id=
    "index-undo-boundary-153"></a>Supercite sets an undo boundary
    before it begins to modify the original yanked text. This
    allows you to easily undo Supercite's changes to affect
    alternative citing styles.</li>

    <li>
      <em>Processes the mail headers.</em> <a name=
      "index-sc_002dconfirm_002dalways_002dp-154" id=
      "index-sc_002dconfirm_002dalways_002dp-154"></a><a name=
      "index-confirm_002dalways_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-155" id=
      "index-confirm_002dalways_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-155"></a><a name="index-sc_002dmail_002dwarn_002dif_002dnon_002drfc822_002dp-156"
      id=
      "index-sc_002dmail_002dwarn_002dif_002dnon_002drfc822_002dp-156"></a><a name="index-mail_002dwarn_002dif_002dnon_002drfc822_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-157"
      id=
      "index-mail_002dwarn_002dif_002dnon_002drfc822_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-157"></a>All
      previously retrieved info key-value pairs are deleted from
      the info alist, then the mail headers in the body of the
      yanked message are scanned. Info key-value pairs are created
      for each header found. Also, such useful information as the
      author's name and email address are extracted. If the
      variable <code>sc-mail-warn-if-non-rfc822-p</code> is
      non-<code>nil</code>, then Supercite will warn you if it
      finds a mail header that does not conform to RFC822. This is
      rare and indicates a problem either with your MUA or the
      original author's MUA, or some MTA (mail transport agent)
      along the way.

      <p><a name="index-sc_002dnuke_002dmail_002dheaders-158" id=
      "index-sc_002dnuke_002dmail_002dheaders-158"></a><a name=
      "index-sc_002dnuke_002dmail_002dheader_002dlist-159" id=
      "index-sc_002dnuke_002dmail_002dheader_002dlist-159"></a><a name="index-nuke_002dmail_002dheaders-_0028sc_002d_0029-160"
      id=
      "index-nuke_002dmail_002dheaders-_0028sc_002d_0029-160"></a><a name="index-nuke_002dmail_002dheader_002dlist-_0028sc_002d_0029-161"
      id=
      "index-nuke_002dmail_002dheader_002dlist-_0028sc_002d_0029-161"></a>Once
      the info keys have been extracted from the mail headers, the
      headers are nuked from the reply buffer. You can control
      exactly which headers are removed or kept, but by default,
      all headers are removed.</p>

      <p>There are two variables which control mail header nuking.
      The variable <code>sc-nuke-mail-headers</code> controls the
      overall behavior of the header nuking routines. By setting
      this variable to <code>'all</code>, you automatically nuke
      all mail headers. Likewise, setting this variable to
      <code>'none</code> inhibits nuking of any mail headers. In
      between these extremes, you can tell Supercite to nuke only a
      specified list of mail headers by setting this variable to
      <code>'specified</code>, or to keep only a specified list of
      headers by setting it to <code>'keep</code>.</p>

      <p>If <code>sc-nuke-mail-headers</code> is set to
      <code>'specified</code> or <code>'keep</code>, then the
      variable <code>sc-nuke-mail-header-list</code> is consulted
      for the list of headers to nuke or keep. This variable
      contains a list of regular expressions. If the mail header
      line matches a regular expression in this list, the header
      will be nuked or kept. The line is matched against the regexp
      using <code>looking-at</code> rooted at the beginning of the
      line.</p>

      <p><a name=
      "index-sc_002dblank_002dlines_002dafter_002dheaders-162" id=
      "index-sc_002dblank_002dlines_002dafter_002dheaders-162"></a><a name="index-blank_002dlines_002dafter_002dheaders-_0028sc_002d_0029-163"
      id=
      "index-blank_002dlines_002dafter_002dheaders-_0028sc_002d_0029-163"></a>If
      the variable <code>sc-blank-lines-after-headers</code> is
      non-<code>nil</code>, it contains the number of blank lines
      remaining in the buffer after mail headers are nuked. By
      default, only one blank line is left in the buffer.</p>
    </li>

    <li><em>Selects the attribution and citation strings.</em> Once
    the mail headers have been processed, Supercite selects a
    attribution string and a citation string which it will use to
    cite the original message. See <a href=
    "Selecting-an-Attribution.html#Selecting-an-Attribution">Selecting
    an Attribution</a>, for details.</li>

    <li>
      <em>Cites the message body.</em> <a name=
      "index-sc_002dcite_002dregion_002dlimit-164" id=
      "index-sc_002dcite_002dregion_002dlimit-164"></a><a name=
      "index-cite_002dregion_002dlimit-_0028sc_002d_0029b-165" id=
      "index-cite_002dregion_002dlimit-_0028sc_002d_0029b-165"></a>After
      the selection of the attribution and citation strings,
      Supercite cites the original message by inserting the
      citation string prefix in front of every uncited line. You
      may not want Supercite to automatically cite very long
      messages however. For example, some email could contain a
      smaller header section followed by a huge uuencoded message.
      It wouldn't make sense to cite the uuencoded message part
      when responding to the original author's short preface. For
      this reason, Supercite provides a variable which limits the
      automatic citation of long messages to a certain maximum
      number of lines. The variable is called
      <code>sc-cite-region-limit</code>. If this variable contains
      an integer, messages with more lines that this will not be
      cited at all, and a warning message will be displayed.
      Supercite has performed everything necessary, though, for you
      to manually cite only the small portion of the original
      message that you want to use.

      <p>If <code>sc-cite-region-limit</code> contains a
      non-<code>nil</code> value, the original message will always
      be cited, regardless of its size. If the variable contains
      the value <code>nil</code>, the region will never be cited
      automatically. Use this if you always want to be able to edit
      and cite the message manually.</p>

      <p><a name="index-sc_002dcite_002dblank_002dlines_002dp-166"
      id=
      "index-sc_002dcite_002dblank_002dlines_002dp-166"></a><a name="index-cite_002dblank_002dlines_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-167"
      id=
      "index-cite_002dblank_002dlines_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-167"></a>The
      variable <code>sc-cite-blank-lines-p</code> controls whether
      blank lines in the original message should be cited or not.
      If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, blank lines will be
      cited just like non-blank lines. Otherwise, blank lines will
      be treated as paragraph separators.</p>

      <p>Citing of the original message is highly configurable.
      Supercite's default setup does a pretty good job of citing
      many common forms of previously cited messages. But there are
      as many citation styles out there as people on the net, or
      just about! It would be impossible for Supercite to
      anticipate every style in existence, and you probably
      wouldn't encounter them all anyway. But you can configure
      Supercite to recognize those styles you see often. See
      <a href=
      "Configuring-the-Citation-Engine.html#Configuring-the-Citation-Engine">
      Configuring the Citation Engine</a>, for details.</p>
    </li>

    <li><em>Runs</em> <code>sc-post-hook</code><em>.</em> <a name=
    "index-sc_002dpost_002dhook-168" id=
    "index-sc_002dpost_002dhook-168"></a><a name=
    "index-post_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-169" id=
    "index-post_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-169"></a>This variable
    is very similar to <code>sc-pre-hook</code>, except that it
    runs after <code>sc-cite-original</code> is finished. This hook
    is provided mostly for completeness and backward compatibility.
    Perhaps it could be used to reset certain variables set in
    <code>sc-pre-hook</code>.</li>
