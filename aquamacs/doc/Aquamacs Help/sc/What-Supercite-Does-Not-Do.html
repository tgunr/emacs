  <h3 class="section">1.2 What Supercite Doesn't Do</h3>

  <p>Because of this clear division of labor, there are useful
  features which are the sole responsibility of the MUA, even
  though it might seem that Supercite should provide them. For
  example, many people would like to be able to yank (and cite)
  only a portion of the original message. Since Supercite only
  modifies the text it finds in the reply buffer as set up by the
  MUA, it is the MUA's responsibility to do partial yanking. See
  <a href=
  "Reply-Buffer-Initialization.html#Reply-Buffer-Initialization">Reply
  Buffer Initialization</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-mail_002dheader_002dseparator-9" id=
  "index-mail_002dheader_002dseparator-9"></a>Another potentially
  useful thing would be for Supercite to set up the outgoing mail
  headers with information it gleans from the reply buffer. But by
  previously agreed upon convention, any text above the
  <code>mail-header-separator</code> which separates mail headers
  from message bodies cannot be modified by Supercite. Supercite,
  in fact, doesn't know anything about the meaning of these
  headers, and never ventures outside the designated region. See
  <a href="Hints-to-MUA-Authors.html#Hints-to-MUA-Authors">Hints to
  MUA Authors</a>, for more details.</p>
