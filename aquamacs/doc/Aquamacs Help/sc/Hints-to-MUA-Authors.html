  <h2 class="chapter">10 Hints to MUA Authors</h2>

  <p>In June of 1989, some discussion was held between the various
  MUA authors, the Supercite author, and other Supercite users.
  These discussions centered around the need for a standard
  interface between MUAs and Supercite (or any future
  Supercite-like packages). This interface was formally proposed by
  Martin Neitzel on Fri, 23 Jun 89, in a mail message to the
  Supercite mailing list:</p>
  <pre class="example">
             Martin&gt; Each news/mail-reader should provide a form of
             Martin&gt; mail-yank-original that

             Martin&gt; 1: inserts the original message incl. header into the
             Martin&gt;    reply buffer; no indentation/prefixing is done, the header
             Martin&gt;    tends to be a "full blown" version rather than to be
             Martin&gt;    stripped down.

             Martin&gt; 2: `point' is at the start of the header, `mark' at the
             Martin&gt;    end of the message body.

             Martin&gt; 3: (run-hooks 'mail-yank-hooks)

             Martin&gt; [Supercite] should be run as such a hook and merely
             Martin&gt; rewrite the message.  This way it isn't anymore
             Martin&gt; [Supercite]'s job to gather the original from obscure
             Martin&gt; sources. [...]
</pre>

  "index-mail_002dyank_002doriginal-274"></a><a name=
  "index-defvar-275" id="index-defvar-275"></a>This specification
  was adopted, but underwent a slight modification with the release
  of Emacs 19. Instead of the variable
  <code>mail-yank-hooks</code>, the hook variable that the MUA
  should provide is <code>mail-citation-hook</code>. Richard
  Stallman suggests that the MUAs should <code>defvar</code>
  <code>mail-citation-hook</code> to <code>nil</code> and perform
  some default citing when that is the case.</p>

  <p>If you are writing a new MUA package, or maintaining an
  existing MUA package, you should make it conform to this
  interface so that your users will be able to link Supercite
  easily and seamlessly. To do this, when setting up a reply or
  forward buffer, your MUA should follow these steps:</p>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>Insert the original message, including the mail headers
    into the reply buffer. At this point you should not modify the
    raw text in any way (except for any necessary decoding, e.g. of
    quoted-printable text), and you should place all the original
    headers into the body of the reply. This means that many of the
    mail headers will be duplicated, one copy above the
    <code>mail-header-separator</code> line and one copy below,
    however there will probably be more headers below this
    line.</li>

    <li>Set &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">point</span></samp>&rsquo; to the beginning of the line
    containing the first mail header in the body of the reply. Set
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mark</span></samp>&rsquo; at
    the end of the message text. It is very important that the
    region be set around the text Supercite is to modify and that
    the mail headers are within this region. Supercite will not
    venture outside the region for any reason, and anything within
    the region is fair game, so don't put anything that
    <strong>must</strong> remain unchanged inside the region.</li>

    <li>Run the hook <code>mail-citation-hook</code>. You will
    probably want to provide some kind of default citation
    functions in cases where the user does not have Supercite
    installed. By default, your MUA should <code>defvar</code>
    <code>mail-citation-hook</code> to <code>nil</code>, and in
    your yanking function, check its value. If it finds
    <code>mail-citation-hook</code> to be <code>nil</code>, it
    should perform some default citing behavior. User who want to
    connect to Supercite then need only add
    <code>sc-cite-original</code> to this list of hooks using
    <code>add-hook</code>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If you do all this your MUA will join the ranks of those that
  conform to this interface &ldquo;out of the box.&rdquo;</p>
