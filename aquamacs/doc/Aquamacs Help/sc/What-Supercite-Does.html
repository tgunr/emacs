  <h3 class="section">1.3 What Supercite Does</h3>

  <p>Supercite is invoked for the first time on a reply buffer via
  your MUA's reply or forward command. This command will actually
  perform citations by calling a hook variable to which Supercite's
  top-level function <code>sc-cite-original</code> has been added.
  When <code>sc-cite-original</code> is executed, the original
  message must be set up in a very specific way, but this is
  handled automatically by the MUA. See <a href=
  "Hints-to-MUA-Authors.html#Hints-to-MUA-Authors">Hints to MUA
  Authors</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-info-alist-11" id="index-info-alist-11"></a>The
  first thing Supercite does, via <code>sc-cite-original</code>, is
  to parse through the original message's mail headers. It saves
  this data in an <dfn>information association list</dfn>, or
  <dfn>info alist</dfn>. The information in this list is used in a
  number of places throughout Supercite. See <a href=
  "Information-Keys-and-the-Info-Alist.html#Information-Keys-and-the-Info-Alist">
  Information Keys and the Info Alist</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-nuking-mail-headers-12" id=
  "index-nuking-mail-headers-12"></a><a name=
  "index-reference-header-13" id=
  "index-reference-header-13"></a>After the mail header info is
  extracted, the headers are optionally removed (<dfn>nuked</dfn>)
  from the reply. Supercite then writes a <dfn>reference
  header</dfn> into the buffer. This reference header is a string
  carrying details about the citation it is about to perform.</p>

  <p><a name="index-modeline-14" id="index-modeline-14"></a>Next,
  Supercite visits each line in the reply, transforming the line
  according to a customizable &ldquo;script.&rdquo; Lines which
  were not previously cited in the original message are given a
  citation, while already cited lines remain untouched, or are
  coerced to your preferred style. Finally, Supercite installs a
  keymap into the reply buffer so that you have access to
  Supercite's post-yank formatting and reciting commands as you
  subsequently edit your reply. You can tell that Supercite has
  been installed into the reply buffer because that buffer's
  modeline will display the minor mode string
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SC</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><a name="index-filladapt-15" id=
  "index-filladapt-15"></a><a name="index-gin_002dmode-16" id=
  "index-gin_002dmode-16"></a><a name="index-fill_002dprefix-17"
  id="index-fill_002dprefix-17"></a><a name=
  "index-fill_002dparagraph-18" id=
  "index-fill_002dparagraph-18"></a>When the original message is
  cited by <code>sc-cite-original</code>, it will (optionally) be
  filled by Supercite. However, if you manually edit the cited text
  and want to re-fill it, you must use an add-on package such as
  <cite>filladapt</cite> or <cite>gin-mode</cite>. These packages
  can recognize Supercited text and will fill them appropriately.
  Emacs' built-in filling routines, e.g.
  <code>fill-paragraph</code>, do not recognize cited text and will
  not re-fill them properly because it cannot guess the
  <code>fill-prefix</code> being used. See <a href=
  "Post_002dyank-Formatting-Commands.html#Post_002dyank-Formatting-Commands">
  Post-yank Formatting Commands</a>, for details.</p>

  <p>As mentioned above, Supercite provides commands to recite or
  uncite regions of text in the reply buffer, and commands to
  perform other beautifications on the cited original text,
  maintaining consistent and informative citations throughout.
  Supercite tries to be as configurable as possible to allow for a
  wide range of personalized citation styles, but it is also
  immediately useful with the default configuration, once it has
  been properly connected to your MUA. See <a href=
  "Getting-Connected.html#Getting-Connected">Getting Connected</a>,
  for more details.</p>
