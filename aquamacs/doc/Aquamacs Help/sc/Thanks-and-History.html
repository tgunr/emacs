  <h2 class="chapter">11 Thanks and History</h2>

  <p>The Supercite package was derived from its predecessor
  Superyank 1.11 which was inspired by various bits of code and
  ideas from Martin Neitzel and Ashwin Ram. They were the folks who
  came up with the idea of non-nested citations and implemented
  some rough code to provide this style. Superyank and Supercite
  version 2 evolved to the point where much of the attribution
  selection mechanism was automatic, and features have been
  continuously added through the comments and suggestions of the
  Supercite mailing list participants.</p>

  <p>With version 3, Supercite underwent an almost complete
  rewrite, benefitting in a number of ways, including vast
  improvements in the speed of performance, a big reduction in size
  of the code and in the use of Emacs resources, and a much cleaner
  and flexible internal architecture. Most of this work was
  internal and not of very great importance to the casual user.
  There were some changes at the user-visible level, but for the
  most part, the Supercite configuration variables from version 2
  should still be relevant to version 3. Hopefully Supercite
  version 3 is faster, smaller, and much more flexible than its
  predecessors.</p>

  <p>In the version 2 manual I thanked some specific people for
  their help in developing Supercite 2. You folks know who you are
  and your continued support is greatly appreciated. I wish to
  thank everyone on the Supercite mailing list, especially the
  brave alpha testers, who helped considerably in testing out the
  concepts and implementation of Supercite version 3. Special
  thanks go out to the MUA and Emacs authors Kyle Jones, Stephen
  Gildea, Richard Stallman, and Jamie Zawinski for coming to a
  quick agreement on the new <code>mail-citation-hook</code>
  interface, and for adding the magic lisp to their code to support
  this.</p>

  <p>All who have helped and contributed have been greatly
  appreciated.</p>
