  necessary to begin using Supercite is to add the following to
  <samp><span class="file">~.emacs</span></samp>:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (add-hook 'mail-citation-hook 'sc-cite-original)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">For more details of the process, read
  on<small class="dots">...</small></p>

  <p>Hitting <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd> in your MUA's reply buffer yanks
  and cites the original message into the reply buffer. In reality,
  the citation of the original message is performed via a call
  through a configurable hook variable. The name of this variable
  has been agreed to in advance as part of the <dfn>citation
  interface specification</dfn>. By default this hook variable has
  a <code>nil</code> value, which the MUA recognizes to mean,
  &ldquo;use your default citation function.&rdquo; When you add
  Supercite's citation function to the hook, thereby giving the
  variable a non-<code>nil</code> value, it tells the MUA to run
  the hook via <code>run-hooks</code> instead of using the default
  citation.</p>

  <p>Early in Supercite's development, the Supercite author, a few
  MUA authors, and some early Supercite users got together and
  agreed upon a standard interface between MUAs and citation
  packages (of which Supercite is currently the only known add-on
  <tt>:-)</tt>. Supercite can probably be used with most Emacs
  MUAs, with a greater or lesser degree of effort.</p>

  <p>To learn exactly how to connect Supercite to the software
  systems you are using, read the appropriate following sections.
  For details on the interface specifications, or if you are
  writing or maintaining an MUA, see <a href=
  "Hints-to-MUA-Authors.html#Hints-to-MUA-Authors">Hints to MUA
  Authors</a>.</p>

  "index-submit_002dbug_002dreport-_0028sc_002d_0029-137"></a>The
  first thing that everyone should do, regardless of the MUA you
  are using is to set up Emacs so it will load Supercite at the
  appropriate time. This happens automatically if Supercite is
  distributed with your Emacs version. If not, you can set up an
  <dfn>autoload</dfn> for Supercite.</p>

  <p>To do the latter, put the following in your <samp><span class=
  "file">.emacs</span></samp> file:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (autoload 'sc-cite-original "supercite" nil t)
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-point-138" id="index-point-138"></a><a name=
  "index-mark-139" id="index-mark-139"></a>The function
  <code>sc-cite-original</code> is the top-level Supercite function
  designed to be run from the citation hook. It expects
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">point</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mark</span></samp>&rsquo; to be
  set around the region to cite, and it expects the original
  article's mail headers to be present within this region. Note
  that Supercite <em>never</em> touches any text outside this
  region. Note further that the region need not be active for
  <code>sc-cite-original</code> to do its job. See <a href=
  "Hints-to-MUA-Authors.html#Hints-to-MUA-Authors">Hints to MUA
  Authors</a>.</p>

  <p>The other step in the getting connected process is to make
  sure your MUA calls <code>sc-cite-original</code> at the right
  time. As mentioned above, some MUAs handle this differently. Read
  the sections that follow pertaining to the MUAs you are
  using.</p>

  <p><a name="index-sc_002dload_002dhook-140" id=
  "index-sc_002dload_002dhook-140"></a><a name=
  "index-load_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-141" id=
  "index-load_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-141"></a><a name=
  "index-sc_002dpre_002dhook-142" id=
  "index-sc_002dpre_002dhook-142"></a><a name=
  "index-pre_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-143" id=
  "index-pre_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-143"></a>One final note.
  After Supercite is loaded into your Emacs session, it runs the
  hook <code>sc-load-hook</code>. You can put any customizations
  into this hook since it is only run once. This will not work,
  however, if your Emacs maintainer has put Supercite into your
  dumped Emacs' image. In that case, you can use the
  <code>sc-pre-hook</code> variable, but this will get executed
  every time <code>sc-cite-original</code> is called. See <a href=
  "Reply-Buffer-Initialization.html#Reply-Buffer-Initialization">Reply
  Buffer Initialization</a>.</p>
