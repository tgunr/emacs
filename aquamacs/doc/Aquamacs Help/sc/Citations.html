  <h2 class="chapter">2 Citations</h2>

  <p>A <dfn>citation</dfn> is the acknowledgement of the original
  author of a mail message in the body of the reply. There are two
  basic citation styles which Supercite supports. The first, called
  <dfn>nested citations</dfn> is an anonymous form of citation; in
  other words, an indication is made that the cited line was
  written by someone <em>other</em> that the current message author
  (i.e., other than you, the person composing the reply), but no
  reference is made as to the identity of the original author. This
  style should look familiar since its use on the net is
  widespread. Here's an example of what a message buffer would look
  like using nested citations after multiple replies:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     &gt;&gt; John originally wrote this
     &gt;&gt; and this as well
     &gt; Jane said that John didn't know
     &gt; what he was talking about
     And that's what I think too.
</pre>

  <p>Note that multiple inclusions of the original messages result
  in a nesting of the &lsquo;<samp><code>&gt;</code></samp>&rsquo;
  characters. This can sometimes be quite confusing when many
  levels of citations are included since it may be difficult or
  impossible to figure out who actually participated in the thread,
  and multiple nesting of
  &lsquo;<samp><code>&gt;</code></samp>&rsquo; characters can
  sometimes make the message very difficult for the eye to
  scan.</p>

  <p><a name="index-non_002dnested-citations-21" id=
  "index-non_002dnested-citations-21"></a>In <dfn>non-nested
  citations</dfn>, each cited line begins with an informative
  string attributing that line to the original author. Only the
  first level of attribution will be shown; subsequent citations
  don't nest the citation strings. The above dialog might look like
  this when non-nested citations are used:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     John&gt; John originally wrote this
     John&gt; and this as well
     Jane&gt; Jane said that John didn't know
     Jane&gt; what he was talking about
     And that's what I think too.
</pre>

  <p>Notice here that my inclusion of Jane's inclusion of John's
  original message did not result in a line cited with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Jane&gt;John&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><a name="index-sc_002dnested_002dcitation_002dp-22" id=
  "index-sc_002dnested_002dcitation_002dp-22"></a><a name=
  "index-nested_002dcitation_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-23" id=
  "index-nested_002dcitation_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-23"></a>Supercite
  supports both styles of citation, and the variable
  <code>sc-nested-citation-p</code> controls which style it will
  use when citing previously uncited text. When this variable is
  <code>nil</code> (the default), non-nested citations are used.
  When non-<code>nil</code>, nested citations are used.</p>
