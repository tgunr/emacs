  <h3 class="section">1.1 Summary</h3>

  <p><a name="index-summary-2" id="index-summary-2"></a> Org is a
  mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing project
  planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.</p>

  <p>Org develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that
  contain lists or information about projects as plain text. Org is
  implemented on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to
  keep the content of large files well structured. Visibility
  cycling and structure editing help to work with the tree. Tables
  are easily created with a built-in table editor. Org supports
  TODO items, deadlines, timestamps, and scheduling. It dynamically
  compiles entries into an agenda that utilizes and smoothly
  integrates much of the Emacs calendar and diary. Plain text
  URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet messages, BBDB
  entries, and any files related to the projects. For printing and
  sharing of notes, an Org file can be exported as a structured
  ASCII file, as HTML, or (TODO and agenda items only) as an
  iCalendar file. It can also serve as a publishing tool for a set
  of linked web pages.</p>

  <p>As a project planning environment, Org works by adding
  metadata to outline nodes. Based on this data, specific entries
  can be extracted in queries and create dynamic <i>agenda
  views</i>.</p>

  <p>Org mode contains the Org Babel environment which allows you
  to work with embedded source code blocks in a file, to facilitate
  code evaluation, documentation, and tangling.</p>

  <p>Org's automatic, context-sensitive table editor with
  spreadsheet capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by
  activating the minor Orgtbl mode. Using a translation step, it
  can be used to maintain tables in arbitrary file types, for
  example in LaTeX. The structure editing and list creation
  capabilities can be used outside Org with the minor Orgstruct
  mode.</p>

  <p>Org keeps simple things simple. When first fired up, it should
  feel like a straightforward, easy to use outliner. Complexity is
  not imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available
  when you need it. Org is a toolbox and can be used in different
  ways and for different ends, for example:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     <span class=
"roman">&bull; an outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing</span>
     <span class=
"roman">&bull; an ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes</span>
     <span class="roman">&bull; a TODO list editor</span>
     <span class=
"roman">&bull; a full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling</span>
     <a name="index-GTD_002c-Getting-Things-Done-3" id=
"index-GTD_002c-Getting-Things-Done-3"></a><span class=
"roman">&bull; an environment in which to implement David Allen's GTD system</span>
     <span class=
"roman">&bull; a simple hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export</span>
     <span class=
"roman">&bull; a publishing tool to create a set of interlinked webpages</span>
     <span class=

  well as additional information, frequently asked questions (FAQ),
  links to tutorials, etc. This page is located at <a href=
