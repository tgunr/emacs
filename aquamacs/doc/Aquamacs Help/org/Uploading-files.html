  <p><a name="index-rsync-1676" id="index-rsync-1676"></a><a name=
  "index-unison-1677" id="index-unison-1677"></a> For those people
  already utilizing third party sync tools such as
  <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp> or
  <samp><span class="command">unison</span></samp>, it might be
  preferable not to use the built in <i>remote</i> publishing
  facilities of Org-mode which rely heavily on Tramp. Tramp, while
  very useful and powerful, tends not to be so efficient for
  multiple file transfer and has been known to cause problems under
  heavy usage.</p>

  <p>Specialized synchronization utilities offer several
  advantages. In addition to timestamp comparison, they also do
  content and permissions/attribute checks. For this reason you
  might prefer to publish your web to a local directory (possibly
  even <i>in place</i> with your Org files) and then use
  <samp><span class="file">unison</span></samp> or
  <samp><span class="file">rsync</span></samp> to do the
  synchronization with the remote host.</p>

  <p>Since Unison (for example) can be configured as to which files
  to transfer to a certain remote destination, it can greatly
  simplify the project publishing definition. Simply keep all files
  in the correct location, process your Org files with
  <code>org-publish</code> and let the synchronization tool do the
  rest. You do not need, in this scenario, to include attachments
  such as <samp><span class="file">jpg</span></samp>,
  <samp><span class="file">css</span></samp> or <samp><span class=
  "file">gif</span></samp> files in the project definition since
  the 3rd party tool syncs them.</p>

  <p>Publishing to a local directory is also much faster than to a
  remote one, so that you can afford more easily to republish
  entire projects. If you set
  <code>org-publish-use-timestamps-flag</code> to <code>nil</code>,
  you gain the main benefit of re-including any changed external
  files such as source example files you might include with
  <code>#+INCLUDE</code>. The timestamp mechanism in Org is not
  smart enough to detect if included files have been modified.</p>
