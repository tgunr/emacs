  <h3 class="section">8.3 Deadlines and scheduling</h3>

  <p>A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate
  planning:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><var>DEADLINE</var></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-DEADLINE-keyword-791" id=
      "index-DEADLINE-keyword-791"></a> Meaning: the task (most
      likely a TODO item, though not necessarily) is supposed to be
      finished on that date.

      <p><a name="index-org_002ddeadline_002dwarning_002ddays-792"
      id="index-org_002ddeadline_002dwarning_002ddays-792"></a>On
      the deadline date, the task will be listed in the agenda. In
      addition, the agenda for <em>today</em> will carry a warning
      about the approaching or missed deadline, starting
      <code>org-deadline-warning-days</code> before the due date,
      and continuing until the entry is marked DONE. An
      example:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          *** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
              The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]
              DEADLINE: &lt;2004-02-29 Sun&gt;
</pre>

      <p>You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a
      specific deadlines using the following syntax. Here is an
      example with a warning period of 5 days <code>DEADLINE:
      &lt;2004-02-29 Sun -5d&gt;</code>.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><var>SCHEDULED</var></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-SCHEDULED-keyword-793" id=
      "index-SCHEDULED-keyword-793"></a> Meaning: you are planning
      to start working on that task on the given date.

      <p><a name=
      "index-org_002dagenda_002dskip_002dscheduled_002dif_002ddone-794"
      id=
      "index-org_002dagenda_002dskip_002dscheduled_002dif_002ddone-794">
      </a>The headline will be listed under the given date<a rel=
      "footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id=
      "fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In addition, a reminder that the
      scheduled date has passed will be present in the compilation
      for <em>today</em>, until the entry is marked DONE, i.e. the
      task will automatically be forwarded until completed.</p>
      <pre class="example">
          *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
              SCHEDULED: &lt;2004-12-25 Sat&gt;
</pre>

      <p class="noindent"><b>Important:</b> Scheduling an item in
      Org-mode should <i>not</i> be understood in the same way that
      we understand <i>scheduling a meeting</i>. Setting a date for
      a meeting is just a simple appointment, you should mark this
      entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown
      on the date where it applies. This is a frequent
      misunderstanding by Org users. In Org-mode, <i>scheduling</i>
      means setting a date when you want to start working on an
      action item.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>You may use timestamps with repeaters in scheduling and
  deadline entries. Org-mode will issue early and late warnings
  based on the assumption that the timestamp represents the
  <i>nearest instance</i> of the repeater. However, the use of
  diary sexp entries like <code>&lt;%%(diary-float t 42)&gt;</code>
  in scheduling and deadline timestamps is limited. Org-mode does
  not know enough about the internals of each sexp function to
  issue early and late warnings. However, it will show the item on
  each day where the sexp entry matches.</p>
