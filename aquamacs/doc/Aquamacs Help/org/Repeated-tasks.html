  <h4 class="subsection">8.3.2 Repeated tasks</h4>

  <p><a name="index-tasks_002c-repeated-811" id=
  "index-tasks_002c-repeated-811"></a><a name=
  "index-repeated-tasks-812" id="index-repeated-tasks-812"></a>
  Some tasks need to be repeated again and again. Org-mode helps to
  organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a DEADLINE,
  SCHEDULED, or plain timestamp. In the following example</p>
  <pre class="example">
     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: &lt;2005-10-01 Sat +1m&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">the <code>+1m</code> is a repeater; the
  intended interpretation is that the task has a deadline on
  &lt;2005-10-01&gt; and repeats itself every (one) month starting
  from that time. If you need both a repeater and a special warning
  period in a deadline entry, the repeater should come first and
  the warning period last: <code>DEADLINE: &lt;2005-10-01 Sat +1m
  -3d&gt;</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-org_002dtodo_002drepeat_002dto_002dstate-813"
  id=
  "index-org_002dtodo_002drepeat_002dto_002dstate-813"></a>Deadlines
  and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they are
  over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as
  completed once you have done so. When you mark a DEADLINE or a
  SCHEDULE with the TODO keyword DONE, it will no longer produce
  entries in the agenda. The problem with this is, however, that
  then also the <em>next</em> instance of the repeated entry will
  not be active. Org-mode deals with this in the following way:
  When you try to mark such an entry DONE (using <kbd>C-c
  C-t</kbd>), it will shift the base date of the repeating
  timestamp by the repeater interval, and immediately set the entry
  state back to TODO<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id=
  "fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In the example above, setting the state
  to DONE would actually switch the date like this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: &lt;2005-11-01 Tue +1m&gt;
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-org_002dlog_002drepeat-814" id=
  "index-org_002dlog_002drepeat-814"></a>A timestamp<a rel=
  "footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2" id="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
  will be added under the deadline, to keep a record that you
  actually acted on the previous instance of this deadline.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry will no
  longer be visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all
  future instances will be visible.</p>

  <p>With the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+1m</span></samp>&rsquo; cookie, the date shift will
  always be exactly one month. So if you have not paid the rent for
  three months, marking this entry DONE will still keep it as an
  overdue deadline. Depending on the task, this may not be the best
  way to handle it. For example, if you forgot to call your father
  for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call him 3 times in a
  single day to make up for it. Finally, there are tasks like
  changing batteries which should always repeat a certain time
  <i>after</i> the last time you did it. For these tasks, Org-mode
  has special repeaters &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">++</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">.+</span></samp>&rsquo;. For example:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     ** TODO Call Father
        DEADLINE: &lt;2008-02-10 Sun ++1w&gt;
        Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one week,
        but also by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
        the future.  However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called
        and marked it done on Saturday.
     ** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
        DEADLINE: &lt;2005-11-01 Tue .+1m&gt;
        Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after
        today.
</pre>

  <p>You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a
  specific task&mdash;just make sure that the repeater intervals on
  both are the same.</p>

  <p>An alternative to using a repeater is to create a number of
  copies of a task subtree, with dates shifted in each copy. The
  command <kbd>C-c C-x c</kbd> was created for this purpose, it is
  described in <a href=
  "Structure-editing.html#Structure-editing">Structure
  editing</a>.</p>

    <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1" id=
    "fn-1">1</a>]</small> In fact, the target state is taken from,
    in this sequence, the <code>REPEAT_TO_STATE</code> property or
    the variable <code>org-todo-repeat-to-state</code>. If neither
    of these is specified, the target state defaults to the first
    state of the TODO state sequence.</p>

    <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2" id=
    "fn-2">2</a>]</small> You can change this using the option
    <code>org-log-repeat</code>, or the <code>#+STARTUP</code>
    options <code>logrepeat</code>, <code>lognoterepeat</code>, and
    <code>nologrepeat</code>. With <code>lognoterepeat</code>, you
    will also be prompted for a note.</p>
