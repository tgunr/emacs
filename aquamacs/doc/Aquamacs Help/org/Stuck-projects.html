  <h4 class="subsection">10.3.6 Stuck projects</h4>

  <p>If you are following a system like David Allen's GTD to
  organize your work, one of the &ldquo;duties&rdquo; you have is a
  regular review to make sure that all projects move along. A
  <em>stuck</em> project is a project that has no defined next
  actions, so it will never show up in the TODO lists Org-mode
  produces. During the review, you need to identify such projects
  and define next actions for them. <a name=
  "index-C_002dc-a-_0023-1062" id="index-C_002dc-a-_0023-1062"></a>
  <a name=
  "index-org_002dagenda_002dlist_002dstuck_002dprojects-1063" id=
  "index-org_002dagenda_002dlist_002dstuck_002dprojects-1063"></a></p>

  <dl>
    <dt><kbd>C-c a #
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(</kbd><code>org-agenda-list-stuck-projects</code><kbd>)</kbd></dt>

    <dd>List projects that are stuck. <a name=
    "index-C_002dc-a-_0021-1064" id=
    "index-C_002dc-a-_0021-1064"></a><br /></dd>

    <dt><kbd>C-c a !</kbd></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-org_002dstuck_002dprojects-1065" id=
    "index-org_002dstuck_002dprojects-1065"></a>Customize the
    variable <code>org-stuck-projects</code> to define what a stuck
    project is and how to find it.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>You almost certainly will have to configure this view before
  it will work for you. The built-in default assumes that all your
  projects are level-2 headlines, and that a project is not stuck
  if it has at least one entry marked with a TODO keyword TODO or
  NEXT or NEXTACTION.</p>

  <p>Let's assume that you, in your own way of using Org-mode,
  identify projects with a tag PROJECT, and that you use a TODO
  keyword MAYBE to indicate a project that should not be considered
  yet. Let's further assume that the TODO keyword DONE marks
  finished projects, and that NEXT and TODO indicate next actions.
  The tag @SHOP indicates shopping and is a next action even
  without the NEXT tag. Finally, if the project contains the
  special word IGNORE anywhere, it should not be listed either. In
  this case you would start by identifying eligible projects with a
  tags/todo match<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id=
  "fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE</span></samp>&rsquo;, and then check
  for TODO, NEXT, @SHOP, and IGNORE in the subtree to identify
  projects that are not stuck. The correct customization for this
  is</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq org-stuck-projects
           '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("NEXT" "TODO") ("@SHOP")
                                    "\\&lt;IGNORE\\&gt;"))
</pre>

  <p>Note that if a project is identified as non-stuck, the subtree
  of this entry will still be searched for stuck projects.</p>
