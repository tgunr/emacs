  <h4 class="subsection">8.4.3 Resolving idle time</h4>

  <p><a name="index-resolve-idle-time-855" id=
  "index-resolve-idle-time-855"></a> <a name=
  "index-idle_002c-resolve_002c-dangling-856" id=
  "index-idle_002c-resolve_002c-dangling-856"></a>If you clock in
  on a work item, and then walk away from your
  computer&mdash;perhaps to take a phone call&mdash;you often need
  to &ldquo;resolve&rdquo; the time you were away by either
  subtracting it from the current clock, or applying it to another
  one.</p>

  <p><a name="index-org_002dclock_002didle_002dtime-857" id=
  "index-org_002dclock_002didle_002dtime-857"></a>By customizing
  the variable <code>org-clock-idle-time</code> to some integer,
  such as 10 or 15, Emacs can alert you when you get back to your
  computer after being idle for that many minutes<a rel="footnote"
  href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and ask
  what you want to do with the idle time. There will be a question
  waiting for you when you get back, indicating how much idle time
  has passed (constantly updated with the current amount), as well
  as a set of choices to correct the discrepancy:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><kbd>k</kbd></dt>

    <dd>To keep some or all of the minutes and stay clocked in,
    press <kbd>k</kbd>. Org will ask how many of the minutes to
    keep. Press &lt;RET&gt; to keep them all, effectively changing
    nothing, or enter a number to keep that many
    minutes.<br /></dd>

    <dt><kbd>K</kbd></dt>

    <dd>If you use the shift key and press <kbd>K</kbd>, it will
    keep however many minutes you request and then immediately
    clock out of that task. If you keep all of the minutes, this is
    the same as just clocking out of the current task.<br /></dd>

    <dt><kbd>s</kbd></dt>

    <dd>To keep none of the minutes, use <kbd>s</kbd> to subtract
    all the away time from the clock, and then check back in from
    the moment you returned.<br /></dd>

    <dt><kbd>S</kbd></dt>

    <dd>To keep none of the minutes and just clock out at the start
    of the away time, use the shift key and press <kbd>S</kbd>.
    Remember that using shift will always leave you clocked out, no
    matter which option you choose.<br /></dd>

    <dt><kbd>C</kbd></dt>

    <dd>To cancel the clock altogether, use <kbd>C</kbd>. Note that
    if instead of canceling you subtract the away time, and the
    resulting clock amount is less than a minute, the clock will
    still be canceled rather than clutter up the log with an empty
    entry.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>What if you subtracted those away minutes from the current
  clock, and now want to apply them to a new clock? Simply clock in
  to any task immediately after the subtraction. Org will notice
  that you have subtracted time &ldquo;on the books&rdquo;, so to
  speak, and will ask if you want to apply those minutes to the
  next task you clock in on.</p>

  <p>There is one other instance when this clock resolution magic
  occurs. Say you were clocked in and hacking away, and suddenly
  your cat chased a mouse who scared a hamster that crashed into
  your UPS's power button! You suddenly lose all your buffers, but
  thanks to auto-save you still have your recent Org mode changes,
  including your last clock in.</p>

  <p>If you restart Emacs and clock into any task, Org will notice
  that you have a dangling clock which was never clocked out from
  your last session. Using that clock's starting time as the
  beginning of the unaccounted-for period, Org will ask how you
  want to resolve that time. The logic and behavior is identical to
  dealing with away time due to idleness; it's just happening due
  to a recovery event rather than a set amount of idle time.</p>

  <p>You can also check all the files visited by your Org agenda
  for dangling clocks at any time using <kbd>M-x
  org-resolve-clocks</kbd>.</p>

    <h4>Footnotes</h4>

    <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1" id=
    "fn-1">1</a>]</small> On computers using Mac OS X, idleness is
    based on actual user idleness, not just Emacs' idle time. For
    X11, you can install a utility program <samp><span class=
    "file">x11idle.c</span></samp>, available in the UTILITIES
    directory of the Org git distribution, to get the same general
    treatment of idleness. On other systems, idle time refers to
    Emacs idle time only.</p>
