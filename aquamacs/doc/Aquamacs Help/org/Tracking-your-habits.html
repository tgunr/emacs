  <h4 class="subsection">5.3.3 Tracking your habits</h4>

  <p><a name="index-habits-543" id="index-habits-543"></a> Org has
  the ability to track the consistency of a special category of
  TODOs, called &ldquo;habits&rdquo;. A habit has the following
  properties:</p>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>You have enabled the <code>habits</code> module by
    customizing the variable <code>org-modules</code>.</li>

    <li>The habit is a TODO, with a TODO keyword representing an
    open state.</li>

    <li>The property <code>STYLE</code> is set to the value
    <code>habit</code>.</li>

    <li>The TODO has a scheduled date, usually with a
    <code>.+</code> style repeat interval. A <code>++</code> style
    may be appropriate for habits with time constraints, e.g., must
    be done on weekends, or a <code>+</code> style for an unusual
    habit that can have a backlog, e.g., weekly reports.</li>

    <li>The TODO may also have minimum and maximum ranges specified
    by using the syntax &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">.+2d/3d</span></samp>&rsquo;, which says that you want
    to do the task at least every three days, but at most every two
    days.</li>

    <li>You must also have state logging for the <code>DONE</code>
    state enabled, in order for historical data to be represented
    in the consistency graph. If it's not enabled it's not an
    error, but the consistency graphs will be largely
    meaningless.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To give you an idea of what the above rules look like in
  action, here's an actual habit with some history:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     ** TODO Shave
        SCHEDULED: &lt;2009-10-17 Sat .+2d/4d&gt;
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-15 Thu]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-12 Mon]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-10 Sat]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-04 Sun]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-02 Fri]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-29 Tue]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-25 Fri]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-19 Sat]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-16 Wed]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-12 Sat]
        :PROPERTIES:
        :STYLE:    habit
        :LAST_REPEAT: [2009-10-19 Mon 00:36]
        :END:
</pre>

  <p>What this habit says is: I want to shave at most every 2 days
  (given by the <code>SCHEDULED</code> date and repeat interval)
  and at least every 4 days. If today is the 15th, then the habit
  first appears in the agenda on Oct 17, after the minimum of 2
  days has elapsed, and will appear overdue on Oct 19, after four
  days have elapsed.</p>

  <p>What's really useful about habits is that they are displayed
  along with a consistency graph, to show how consistent you've
  been at getting that task done in the past. This graph shows
  every day that the task was done over the past three weeks, with
  colors for each day. The colors used are:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>Blue</code></dt>

    <dd>If the task wasn't to be done yet on that day.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>Green</code></dt>

    <dd>If the task could have been done on that day.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>Yellow</code></dt>

    <dd>If the task was going to be overdue the next
    day.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>Red</code></dt>

    <dd>If the task was overdue on that day.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>In addition to coloring each day, the day is also marked with
  an asterisk if the task was actually done that day, and an
  exclamation mark to show where the current day falls in the
  graph.</p>

  <p>There are several configuration variables that can be used to
  change the way habits are displayed in the agenda.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>org-habit-graph-column</code></dt>

    <dd>The buffer column at which the consistency graph should be
    drawn. This will overwrite any text in that column, so it's a
    good idea to keep your habits' titles brief and to the
    point.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>org-habit-preceding-days</code></dt>

    <dd>The amount of history, in days before today, to appear in
    consistency graphs.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>org-habit-following-days</code></dt>

    <dd>The number of days after today that will appear in
    consistency graphs.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today</code></dt>

    <dd>If non-nil, only show habits in today's agenda view. This
    is set to true by default.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Lastly, pressing <kbd>K</kbd> in the agenda buffer will cause
  habits to temporarily be disabled and they won't appear at all.
  Press <kbd>K</kbd> again to bring them back. They are also
  subject to tag filtering, if you have habits which should only be
  done in certain contexts, for example.</p>
