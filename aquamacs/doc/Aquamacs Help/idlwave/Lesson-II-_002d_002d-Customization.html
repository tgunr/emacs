  <h3 class="section">3.2 Lesson II: Customization</h3>

  <p>Emacs is probably the most customizable piece of software ever
  written, and it would be a shame if you did not make use of this
  to adapt IDLWAVE to your own preferences. Customizing Emacs or
  IDLWAVE is accomplished by setting Lisp variables in the
  <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file in your home
  directory &mdash; but do not be dismayed; for the most part, you
  can just copy and work from the examples given here.</p>

  <p>Let's first use a boolean variable. These are variables which
  you turn on or off, much like a checkbox. A value of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo; means on,
  a value of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">nil</span></samp>&rsquo; means off. Copy the following
  line into your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
  file, exit and restart Emacs.</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq idlwave-reserved-word-upcase t)
</pre>

  <p>When this option is turned on, each reserved word you type
  into an IDL source buffer will be converted to upper case when
  you press &lt;SPC&gt; or &lt;RET&gt; right after the word. Try it
  out! &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">if</span></samp>&rsquo;
  changes to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">IF</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">begin</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">BEGIN</span></samp>&rsquo;. If you don't like this
  behavior, remove the option again from your <samp><span class=
  "file">.emacs</span></samp> file and restart Emacs.</p>

  <p>You likely have your own indentation preferences for IDL code.
  For example, some may prefer to indent the main block of an IDL
  program slightly from the margin and use only 3 spaces as
  indentation between <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code>. Try
  the following lines in <samp><span class=
  "file">.emacs</span></samp>:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq idlwave-main-block-indent 1)
     (setq idlwave-block-indent 3)
     (setq idlwave-end-offset -3)
</pre>

  <p>Restart Emacs, and re-indent the program we developed in the
  first part of this tutorial with <kbd>C-c h</kbd> and
  <kbd>C-M-\</kbd>. You may want to keep these lines in
  <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>, with values
  adjusted to your likings. If you want to get more information
  about any of these variables, type, e.g., <kbd>C-h v
  idlwave-main-block-indent &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. To find which
  variables can be customized, look for items marked
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">User Option:</span></samp>&rsquo;
  throughout this manual.</p>

  <p>If you cannot seem to master this Lisp customization in
  <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>, there is another,
  more user-friendly way to customize all the IDLWAVE variables.
  You can access it through the IDLWAVE menu in one of the
  <samp><span class="file">.pro</span></samp> buffers, menu item
  <code>Customize-&gt;Browse IDLWAVE Group</code>. Here you'll be
  presented with all the various variables grouped into categories.
  You can navigate the hierarchy (e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">IDLWAVE Code Formatting-&gt;Idlwave Abbrev And Indent
  Action-&gt;Idlwave Expand Generic End</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  turn on <code>END</code> expansion), read about the variables,
  change them, and `Save for Future Sessions'. Few of these
  variables need customization, but you can exercise considerable
  control over IDLWAVE's functionality with them.</p>

  <p>You may also find the key bindings used for the debugging
  commands too long and complicated. Often we have heard complaints
  along the lines of, &ldquo;Do I really have to go through the
  finger gymnastics of <kbd>C-c C-d C-c</kbd> to run a simple
  command?&rdquo; Due to Emacs rules and conventions, shorter
  bindings cannot be set by default, but you can easily enable
  them. First, there is a way to assign all debugging commands in a
  single sweep to another simpler combination. The only problem is
  that we have to use something which Emacs does not need for other
  important commands. One good option is to execute debugging
  commands by holding down &lt;CONTROL&gt; and &lt;SHIFT&gt; while
  pressing a single character: <kbd>C-S-b</kbd> for setting a
  breakpoint, <kbd>C-S-c</kbd> for compiling the current source
  file, <kbd>C-S-a</kbd> for deleting all breakpoints (try it, it's
  easier). You can enable this with:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(shift control))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">If you have a special keyboard with, for
  example, a &lt;SUPER&gt; key, you could even shorten that:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(super))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">to get compilation on <kbd>S-c</kbd>. Often,
  a modifier key like &lt;SUPER&gt; or &lt;HYPER&gt; is bound or
  can be bound to an otherwise unused key on your keyboard &mdash;
  consult your system documentation.</p>

  <p>You can also assign specific commands to keys. This you must
  do in the <em>mode-hook</em>, a special function which is run
  when a new IDLWAVE buffer gets set up. The possibilities for key
  customization are endless. Here we set function keys f4-f8 to
  common debugging commands.</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     ;; First for the source buffer
     (add-hook 'idlwave-mode-hook
        (lambda ()
         (local-set-key [f4] 'idlwave-shell-retall)
         (local-set-key [f5] 'idlwave-shell-break-here)
         (local-set-key [f6] 'idlwave-shell-clear-current-bp)
         (local-set-key [f7] 'idlwave-shell-cont)
         (local-set-key [f8] 'idlwave-shell-clear-all-bp)))
     ;; Then for the shell buffer
     (add-hook 'idlwave-shell-mode-hook
        (lambda ()
         (local-set-key [f4] 'idlwave-shell-retall)
         (local-set-key [f5] 'idlwave-shell-break-here)
         (local-set-key [f6] 'idlwave-shell-clear-current-bp)
         (local-set-key [f7] 'idlwave-shell-cont)
         (local-set-key [f8] 'idlwave-shell-clear-all-bp)))
