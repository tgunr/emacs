  <h3 class="section">5.6 Custom Expression Examination</h3>

  <p><a name="index-Expressions_002c-custom-examination-333" id=
  "index-Expressions_002c-custom-examination-333"></a><a name=
  "index-Custom-expression-examination-334" id=
  "index-Custom-expression-examination-334"></a> The variety of
  possible variable and expression examination commands is endless
  (just look, for instance, at the keyword list to
  <code>widget_info()</code>). Rather than attempt to include them
  all, IDLWAVE provides two easy methods to customize your own
  commands, with a special mouse examine command, and two macros
  for generating your own examine key and mouse bindings.</p>

  <p>The most powerful and flexible mouse examine command of all is
  available on <kbd>C-S-Mouse-2</kbd>. Just as for all the other
  mouse examine commands, it permits click or drag expression
  selection, but instead of sending hard-coded commands to the
  shell, it pops-up a customizable selection list of examine
  functions to choose among, configured with the
  <code>idlwave-shell-examine-alist</code> variable<a rel=
  "footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
  This variable is a list of key-value pairs (an <em>alist</em> in
  Emacs parlance), where the key gives a name to be shown for the
  examine command, and the value is the command strings itself, in
  which the text <code>___</code> (three underscores) will be
  replaced by the selected expression before being sent to the
  shell. An example might be key <code>Structure Help</code> with
  value <code>help,___,/STRUCTURE</code>. In that case, you'd be
  prompted with <em>Structure Help</em>, which might send something
  like <code>help,var,/STRUCTURE</code> to the shell for output.
  <code>idlwave-shell-examine-alist</code> comes configured by
  default with a large list of examine commands, but you can easily
  customize it to add your own.</p>

  <p>In addition to configuring the functions available to the
  pop-up mouse command, you can easily create your own customized
  bindings to inspect expressions using the two convenience macros
  <code>idlwave-shell-examine</code> and
  <code>idlwave-shell-mouse-examine</code>. These create keyboard
  or mouse-based custom inspections of variables, sharing all the
  same properties of the built-in examine commands. Both functions
  take a single string argument sharing the syntax of the
  <code>idlwave-shell-examine-alist</code> values, e.g.:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (add-hook 'idlwave-shell-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (idlwave-shell-define-key-both [s-down-mouse-2]
                                      (idlwave-shell-mouse-examine
                                       "print, size(___,/DIMENSIONS)"))
                 (idlwave-shell-define-key-both [f9] (idlwave-shell-examine
                                            "print, size(___,/DIMENSIONS)"))
                 (idlwave-shell-define-key-both [f10] (idlwave-shell-examine
                                             "print,size(___,/TNAME)"))
                 (idlwave-shell-define-key-both [f11] (idlwave-shell-examine
                                             "help,___,/STRUCTURE"))))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Now pressing &lt;f9&gt;, or middle-mouse
  dragging with the &lt;SUPER&gt; key depressed, will print the
  dimensions of the nearby or highlighted expression. Pressing
  &lt;f10&gt; will give the type string, and &lt;f11&gt; will show
  the contents of a nearby structure. As you can see, the
  possibilities are only marginally finite.</p>
