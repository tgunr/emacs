  <h3 class="section">3.1 Lesson I: Development Cycle</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this tutorial is to guide you through a very
  basic development cycle using IDLWAVE. We will paste a simple
  program into a buffer and use the shell to compile, debug and run
  it. On the way we will use many of the important IDLWAVE
  commands. Note, however, that IDLWAVE has many more capabilities
  than covered here, which can be discovered by reading the entire
  manual, or hovering over the shoulder of your nearest IDLWAVE
  guru for a few days.</p>

  <p>It is assumed that you have access to Emacs or XEmacs with the
  full IDLWAVE package including online help. We also assume that
  you are familiar with Emacs and can read the nomenclature of key
  presses in Emacs (in particular, <kbd>C</kbd> stands for
  &lt;CONTROL&gt; and <kbd>M</kbd> for &lt;META&gt; (often the
  &lt;ALT&gt; key carries this functionality)).</p>

  <p>Open a new source file by typing:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     <kbd>C-x C-f tutorial.pro &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
</pre>

  <p>A buffer for this file will pop up, and it should be in
  IDLWAVE mode, indicated in the mode line just below the editing
  window. Also, the menu bar should contain
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IDLWAVE</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Now cut-and-paste the following code, also available as
  <samp><span class="file">tutorial.pro</span></samp> in the
  IDLWAVE distribution.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     function daynr,d,m,y
       ;; compute a sequence number for a date
       ;; works 1901-2099.
       if y lt 100 then y = y+1900
       if m le 2 then delta = 1 else delta = 0
       m1 = m + delta*12 + 1
       y1 = y * delta
       return, d + floor(m1*30.6)+floor(y1*365.25)+5
     end

     function weekday,day,month,year
       ;; compute weekday number for date
       nr = daynr(day,month,year)
       return, nr mod 7
     end

     pro plot_wday,day,month
       ;; Plot the weekday of a date in the first 10 years of this century.
       years = 2000,+indgen(10)
       wdays = intarr(10)
       for i=0,n_elements(wdays)-1 do begin
           wdays[i] =  weekday(day,month,years[i])
       end
       plot,years,wdays,YS=2,YT="Wday (0=Sunday)"
     end
</pre>

  <p>The indentation probably looks funny, since it's different
  from the settings you use, so use the &lt;TAB&gt; key in each
  line to automatically line it up (or, more quickly,
  <em>select</em> the entire buffer with <kbd>C-x h</kbd>, and
  indent the whole region with <kbd>C-M-\</kbd>). Notice how
  different syntactical elements are highlighted in different
  colors, if you have set up support for font-lock.</p>

  <p>Let's check out two particular editing features of IDLWAVE.
  Place the cursor after the <code>end</code> statement of the
  <code>for</code> loop and press &lt;SPC&gt;. IDLWAVE blinks back
  to the beginning of the block and changes the generic
  <code>end</code> to the specific <code>endfor</code>
  automatically (as long as the variable
  <code>idlwave-expand-generic-end</code> is turned on &mdash; see
  <a href=
  "Lesson-II-_002d_002d-Customization.html#Lesson-II-_002d_002d-Customization">
  Lesson II &ndash; Customization</a>). Now place the cursor in any
  line you would like to split and press <kbd>M-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.
  The line is split at the cursor position, with the continuation
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  indentation all taken care of. Use <kbd>C-/</kbd> to undo the
  last change.</p>

  <p>The procedure <code>plot_wday</code> is supposed to plot the
  day of the week of a given date for the first 10 years of the
  21st century. As in most code, there are a few bugs, which we are
  going to use IDLWAVE to help us fix.</p>

  <p>First, let's launch the IDLWAVE shell. You do this with the
  command <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>. The Emacs window will split or
  another window will popup to display IDL running in a shell
  interaction buffer. Type a few commands like
  <code>print,!PI</code> to convince yourself that you can work
  there just as well as in a terminal, or the IDLDE. Use the arrow
  keys to cycle through your command history. Are we having fun
  now?</p>

  <p>Now go back to the source window and type <kbd>C-c C-d
  C-c</kbd> to compile the program. If you watch the shell buffer,
  you see that IDLWAVE types &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.run
  "tutorial.pro"</span></samp>&rsquo; for you. But the compilation
  fails because there is a comma in the line
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">years=...</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  The line with the error is highlighted and the cursor positioned
  at the error, so remove the comma (you should only need to hit
  <kbd>Delete</kbd>!). Compile again, using the same keystrokes as
  before. Notice that the file is automatically saved for you. This
  time everything should work fine, and you should see the three
  routines compile.</p>

  <p>Now we want to use the command to plot the day of the week on
  January 1st. We could type the full command ourselves, but why do
  that? Go back to the shell window, type &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">plot_</span></samp>&rsquo; and hit &lt;TAB&gt;. After a
  bit of a delay (while IDLWAVE initializes its routine info
  database, if necessary), the window will split to show all
  procedures it knows starting with that string, and
  <code>plot_wday</code><!-- /@w --> should be one of them. Saving
  the buffer alerted IDLWAVE about this new routine. Click with the
  middle mouse button on <code>plot_wday</code> and it will be
  copied to the shell buffer, or if you prefer, add
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plot_</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  make it unambiguous (depending on what other routines starting
  with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plot_</span></samp>&rsquo;
  you have installed on your system), hit &lt;TAB&gt; again, and
  the full routine name will be completed. Now provide the two
  arguments:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     plot_wday,1,1
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">and press &lt;RET&gt;. This fails with an
  error message telling you the <code>YT</code> keyword to plot is
  ambiguous. What are the allowed keywords again? Go back to the
  source window and put the cursor into the `plot' line and press
  <kbd>C-c ?</kbd>. This shows the routine info window for the plot
  routine, which contains a list of keywords, along with the
  argument list. Oh, we wanted <code>YTITLE</code>. Fix that up.
  Recompile with <kbd>C-c C-d C-c</kbd>. Jump back into the shell
  with <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>, press the &lt;UP&gt; arrow to recall the
  previous command and execute again.</p>

  <p>This time we get a plot, but it is pretty ugly &mdash; the
  points are all connected with a line. Hmm, isn't there a way for
  <code>plot</code> to use symbols instead? What was that keyword?
  Position the cursor on the plot line after a comma (where you'd
  normally type a keyword), and hit <kbd>M-&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd>. A
  long list of plot's keywords appears. Aha, there it is,
  <code>PSYM</code>. Middle click to insert it. An
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; sign is
  included for you too. Now what were the values of
  <code>PSYM</code> supposed to be? With the cursor on or after the
  keyword, press <kbd>M-?</kbd> for online help (alternatively, you
  could have right clicked on the colored keyword itself in the
  completion list). A browser will pop up showing the HTML
  documentation for the <code>PYSM</code> keyword. OK, let's use
  diamonds=4. Fix this, recompile (you know the command by now:
  <kbd>C-c C-d C-c</kbd>), go back to the shell (if it's vanished,
  you know what to do: <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>) and execute again. Now
  things look pretty good.</p>

  <p>Let's try a different day &mdash; how about April fool's
  day?</p>
  <pre class="example">
     plot_wday,1,4
</pre>

  <p>Oops, this looks very wrong. All April Fool's days cannot be
  Fridays! We've got a bug in the program, perhaps in the
  <code>daynr</code> function. Let's put a breakpoint on the last
  line there. Position the cursor on the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">return, d+...</span></samp>&rsquo; line and press <kbd>C-c
  C-d C-b</kbd>. IDL sets a breakpoint (as you see in the shell
  window), and the break line is indicated. Back to the shell
  buffer, re-execute the previous command. IDL stops at the line
  with the breakpoint. Now hold down the SHIFT key and click with
  the middle mouse button on a few variables there:
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y1</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.
  Maybe <code>d</code> isn't the correct type. CONTROL-SHIFT
  middle-click on it for help. Well, it's an integer, so that's not
  the problem. Aha, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">y1</span></samp>&rsquo; is zero, but it should be the
  year, depending on delta. Shift click &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">delta</span></samp>&rsquo; to see that it's 0. Below, we
  see the offending line: &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">y1=y*delta...</span></samp>&rsquo; the multiplication
  should have been a minus sign! Hit <kbd>q</kbd> to exit the
  debugging mode, and fix the line to read:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     y1 = y - delta
</pre>

  <p>Now remove all breakpoints: <kbd>C-c C-d C-a</kbd>. Recompile
  and rerun the command. Everything should now work fine. How about
  those leap years? Change the code to plot 100 years and see that
  every 28 years, the sequence of weekdays repeats.</p>
