  <h3 class="section">3.3 Lesson III: User and Library
  Catalogs</h3>

  <p>We have already used the routine info display in the first
  part of this tutorial. This was the invoked using <kbd>C-c
  ?</kbd>, and displays information about the IDL routine near the
  cursor position. Wouldn't it be nice to have the same kind of
  information available for your own routines and for the huge
  amount of code in major libraries like JHUPL or the IDL-Astro
  library? In many cases, you may already have this information.
  Files named <samp><span class=
  "file">.idlwave_catalog</span></samp> in library directories
  contain scanned information on the routines in that directory;
  many popular libraries ship with these &ldquo;library
  catalogs&rdquo; pre-scanned. Users can scan their own routines in
  one of two ways: either using the supplied tool to scan
  directories and build their own <samp><span class=
  "file">.idlwave_catalog</span></samp> files, or using the
  built-in method to create a single &ldquo;user catalog&rdquo;,
  which we'll show here. See <a href=
  "Catalogs.html#Catalogs">Catalogs</a>, for more information on
  choosing which method to use.</p>

  <p>To build a user catalog, select <code>Routine Info/Select
  Catalog Directories</code> from the IDLWAVE entry in the menu
  bar. If necessary, start the shell first with <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>
  (see <a href=
  "Starting-the-Shell.html#Starting-the-Shell">Starting the
  Shell</a>). IDLWAVE will find out about the IDL
  <code>!PATH</code> variable and offer a list of directories on
  the path. Simply select them all (or whichever you want &mdash;
  directories with existing library catalogs will not be selected
  by default) and click on the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Scan&amp;Save</span></samp>&rsquo; button. Then go for a
  cup of coffee while IDLWAVE collects information for each and
  every IDL routine on your search path. All this information is
  written to the file <samp><span class=
  "file">.idlwave/idlusercat.el</span></samp> in your home
  directory and will from now on automatically load whenever you
  use IDLWAVE. You may find it necessary to rebuild the catalog on
  occasion as your local libraries change, or build a library
  catalog for those directories instead. Invoke routine info
  (<kbd>C-c ?</kbd>) or completion (<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>) on
  any routine or partial routine name you know to be located in the
  library. E.g., if you have scanned the IDL-Astro library:</p>
  <pre class="example">
         a=readf&lt;M-&lt;TAB&gt;&gt;
</pre>

  <p>expands to `readfits('. Then try</p>
  <pre class="example">
         a=readfits(&lt;C-c ?&gt;
</pre>

  <p>and you get:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     Usage:    Result = READFITS(filename, header, heap)
     ...
</pre>

  <p>I hope you made it until here. Now you are set to work with
  IDLWAVE. On the way you will want to change other things, and to
  learn more about the possibilities not discussed in this short
  tutorial. Read the manual, look at the documentation strings of
  interesting variables (with <kbd>C-h v
  idlwave&lt;-variable-name&gt; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>) and ask the
  remaining questions on the newsgroup
  <code>comp.lang.idl-pvwave</code>.</p>
