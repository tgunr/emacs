  <h2 class="chapter">1 How Mail Works</h2>

  <p><a name="index-SMTP-1" id="index-SMTP-1"></a><a name=
  "index-MTA-2" id="index-MTA-2"></a> On the internet, mail is sent
  from mail host to mail host using the simple mail transfer
  protocol (SMTP). To send and receive mail, you must get it from
  and send it to a mail host. Every mail host runs a mail transfer
  agent (MTA) such as Exim that accepts mails and passes them on.
  The communication between a mail host and other clients does not
  necessarily involve SMTP, however. Here is short overview of what
  is involved.</p>

  <p><a name="index-MUA-3" id="index-MUA-3"></a> The mail program
  &mdash; also called a mail user agent (MUA) &mdash; usually sends
  outgoing mail to a mail host. When your computer is permanently
  connected to the internet, it might even be a mail host itself.
  In this case, the MUA will pipe mail to the <samp><span class=
  "file">/usr/lib/sendmail</span></samp> application. It will take
  care of your mail and pass it on to the next mail host.</p>

  <p><a name="index-ISP-4" id="index-ISP-4"></a> When you are only
  connected to the internet from time to time, your internet
  service provider (ISP) has probably told you which mail host to
  use. You must configure your MUA to use that mail host. Since you
  are reading this manual, you probably want to configure Emacs to
  use SMTP to send mail to that mail host. More on that in the next
  section.</p>

  <p><a name="index-MDA-5" id="index-MDA-5"></a> Things are
  different when reading mail. The mail host responsible for your
  mail keeps it in a file somewhere. The messages get into the file
  by way of a mail delivery agent (MDA) such as procmail. These
  delivery agents often allow you to filter and munge your mails
  before you get to see it. When your computer is that mail host,
  this file is called a spool, and sometimes located in the
  directory <samp><span class=
  "file">/var/spool/mail/</span></samp>. All your MUA has to do is
  read mail from the spool, then.</p>

  <p><a name="index-POP3-6" id="index-POP3-6"></a><a name=
  "index-IMAP-7" id="index-IMAP-7"></a> When your computer is not
  always connected to the internet, you must get the mail from the
  remote mail host using a protocol such as POP3 or IMAP. POP3
  essentially downloads all your mail from the mail host to your
  computer. The mail is stored in some file on your computer, and
  again, all your MUA has to do is read mail from the spool.</p>

  <p>When you read mail from various machines, downloading mail
  from the mail host to your current machine is not convenient. In
  that case, you will probably want to use the IMAP protocol. Your
  mail is kept on the mail host, and you can read it while you are
  connected via IMAP to the mail host.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Webmail-8" id="index-Webmail-8"></a> So how
  does reading mail via the web work, you ask. In that case, the
  web interface just allows you to remote-control a MUA on the web
  host. Whether the web host is also a mail host, and how all the
  pieces interact is completely irrelevant. You usually cannot use
  Emacs to read mail via the web, unless you use software that
  parses the ever-changing HTML of the web interface.</p>
