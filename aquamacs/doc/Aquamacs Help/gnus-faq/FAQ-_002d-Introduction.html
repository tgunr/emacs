  <h4 class="subheading">Introduction</h4>

  <p>This is the Gnus Frequently Asked Questions list.</p>

  <p>Gnus is a Usenet Newsreader and Electronic Mail User Agent
  implemented as a part of Emacs. It's been around in some form for
  almost a decade now, and has been distributed as a standard part
  of Emacs for much of that time. Gnus 5 is the latest (and
  greatest) incarnation. The original version was called GNUS, and
  was written by Masanobu UMEDA. When autumn crept up in '94, Lars
  Magne Ingebrigtsen grew bored and decided to rewrite Gnus.</p>

  <p>Its biggest strength is the fact that it is extremely
  customizable. It is somewhat intimidating at first glance, but
  most of the complexity can be ignored until you're ready to take
  advantage of it. If you receive a reasonable volume of e-mail
  (you're on various mailing lists), or you would like to read
  high-volume mailing lists but cannot keep up with them, or read
  high volume newsgroups or are just bored, then Gnus is what you
  want.</p>

  <p>This FAQ was maintained by Justin Sheehy until March 2002. He
  would like to thank Steve Baur and Per Abrahamsen for doing a
  wonderful job with this FAQ before him. We would like to do the
  same - thanks, Justin!</p>

  <p>This version is much nicer than the unofficial hypertext
  versions that are archived at Utrecht, Oxford, Smart Pages, Ohio
  State, and other FAQ archives. See the resources question below
  if you want information on obtaining it in another format.</p>

  <p>The information contained here was compiled with the
  assistance of the Gnus development mailing list, and any errors
  or misprints are the Gnus team's fault, sorry.</p>
