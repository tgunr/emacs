  <h5 class="subsubheading">Question 3.8</h5>

  <p>OK, reading news works now, but I want to be able to read my
  mail with Gnus, too. How to do it?</p>

  <h5 class="subsubheading">Answer</h5>

  <p>That's a bit harder since there are many possible sources for
  mail, many possible ways for storing mail and many different ways
  for sending mail. The most common cases are these: 1: You want to
  read your mail from a pop3 server and send them directly to a
  SMTP Server 2: Some program like fetchmail retrieves your mail
  and stores it on disk from where Gnus shall read it. Outgoing
  mail is sent by Sendmail, Postfix or some other MTA. Sometimes,
  you even need a combination of the above cases.</p>

  <p>However, the first thing to do is to tell Gnus in which way it
  should store the mail, in Gnus terminology which back end to use.
  Gnus supports many different back ends, the most commonly used
  one is nnml. It stores every mail in one file and is therefor
  quite fast. However you might prefer a one file per group
  approach if your file system has problems with many small files,
  the nnfolder back end is then probably the choice for you. To use
  nnml add the following to ~/.gnus.el:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnml ""))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">As you might have guessed, if you want
  nnfolder, it's</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnfolder ""))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Now we need to tell Gnus, where to get it's
  mail from. If it's a POP3 server, then you need something like
  this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(pop :server "pop.YourProvider.net"
                                         :user "yourUserName"
                                         :password "yourPassword")))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Make sure ~/.gnus.el isn't readable to others
  if you store your password there. If you want to read your mail
  from a traditional spool file on your local machine, it's</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(file :path "/path/to/spool/file"))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">If it's a Maildir, with one file per message
  as used by postfix, Qmail and (optionally) fetchmail it's</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(maildir :path "/path/to/Maildir/"
                                             :subdirs ("cur" "new")))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">And finally if you want to read your mail
  from several files in one directory, for example because procmail
  already split your mail, it's</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources
                     '(directory :path "/path/to/procmail-dir/"
                                 :suffix ".prcml")))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Where :suffix ".prcml" tells Gnus only to use
  files with the suffix .prcml.</p>

  <p>OK, now you only need to tell Gnus how to send mail. If you
  want to send mail via sendmail (or whichever MTA is playing the
  role of sendmail on your system), you don't need to do anything.
  However, if you want to send your mail to an SMTP Server you need
  the following in your ~/.gnus.el</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     (setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.yourProvider.net")
</pre>
