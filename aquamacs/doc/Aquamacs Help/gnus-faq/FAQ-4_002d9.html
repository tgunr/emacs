  <h5 class="subsubheading">Question 4.9</h5>

  <p>Is there a way to automatically ignore posts by specific
  authors or with specific words in the subject? And can I
  highlight more interesting ones in some way?</p>

  <h5 class="subsubheading">Answer</h5>

  <p>You want Scoring. Scoring means, that you define rules which
  assign each message an integer value. Depending on the value the
  message is highlighted in summary buffer (if it's high, say
  +2000) or automatically marked read (if the value is low, say
  -800) or some other action happens.</p>

  <p>There are basically three ways of setting up rules which
  assign the scoring-value to messages. The first and easiest way
  is to set up rules based on the article you are just reading. Say
  you're reading a message by a guy who always writes nonsense and
  you want to ignore his messages in the future. Hit
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo;, to set up
  a rule which lowers the score. Now Gnus asks you which the
  criteria for lowering the Score shall be. Hit
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; twice to
  see all possibilities, we want &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; which means the author (the from
  header). Now Gnus wants to know which kind of matching we want.
  Hit either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo;
  for an exact match or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; for substring-match and delete
  afterwards everything but the name to score down all authors with
  the given name no matter which email address is used. Now you
  need to tell Gnus when to apply the rule and how long it should
  last, hit e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; to apply the rule now and let it
  last forever. If you want to raise the score instead of lowering
  it say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>&rsquo;
  instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>You can also set up rules by hand. To do this say
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">V f</span></samp>&rsquo; in
  summary buffer. Then you are asked for the name of the score
  file, it's name.of.group.SCORE for rules valid in only one group
  or all.Score for rules valid in all groups. See the Gnus manual
  for the exact syntax, basically it's one big list whose elements
  are lists again. the first element of those lists is the header
  to score on, then one more list with what to match, which score
  to assign, when to expire the rule and how to do the matching. If
  you find me very interesting, you could e.g. add the following to
  your all.Score:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (("references" ("hschmi22.userfqdn.rz-online.de" 500 nil s))
      ("message-id" ("hschmi22.userfqdn.rz-online.de" 999 nil s)))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">This would add 999 to the score of messages
  written by me and 500 to the score of messages which are a
  (possibly indirect) answer to a message written by me. Of course
  nobody with a sane mind would do this :-)</p>

  <p>The third alternative is adaptive scoring. This means Gnus
  watches you and tries to find out what you find interesting and
  what annoying and sets up rules which reflect this. Adaptive
  scoring can be a huge help when reading high traffic groups. If
  you want to activate adaptive scoring say</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (setq gnus-use-adaptive-scoring t)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">in ~/.gnus.el.</p>
