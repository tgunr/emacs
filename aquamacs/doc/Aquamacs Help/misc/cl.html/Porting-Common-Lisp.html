  <h2 class="appendix">Appendix C Porting Common Lisp</h2>

  <p>This package is meant to be used as an extension to Emacs
  Lisp, not as an Emacs implementation of true Common Lisp. Some of
  the remaining differences between Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp make
  it difficult to port large Common Lisp applications to Emacs. For
  one, some of the features in this package are not fully compliant
  with ANSI or Steele; see <a href=
  "Common-Lisp-Compatibility.html#Common-Lisp-Compatibility">Common
  Lisp Compatibility</a>. But there are also quite a few features
  that this package does not provide at all. Here are some major
  omissions that you will want to watch out for when bringing
  Common Lisp code into Emacs.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Case-insensitivity. Symbols in Common Lisp are
    case-insensitive by default. Some programs refer to a function
    or variable as <code>foo</code> in one place and
    <code>Foo</code> or <code>FOO</code> in another. Emacs Lisp
    will treat these as three distinct symbols.

      <p>Some Common Lisp code is written entirely in upper case.
      While Emacs is happy to let the program&rsquo;s own functions
      and variables use this convention, calls to Lisp builtins
      like <code>if</code> and <code>defun</code> will have to be
      changed to lower case.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Lexical scoping. In Common Lisp, function arguments and
    <code>let</code> bindings apply only to references physically
    within their bodies (or within macro expansions in their
    bodies). Traditionally, Emacs Lisp uses <em>dynamic
    scoping</em> wherein a binding to a variable is visible even
    inside functions called from the body. See <a href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dynamic-Binding.html#Dynamic-Binding">
      Dynamic Binding</a> in <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference
      Manual</cite>. Lexical binding is available since Emacs 24.1,
      so be sure to set <code>lexical-binding</code> to
      <code>t</code> if you need to emulate this aspect of Common
      Lisp. See <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Lexical-Binding.html#Lexical-Binding">
      Lexical Binding</a> in <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference
      Manual</cite>.

      <p>Here is an example of a Common Lisp code fragment that
      would fail in Emacs Lisp if <code>lexical-binding</code> were
      set to <code>nil</code>:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
(defun map-odd-elements (func list)
  (loop for x in list
        for flag = t then (not flag)
        collect (if flag x (funcall func x))))

(defun add-odd-elements (list x)
  (map-odd-elements (lambda (a) (+ a x)) list))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>With lexical binding, the two functions&rsquo; usages of
      <code>x</code> are completely independent. With dynamic
      binding, the binding to <code>x</code> made by
      <code>add-odd-elements</code> will have been hidden by the
      binding in <code>map-odd-elements</code> by the time the
      <code>(+ a x)</code> function is called.</p>

      <p>Internally, this package uses lexical binding so that such
      problems do not occur. See <a href=
      "Obsolete-Lexical-Binding.html#Obsolete-Lexical-Binding">Obsolete
      Lexical Binding</a>, for a description of the obsolete
      <code>lexical-let</code> form that emulates a Common
      Lisp-style lexical binding when dynamic binding is in
      use.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Reader macros. Common Lisp includes a second type of macro
    that works at the level of individual characters. For example,
    Common Lisp implements the quote notation by a reader macro
    called <code>'</code>, whereas Emacs Lisp&rsquo;s parser just
    treats quote as a special case. Some Lisp packages use reader
    macros to create special syntaxes for themselves, which the
    Emacs parser is incapable of reading.</li>

    <li>Other syntactic features. Common Lisp provides a number of
    notations beginning with <code>#</code> that the Emacs Lisp
    parser won&rsquo;t understand. For example, &lsquo;<samp>#|
    &hellip; |#</samp>&rsquo; is an alternate comment notation, and
    &lsquo;<samp>#+lucid (foo)</samp>&rsquo; tells the parser to
    ignore the <code>(foo)</code> except in Lucid Common Lisp.</li>

    <li>Packages. In Common Lisp, symbols are divided into
    <em>packages</em>. Symbols that are Lisp built-ins are
    typically stored in one package; symbols that are vendor
    extensions are put in another, and each application program
    would have a package for its own symbols. Certain symbols are
    &ldquo;exported&rdquo; by a package and others are internal;
    certain packages &ldquo;use&rdquo; or import the exported
    symbols of other packages. To access symbols that would not
    normally be visible due to this importing and exporting, Common
    Lisp provides a syntax like <code>package:symbol</code> or
    <code>package::symbol</code>.

      <p>Emacs Lisp has a single namespace for all interned
      symbols, and then uses a naming convention of putting a
      prefix like <code>cl-</code> in front of the name. Some Emacs
      packages adopt the Common Lisp-like convention of using
      <code>cl:</code> or <code>cl::</code> as the prefix. However,
      the Emacs parser does not understand colons and just treats
      them as part of the symbol name. Thus, while
      <code>mapcar</code> and <code>lisp:mapcar</code> may refer to
      the same symbol in Common Lisp, they are totally distinct in
      Emacs Lisp. Common Lisp programs that refer to a symbol by
      the full name sometimes and the short name other times will
      not port cleanly to Emacs.</p>

      <p>Emacs Lisp does have a concept of &ldquo;obarrays&rdquo;,
      which are package-like collections of symbols, but this
      feature is not strong enough to be used as a true package
      mechanism.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The <code>format</code> function is quite different between
    Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp. It takes an additional
    &ldquo;destination&rdquo; argument before the format string. A
    destination of <code>nil</code> means to format to a string as
    in Emacs Lisp; a destination of <code>t</code> means to write
    to the terminal (similar to <code>message</code> in Emacs).
    Also, format control strings are utterly different;
    <code>~</code> is used instead of <code>%</code> to introduce
    format codes, and the set of available codes is much richer.
    There are no notations like <code>\n</code> for string
    literals; instead, <code>format</code> is used with the
    &ldquo;newline&rdquo; format code, <code>~%</code>. More
    advanced formatting codes provide such features as paragraph
    filling, case conversion, and even loops and conditionals.

      <p>While it would have been possible to implement most of
      Common Lisp <code>format</code> in this package (under the
      name <code>cl-format</code>, of course), it was not deemed
      worthwhile. It would have required a huge amount of code to
      implement even a decent subset of <code>format</code>, yet
      the functionality it would provide over Emacs Lisp&rsquo;s
      <code>format</code> would rarely be useful.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Vector constants use square brackets in Emacs Lisp, but
    <code>#(a b c)</code> notation in Common Lisp. To further
    complicate matters, Emacs has its own <code>#(</code> notation
    for something entirely different&mdash;strings with
    properties.</li>

    <li>Characters are distinct from integers in Common Lisp. The
    notation for character constants is also different:
    <code>#\A</code> in Common Lisp where Emacs Lisp uses
    <code>?A</code>. Also, <code>string=</code> and
    <code>string-equal</code> are synonyms in Emacs Lisp, whereas
    the latter is case-insensitive in Common Lisp.</li>

    <li>Data types. Some Common Lisp data types do not exist in
    Emacs Lisp. Rational numbers and complex numbers are not
    present, nor are large integers (all integers are
    &ldquo;fixnums&rdquo;). All arrays are one-dimensional. There
    are no readtables or pathnames; streams are a set of existing
    data types rather than a new data type of their own. Hash
    tables, random-states, structures, and packages (obarrays) are
    built from Lisp vectors or lists rather than being distinct
    types.</li>

    <li>The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) is not implemented,
    nor is the Common Lisp Condition System. However, the EIEIO
    package (see <a href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eieio/index.html#Top">
    Introduction</a> in <cite>EIEIO</cite>) does implement some
    CLOS functionality.</li>

    <li>Common Lisp features that are completely redundant with
    Emacs Lisp features of a different name generally have not been
    implemented. For example, Common Lisp writes
    <code>defconstant</code> where Emacs Lisp uses
    <code>defconst</code>. Similarly, <code>make-list</code> takes
    its arguments in different ways in the two Lisps but does
    exactly the same thing, so this package has not bothered to
    implement a Common Lisp-style <code>make-list</code>.</li>

    <li>A few more notable Common Lisp features not included in
    this package: <code>compiler-let</code>, <code>prog</code>,
    <code>ldb/dpb</code>, <code>cerror</code>.</li>

    <li>Recursion. While recursion works in Emacs Lisp just like it
    does in Common Lisp, various details of the Emacs Lisp system
    and compiler make recursion much less efficient than it is in
    most Lisps. Some schools of thought prefer to use recursion in
    Lisp over other techniques; they would sum a list of numbers
    using something like

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
(defun sum-list (list)
  (if list
      (+ (car list) (sum-list (cdr list)))
    0))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>where a more iteratively-minded programmer might write one
      of these forms:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
(let ((total 0)) (dolist (x my-list) (incf total x)) total)
(loop for x in my-list sum x)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>While this would be mainly a stylistic choice in most
      Common Lisps, in Emacs Lisp you should be aware that the
      iterative forms are much faster than recursion. Also, Lisp
      programmers will want to note that the current Emacs Lisp
      compiler does not optimize tail recursion.</p>
    </li>
