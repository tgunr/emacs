  <p>Emacs can edit several files at once. A file in Emacs is
  placed in a <em>buffer</em> that usually has the same name as the
  file. Buffers are also used for other purposes, such as shell
  interfaces, directory editing, etc. See <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html#Dired">
  Directory Editor</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>, for an
  example.</p>

  <p>A buffer has a distinguished position called the
  <em>point</em>. A <em>point</em> is always between 2 characters,
  and is <em>looking at</em> the right hand character. The cursor
  is positioned on the right hand character. Thus, when the
  <em>point</em> is looking at the end-of-line, the cursor is on
  the end-of-line character, i.e., beyond the last character on the
  line. This is the default Emacs behavior.</p>

  <p>The default settings of Viper try to mimic the behavior of Vi,
  preventing the cursor from going beyond the last character on the
  line. By using Emacs commands directly (such as those bound to
  arrow keys), it is possible to get the cursor beyond the
  end-of-line. However, this won&rsquo;t (or shouldn&rsquo;t)
  happen if you restrict yourself to standard Vi keys, unless you
  modify the default editing style. See <a href=
  "Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition to the <em>point</em>, there is another
  distinguished buffer position called the <em>mark</em>. See
  <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Mark.html#Mark">
  Mark</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs manual</cite>, for more info on
  the mark. The text between the <em>point</em> and the
  <em>mark</em> is called the <em>region</em> of the buffer. For
  the Viper user, this simply means that in addition to the Vi
  textmarkers a&ndash;z, there is another marker called
  <em>mark</em>. This is similar to the unnamed Vi marker used by
  the jump commands <kbd>``</kbd> and <kbd>''</kbd>, which move the
  cursor to the position of the last absolute jump. Viper provides
  access to the region in most text manipulation commands as
  <kbd>r</kbd> and <kbd>R</kbd> suffix to commands that operate on
  text regions, e.g., <kbd>dr</kbd> to delete region, etc.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Viper lets Ex-style commands to work on the
  current region. This is done by typing a digit argument before
  <kbd>:</kbd>. For instance, typing <kbd>1:</kbd> will prompt you
  with something like <em>:123,135</em>, assuming that the current
  region starts at line 123 and ends at line 135. There is no need
  to type the line numbers, since Viper inserts them automatically
  in front of the Ex command.</p>

  <p>See <a href="Basics.html#Basics">Basics</a>, for more
  info.</p><a name="index-window" id="index-window"></a> <a name=

  <p>Emacs divides the screen into tiled <em>windows</em>. You can
  see the contents of a buffer through the window associated with
  the buffer. The cursor of the screen is positioned on the
  character after <em>point</em>. Every window has a <em>mode
  line</em> that displays information about the buffer. You can
  change the format of the mode line, but normally if you see
  &lsquo;<samp>**</samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of a mode line it
  means that the buffer is <em>modified</em>. If you write out the
  contents of a buffer to a file, then the buffer will become not
  modified. Also if you see &lsquo;<samp>%%</samp>&rsquo; at the
  beginning of the mode line, it means that the file associated
  with the buffer is write protected. The mode line will also show
  the buffer name and current major and minor modes (see below). A
  special buffer called <em>Minibuffer</em> is displayed as the
  last line in a minibuffer window. The minibuffer window is used
  for command input output. Viper uses minibuffer window for
  <kbd>/</kbd> and <kbd>:</kbd> commands.</p><a name="index-mode"

  <p>An Emacs buffer can have a <em>major mode</em> that customizes
  Emacs for editing text of a particular sort by changing the
  functionality of the keys. Keys are defined using a
  <em>keymap</em> that records the bindings between keystrokes and
  functions. The <em>global keymap</em> is common to all the
  buffers. Additionally, each buffer has its <em>local keymap</em>
  that determines the <em>mode</em> of the buffer. If a function is
  bound to some key in the local keymap then that function will be
  executed when you type the key. If no function is bound to a key
  in the local map, however, the function bound to the key in the
  global map will be executed. See <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">
  Major Modes</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>, for more
  information.</p>

  <p>A buffer can also have a <em>minor mode</em>. Minor modes are
  options that you can use or not. A buffer in
  <code>text-mode</code> can have <code>auto-fill-mode</code> as
  minor mode, which can be turned off or on at any time. In Emacs,
  a minor mode may have it own keymap, which overrides the local
  keymap when the minor mode is turned on. For more information,
  see <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">
  Minor Modes</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>.</p><a name=
  "index-Viper-as-minor-mode" id="index-Viper-as-minor-mode"></a>
  <a name="index-Control-keys" id="index-Control-keys"></a>
  <a name="index-Meta-key" id="index-Meta-key"></a>

  <p>Viper is implemented as a collection of minor modes. Different
  minor modes are involved when Viper emulates Vi command mode, Vi
  insert mode, etc. You can also turn Viper on and off at any time
  while in Vi command mode. See <a href=
  "States-in-Viper.html#States-in-Viper">States in Viper</a>, for
  more information.</p>

  <p>Emacs uses Control and Meta modifiers. These are denoted as C
  and M, e.g., <kbd>^Z</kbd> as <kbd>C-z</kbd> and
  <kbd>Meta-x</kbd> as <kbd>M-x</kbd>. The Meta key is usually
  located on each side of the Space bar; it is used in a manner
  similar to the Control key, e.g., <kbd>M-x</kbd> means typing
  <kbd>x</kbd> while holding the Meta key down. For keyboards that
  do not have a Meta key, <tt class="key">ESC</tt> is used as Meta.
  Thus <kbd>M-x</kbd> is typed as <kbd><span class="key">ESC</span>
  x</kbd>. Viper uses <tt class="key">ESC</tt> to switch from
  Insert state to Vi state. Therefore Viper defines <kbd>C-\</kbd>
  as its Meta key in Vi state. See <a href=
  "Vi-State.html#Vi-State">Vi State</a>, for more info.</p>

  <p>Emacs is structured as a Lisp interpreter around a C core.
  Emacs keys cause Lisp functions to be called. It is possible to
  call these functions directly, by typing <kbd>M-x
  function-name</kbd>.</p>
