  "index-key-bindings" id="index-key-bindings"></a> <a name=
  "index-keymaps" id="index-keymaps"></a>

  <p>Viper lets you define hot keys, i.e., you can associate
  keyboard keys such as F1, Help, PgDn, etc., with Emacs Lisp
  functions (that may already exist or that you will write). Each
  key has a &ldquo;preferred form&rdquo; in Emacs. For instance,
  the Up key&rsquo;s preferred form is [up], the Help key&rsquo;s
  preferred form is [help], and the Undo key has the preferred form
  [f14]. You can find out the preferred form of a key by typing
  <kbd>M-x describe-key-briefly</kbd> and then typing the key you
  want to know about.</p>

  <p>Under the X Window System, every keyboard key emits its
  preferred form, so you can just type</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(global-set-key [f11] 'calendar)                        ; L1, Stop
(global-set-key [f14] 'undo)                            ; L4, Undo
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>to bind L1 (a key that exists on some SUN workstations) so it
  will invoke the Emacs Calendar and to bind L4 so it will undo
  changes. However, on a dumb terminal or in an Xterm window, even
  the standard arrow keys may not emit the right signals for Emacs
  to understand. To let Emacs know about those keys, you will have
  to find out which key sequences they emit by typing
  <kbd>C-q</kbd> and then the key (you should switch to Emacs state
  first). Then you can bind those sequences to their preferred
  forms using <code>input-decode-map</code> as follows:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(cond ((string= (getenv "TERM") "xterm")
(define-key input-decode-map "\e[192z" [f11])    ; L1
(define-key input-decode-map "\e[195z" [f14])    ; L4, Undo
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The above illustrates how to do this for Xterm. On VT100, you
  would have to replace "xterm" with "vt100" and also change the
  key sequences (the same key may emit different sequences on
  different types of terminals).</p>

  <p>The above keys are global, so they are overwritten by the
  local maps defined by the major modes and by Viper itself.
  Therefore, if you wish to change a binding set by a major mode or
  by Viper, read this.</p>

  <p>Viper users who wish to specify their own key bindings should
  be concerned only with the following three keymaps:
  <code>viper-vi-global-user-map</code> for Vi state commands,
  <code>viper-insert-global-user-map</code> for Insert state
  commands, and <code>viper-emacs-global-user-map</code> for Emacs
  state commands (note: customized bindings for Emacs state made to
  <code>viper-emacs-global-user-map</code> are <em>not</em>
  inherited by Insert state).</p>

  <p>For more information on Viper keymaps, see the header of the
  file <samp>viper.el</samp>. If you wish to change a Viper
  binding, you can use the <code>define-key</code> command, to
  modify <code>viper-vi-global-user-map</code>,
  <code>viper-insert-global-user-map</code>, and
  <code>viper-emacs-global-user-map</code>, as explained below.
  Each of these key maps affects the corresponding Viper state. The
  keymap <code>viper-insert-global-user-map</code> also affects
  Viper&rsquo;s Replace state.</p>

  <p>If you want to bind a key, say <kbd>C-v</kbd>, to the function
  that scrolls page down and to make <kbd>0</kbd> display
  information on the current buffer, putting this in your Viper
  customization file will do the trick in Vi state:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(define-key viper-vi-global-user-map "\C-v" 'scroll-down)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>To set a key globally,</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(define-key viper-emacs-global-user-map "\C-c m" 'smail)
(define-key viper-vi-global-user-map "0" 'viper-info-on-file)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Note, however, that this binding may be overwritten by other
  keymaps, since the global keymap has the lowest priority. To make
  sure that nothing will override a binding in Emacs state, you can
  write this:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(define-key viper-emacs-global-user-map "\C-c m" 'smail)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>To customize the binding for <kbd>C-h</kbd> in Insert
  state:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(define-key viper-insert-global-user-map "\C-h"
  'my-del-backwards-function)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Each Emacs command key calls some Lisp function. If you have
  enabled the Help, (see <a href=
  "Rudimentary-Changes.html#Rudimentary-Changes">Rudimentary
  Changes</a>) <kbd>C-h k</kbd> will show you the function for each
  specific key; <kbd>C-h b</kbd> will show all bindings, and
  <kbd>C-h m</kbd> will provide information on the major mode in
  effect. If Help is not enabled, you can still get help in Vi
  state by prefixing the above commands with <kbd>\</kbd>, e.g.,
  <kbd>\ C-h k</kbd> (or you can use the Help menu in the menu bar,
  if Emacs runs under X).</p>

  <p>Viper users can also change bindings on a per major mode
  basis. As with global bindings, this can be done separately for
  each of the three main Viper states. To this end, Viper provides
  the function <code>viper-modify-major-mode</code>. <a name=
  "index-viper_002dmodify_002dmajor_002dmode" id=
  "index-viper_002dmodify_002dmajor_002dmode"></a></p>

  <p>To modify keys in Emacs state for
  <code>my-favorite-major-mode</code>, the user needs to create a
  sparse keymap, say, <code>my-fancy-map</code>, bind whatever keys
  necessary in that keymap, and put</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(viper-modify-major-mode 'dired-mode 'emacs-state my-fancy-map)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>in your Viper customization file. To do the same in Vi and
  Insert states, you should use <code>vi-state</code> and
  <code>insert-state</code>. Changes in Insert state are also in
  effect in Replace state. For instance, suppose that the user
  wants to use <kbd>dd</kbd> in Vi state under Dired mode to delete
  files, <kbd>u</kbd> to unmark files, etc. The following code in
  the Viper customization file will then do the job:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(setq my-dired-modifier-map (make-sparse-keymap))
(define-key my-dired-modifier-map "dd" 'dired-flag-file-deletion)
(define-key my-dired-modifier-map "u" 'dired-unmark)
(viper-modify-major-mode 'dired-mode 'vi-state my-dired-modifier-map)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>A Vi purist may want to modify Emacs state under Dired mode so
  that <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd>, etc., will move around in
  directory buffers, as in Vi. Although this is not recommended, as
  these keys are bound to useful Dired functions, the trick can be
  accomplished via the following code:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(setq my-dired-vi-purist-map (make-sparse-keymap))
(define-key my-dired-vi-purist-map "k" 'viper-previous-line)
(define-key my-dired-vi-purist-map "l" 'viper-forward-char)
(viper-modify-major-mode 'dired-mode
                         'emacs-state my-dired-vi-purist-map)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Yet another way to customize key bindings in a major mode is
  to edit the list <code>viper-major-mode-modifier-list</code>
  using the customization widget. <a name=
  "index-viper_002dmajor_002dmode_002dmodifier_002dlist" id=
  "index-viper_002dmajor_002dmode_002dmodifier_002dlist"></a> (This
  variable is in the Viper-misc customization group.) The elements
  of this list are triples of the form: (major-mode viper-state
  keymap), where the keymap contains bindings that are supposed to
  be active in the given major mode and the given viper-state.</p>

  <p>Effects similar to key binding changes can be achieved by
  defining Vi keyboard macros using the Ex commands <kbd>:map</kbd>
  and <kbd>:map!</kbd>. The difference is that multi-key Vi macros
  do not override the keys they are bound to, unless these keys are
  typed in quick succession. So, with macros, one can use the
  normal keys alongside with the macros. If per-mode modifications
  are needed, the user can try both ways and see which one is more
  convenient. <a name="index-Ex-map" id="index-Ex-map"></a> See
  <a href="Vi-Macros.html#Vi-Macros">Vi Macros</a>, for
  details.</p>

  <p>Note: in major modes that come up in <em>Emacs state</em> by
  default, the aforesaid modifications may not take place
  immediately (but only after the buffer switches to some other
  Viper state and then back to Emacs state). To avoid this, one
  should add <code>viper-change-state-to-emacs</code> to an
  appropriate hook of that major mode. (Check the function
  <code>viper-set-hooks</code> in <samp>viper.el</samp> for
  examples.) However, if you did not set <code>viper-always</code>
  to <code>nil</code>, chances are that you won&rsquo;t need to
  perform the above procedure, because Viper will take care of most
  useful defaults.</p>

  <p>Finally, Viper has a facility that lets the user define
  per-buffer bindings, i.e., bindings that are in effect in some
  specific buffers only. Unlike per-mode bindings described above,
  per-buffer bindings can be defined based on considerations other
  than the major mode. This is done via the function
  <code>viper-add-local-keys</code>, which lets one specify
  bindings that should be in effect in the current buffer only and
  for a specific Viper state. For instance,</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(viper-add-local-keys 'vi-state '(("ZZ" . TeX-command-master)
                                 ("ZQ" . viper-save-kill-buffer)))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>redefines <kbd>ZZ</kbd> to invoke
  <code>TeX-command-master</code> in <code>vi-state</code> and
  <kbd>ZQ</kbd> to save-then-kill the current buffer. These
  bindings take effect only in the buffer where this command is
  executed. The typical use of this function is to execute the
  above expression from within a function that is included in a
  hook to some major mode. For instance, the above expression could
  be called from a function, <code>my-tex-init</code>, which may be
  added to <code>tex-mode-hook</code> as follows:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(add-hook 'tex-mode-hook 'my-tex-init)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>When TeX mode starts, the hook is executed and the above Lisp
  expression is evaluated. Then, the bindings for <kbd>ZZ</kbd> and
  <kbd>ZQ</kbd> are changed in Vi command mode for all buffers in
  TeX mode.</p>

  <p>Another useful application is to bind <kbd>ZZ</kbd> to
  <code>send-mail</code> in the Mail mode buffers (the specifics of
  this depend on which mail package you are using,
  <code>rmail</code>, <code>mh-e</code>, <code>vm</code>, etc. For
  instance, here is how to do this for <code>mh-e</code>, the Emacs
  interface to MH:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(defun mh-add-vi-keys ()
  "Set up ZZ for MH-e and XMH."
  (viper-add-local-keys 'vi-state '(("ZZ" . mh-send-letter))))
(add-hook 'mh-letter-mode-hook 'mh-add-vi-keys)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>You can also use <code>viper-add-local-keys</code> to set per
  buffer bindings in Insert state and Emacs state by passing as a
  parameter the symbols <code>insert-state</code> and
  <code>emacs-state</code>, respectively. As with global bindings,
  customized local bindings done to Emacs state are not inherited
  by Insert state.</p>

  <p>On rare occasions, local keys may be added by mistake. Usually
  this is done indirectly, by invoking a major mode that adds local
  keys (e.g., <code>shell-mode</code> redefines <tt class=
  "key">RET</tt>). In such a case, exiting the wrong major mode
  won&rsquo;t rid you from unwanted local keys, since these keys
  are local to Viper state and the current buffer, not to the major
  mode. In such situations, the remedy is to type <kbd>M-x
  viper-zap-local-keys</kbd>.</p>
