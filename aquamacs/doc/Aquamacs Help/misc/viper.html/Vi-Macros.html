  <h3 class="section">3.5 Vi Macros</h3><a name="index-Vi-macros"
  id="index-Vi-macros"></a>

  <p>Viper supports much enhanced Vi-style macros and also
  facilitates the use of Emacs-style macros. To define a temporary
  macro, it is generally more convenient to use Emacs keyboard
  macro facility. Emacs keyboard macros are usually defined
  anonymously, and the latest macro can be executed by typing
  <kbd>C-x e</kbd> (or <kbd>*</kbd>, if Viper is in Vi state). If
  you need to use several temporary macros, Viper lets you save
  them to a register (a lowercase letter); such macros can then be
  executed by typing <kbd>@a</kbd> in Vi state (if a macro was
  previously saved in register <kbd>a</kbd>). See <a href=
  "Macros-and-Registers.html#Macros-and-Registers">Macros and
  Registers</a>, for details.</p>

  <p>If, however, you need to use a macro regularly, it must be
  given a permanent name and saved. Emacs manual explains how to do
  this, but invocation of named Emacs macros is quite different
  from Vi&rsquo;s. First, invocation of permanent Emacs macros
  takes time because it requires typing too many keys (to a Vi
  user&rsquo;s taste, anyway). Second, binding such macros to
  function keys, for fast access, hogs valuable real estate on the
  keyboard.</p>

  <p>Vi-style macros are better in that respect, since Vi lets the
  user overload the meaning of key sequences: keys typed in fast
  succession are treated specially, if this key sequence is bound
  to a macro.</p>

  <p>Viper provides Vi-style keyboard macros through the usual Ex
  commands, <kbd>:map</kbd> and <kbd>:map!</kbd>. These macros are
  much more powerful in Viper than they are in the original Vi and
  in other emulators. This is because Viper implements an enhanced
  vi-style interface to the powerful Emacs keyboard macro
  facility.</p>

  <p>First, any Emacs command can be executed while defining a
  macro, not just the Vi commands. In particular, the user can
  invoke Emacs commands via <kbd>M-x command-name</kbd> or by
  pressing various function keys on the keyboard. One can even use
  the mouse, although this is usually not useful and is not
  recommended (and macros defined with the use of the mouse cannot
  be saved in command history and in the startup file, for future
  use).</p>

  <p>Macros defined by mixing Vi and Emacs commands are represented
  as vectors. So, don&rsquo;t be confused when you see one (usually
  through the history of Ex commands). For instance, if
  <kbd>gg</kbd> is defined by typing <kbd>l</kbd>, the up-arrow key
  and <kbd>M-x next-line</kbd>, its definition will look as follows
  in Emacs:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
[l up (meta x) n e x t - l i n e return]
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Second, Viper macros are defined in a WYSIWYG style. This
  means that commands are executed as you type them, so you can see
  precisely what is being defined. Third, macros can be bound to
  arbitrary sequences of keys, not just to printable keys. For
  instance, one can define a macro that will be invoked by hitting
  <kbd>f3</kbd> then <kbd>f2</kbd> function keys. (The keys
  <kbd>delete</kbd> and <kbd>backspace</kbd> are excluded; also, a
  macro invocation sequence can&rsquo;t start with <tt class=
  "key">ESC</tt>. Some other keys, such as <kbd>f1</kbd> and
  <kbd>help</kbd>, can&rsquo;t be bound to macros under Emacs,
  since they are bound in <code>key-translation-map</code>, which
  overrides any other binding the user gives to keys. In general,
  keys that have a binding in <code>key-translation-map</code>
  can&rsquo;t be bound to a macro.)</p>

  <p>Fourth, in Viper, one can define macros that are specific to a
  given buffer, a given major mode, or macros that are defined for
  all buffers. In fact, the same macro name can have several
  different definitions: one global, several definitions for
  various major modes, and definitions for various specific
  buffers. Buffer-specific definitions override mode-specific
  definitions, which, in turn, override global definitions.</p>

  <p>As if all that is not enough, Viper (through its interface to
  Emacs macros) lets the user define keyboard macros that ask for
  confirmation or even prompt the user for input and then continue.
  To do this, one should type <kbd>C-x q</kbd> (for confirmation)
  or <kbd>C-u C-x q</kbd> (for prompt). For details, see <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macro-Query.html#Keyboard-Macro-Query">
  Customization</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>.</p>

  <p>When the user finishes defining a macro (which is done by
  typing <kbd>C-x)</kbd>, a departure from Vi), you will be asked
  whether you want this macro to be global, mode-specific, or
  buffer-specific. You will also be given a chance to save the
  macro in your Viper customization file. This is the easiest way
  to save a macro and make it permanently available. If you work
  your startup files with bare hands, here is how Viper saves the
  above macro so that it will be available in Viper&rsquo;s Insert
  state (and Replace state) in buffer <code>my-buf</code> only:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(viper-record-kbd-macro "gg" 'insert-state
       [l up (meta x) n e x t - l i n e return]
       "my-buf")
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>To do the same for Vi state and all buffers with the major
  mode <code>cc-mode</code>, use:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(viper-record-kbd-macro "gg" 'vi-state
       [l up (meta x) n e x t - l i n e return]
       'cc-mode)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Both macro names and macro definitions are vectors of symbols
  that denote keys on the keyboard. Some keys, like <kbd>\</kbd>, ,
  or digit-keys must be escaped with a backslash. Modified keys are
  represented as lists. For instance, holding Meta and Control and
  pressing <kbd>f4</kbd> is represented as <kbd>(control meta
  f4)</kbd>. If all members of a vectors are printable characters
  (or sequences, such as <kbd>\e</kbd>, <kbd>\t</kbd>, for
  <tt class="key">ESC</tt> and <tt class="key">TAB</tt>), then they
  can also be represented as strings:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(viper-record-kbd-macro "aa" 'vi-state  "aaa\e"  "my-buffer")
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Thus, typing <kbd>aa</kbd> fast in Vi state will switch Viper
  to Insert state (due to the first <kbd>a</kbd>), insert
  <kbd>aa</kbd>, and then it will switch back to Vi state. All this
  will take effect only in the buffer named
  <code>my-buffer</code>.</p>

  <p>Note that the last argument to
  <code>viper-record-kbd-macro</code> must be either a string (a
  buffer name), a symbol representing a major mode, or
  <code>t</code>; the latter says that the macro is to be defined
  for all buffers (which is how macros are defined in original
  Vi).</p>

  <p>For convenience, Viper also lets you define Vi-style macros in
  its Emacs state. There is no Ex command, like <kbd>:map</kbd> and
  <kbd>:map!</kbd> for doing this, but the user can include such a
  macro in the Viper customization file. The only thing is that the
  <code>viper-record-kbd-macro</code> command should specify
  <code>emacs-state</code> instead of <code>vi-state</code> or
  <code>insert-state</code>.</p>

  <p>The user can get rid of a macro either by using the Ex
  commands <kbd>:unmap</kbd> and <kbd>:unmap!</kbd> or by issuing a
  call to <code>viper-unrecord-kbd-macro</code>. The latter is more
  powerful, since it can delete macros even in
  <code>emacs-state</code>. However,
  <code>viper-unrecord-kbd-macro</code> is usually needed only when
  the user needs to get rid of the macros that are already
  predefined in Viper. The syntax is: <a name=
  "index-viper_002dunrecord_002dkbd_002dmacro" id=
  "index-viper_002dunrecord_002dkbd_002dmacro"></a></p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(viper-unrecord-kbd-macro macro state)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The second argument must be <code>vi-state</code>,
  <code>insert-state</code>, or <code>emacs-state</code>. The first
  argument is a name of a macro. To avoid mistakes in specifying
  names of existing macros, type <kbd>M-x
  viper-describe-kbd-macros</kbd> and use a name from the list
  displayed by this command.</p>

  <p>If an error occurs during macro definition, Emacs aborts the
  process, and it must be repeated. This is analogous to Vi, except
  that in Vi the user doesn&rsquo;t know there is an error until
  the macro is actually run. All that means that in order for a
  definition to be successful, the user must do some simple
  planning of the process in advance, to avoid errors. For
  instance, if you want to map <kbd>gg</kbd> to <kbd>llll</kbd> in
  Vi state, you must make sure that there is enough room on the
  current line. Since <kbd>l</kbd> moves the cursor forward, it may
  signal an error on reaching the end of line, which will abort the
  definition.</p>

  <p>These precautions are necessary only when defining macros;
  they will help avoid the need to redo the job. When macros are
  actually run, an error during the execution will simply terminate
  the current execution (but the macro will remain mapped).</p>

  <p>A macro name can be a string of characters or a vector of
  keys. The latter makes it possible to define macros bound to,
  say, double-hits on a function key, such as <kbd>up</kbd> or
  <kbd>f13</kbd>. This is very useful if you run out of function
  keys on your keyboard; it makes Viper macro facility a
  <em>keyboard doubler</em>, so to speak.</p>

  <p>Elsewhere (See <a href="Key-Bindings.html#Key-Bindings">Key
  Bindings</a>, for details), we review the standard Emacs
  mechanism for binding function keys to commands. For
  instance,</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(global-set-key [f13] 'repeat-complex-command)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>binds the key f13 to the Emacs function that repeats the last
  minibuffer command. Under Viper, however, you may still use this
  key for additional purposes, if you bind, say, a double-hitting
  action for that key to some other function. Emacs doesn&rsquo;t
  allow the user to do that, but Viper does this through its
  keyboard macro facility. To do this, type <kbd>:map</kbd> first.
  When you are asked to enter a macro name, hit f13 twice, followed
  by <tt class="key">RET</tt> or <tt class="key">SPC</tt>.</p>

  <p>Emacs will now start the mapping process by actually executing
  Vi and Emacs commands, so that you could see what will happen
  each time the macro is executed. Suppose now we wanted to bind
  the key sequence <kbd>f13 f13</kbd> to the command
  <code>eval-last-sexp</code>. To accomplish this, we can type
  <kbd>M-x eval-last-sexp</kbd> followed by <kbd>C-x )</kbd>. If
  you answer positively to Viper&rsquo;s offer to save this macro
  in your Viper customization file for future uses, the following
  will be inserted in that file:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(viper-record-kbd-macro [f16 f16] 'vi-state
         [(meta x) e v a l - l a s t - s e x p]
         'lisp-interaction-mode)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>To illustrate the above point, Viper provides two canned
  macros, which, by default, are bound to <kbd>[f12 \1]</kbd> and
  <kbd>[f12 \2]</kbd> (invoked by typing <kbd>f12</kbd> then
  <kbd>1</kbd> and <kbd>2</kbd>, respectively). These macros are
  useful shortcuts to Viper&rsquo;s command ring history. The first
  macro will execute the second-last destructive command (the last
  one is executed by <kbd>.</kbd>, as usual). The second macro
  executes the third-last command.</p>

  <p>If you need to go deeper into the command history, you will
  have to use other commands, as described earlier in this section;
  or you can bind, say, <kbd>f12 \3</kbd> like this:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(viper-record-kbd-macro [f12 \3] 'vi-state
                      [(meta x) r e p e a t - f r o m - h i s t o r y]
                      t)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Note that even though the macro uses the function key
  <kbd>f12</kbd>, the key is actually free and can still be bound
  to some Emacs function via <code>define-key</code> or
  <code>global-set-key</code>.</p>

  <p>Viper allows the user to define macro names that are prefixes
  of other macros. For instance, one can define <kbd>[[</kbd> and
  <kbd>[[[[</kbd> to be macros. If you type the exact sequence of
  such keys and then pause, Viper will execute the right macro.
  However, if you don&rsquo;t pause and, say, type
  <kbd>[[[[text</kbd> then the conflict is resolved as follows. If
  only one of the key sequences, <kbd>[[</kbd> or <kbd>[[[[</kbd>
  has a definition applicable to the current buffer, then, in fact,
  there is no conflict and the right macro will be chosen. If both
  have applicable definitions, then the first one found will be
  executed. Usually this is the macro with a shorter name. So, in
  our case, <kbd>[[[[text</kbd> will cause the macro <kbd>[[</kbd>
  to be executed twice and then the remaining keys, <kbd>t e x
  t</kbd>, will be processed.</p>

  <p>When defining macros using <kbd>:map</kbd> or
  <kbd>:map!</kbd>, the user enters the actually keys to be used to
  invoke the macro. For instance, you should hit the actual key
  <kbd>f6</kbd> if it is to be part of a macro name; you do
  <em>not</em> write <kbd>f 6</kbd>. When entering keys, Viper
  displays them as strings or vectors (e.g., <code>"abc"</code> or
  <code>[f6 f7 a]</code>). The same holds for unmapping. Hitting
  <tt class="key">TAB</tt> while typing a macro name in the
  <kbd>:unmap</kbd> or <kbd>:unmap!</kbd> command will cause name
  completion. Completions are displayed as strings or vectors.
  However, as before, you don&rsquo;t actually type
  &lsquo;<samp>"</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>[</samp>&rsquo;, or
  &lsquo;<samp>]</samp>&rsquo; that appear in the completions.
  These are meta-symbols that indicate whether the corresponding
  macro name is a vector or a string.</p>

  <p>One last difference from Vi: Vi-style keyboard macros cannot
  be defined in terms of other Vi-style keyboard macros (but named
  Emacs macros are OK). More precisely, while defining or executing
  a macro, the special meaning of key sequences (as Vi macros) is
  ignored. This is because it is all too easy to create an infinite
  loop in this way. Since Viper macros are much more powerful than
  Vi&rsquo;s it is impossible to detect such loops. In practice,
  this is not really a limitation but, rather, a feature.</p>

  <p>We should also note that Vi macros are disabled in the
  minibuffer, which helps keep some potential troubles away.</p>

  <p>The rate at which the user must type keys in order for them to
  be recognized as a timeout macro is controlled by the variable
  <code>viper-fast-keyseq-timeout</code>, which defaults to 200
  milliseconds.</p>

  <p>For the most part, Viper macros defined in the Viper
  customization file can be shared between X and TTY modes. The
  problem with TTY may be that the function keys there generate
  sequences of events instead of a single event (as under a window
  system). Emacs maps some of these sequences back to the logical
  keys (e.g., the sequences generated by the arrow keys are mapped
  to <kbd>up</kbd>, <kbd>left</kbd>, etc.). However, not all
  function keys are mapped in this way. Macros that are bound to
  key sequences that contain such unmapped function keys have to be
  redefined for TTY&rsquo;s (and possibly for every type of TTY you
  may be using). To do this, start Emacs on an appropriate TTY
  device and define the macro using <kbd>:map</kbd>, as
  usual.</p><a name="index-viper_002ddescribe_002dkbd_002dmacros"
  id="index-viper_002ddescribe_002dkbd_002dmacros"></a>

  <p>Finally, Viper provides a function that conveniently displays
  all macros currently defined. To see all macros along with their
  definitions, type <kbd>M-x viper-describe-kbd-macros</kbd>.</p>
