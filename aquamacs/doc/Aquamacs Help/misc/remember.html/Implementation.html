  <h2 class="chapter">3 Implementation</h2>

  <p>Hyperbole, as a data presentation tool, always struck me as
  being very powerful, but it seemed to require a lot of
  &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; work before that data was really
  available. The problem with BBDB, or keeping up a Bibl-mode file,
  is that you have to use different functions to record the data,
  and it always takes time to stop what you&rsquo;re doing, format
  the data in the manner expected by that particular data
  interface, and then resume your work.</p>

  <p>With &ldquo;remember&rdquo;, you just hit <kbd>M-x
  remember</kbd> (you&rsquo;d probably want to bind this to an
  easily accessible keystroke, like <kbd>C-x M-r</kbd>), slam in
  your text however you like, and then hit <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>. It
  will file the data away for later retrieval, and possibly
  indexing.</p>

  <p>Indexing is to data what &ldquo;studying&rdquo; is in the real
  world. What you do when you study (or lucubrate, for some of us)
  is to realize certain relationships implicit in the data, so that
  you can make use of those relationships. Expressing that a
  certain quote you remembered was a literary quote, and that you
  want the ability to pull up all quotes of a literary nature, is
  what studying does. This is a more labor intensive task than the
  original remembering of the data, and it&rsquo;s typical in real
  life to set aside a special period of time for doing this
  work.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember&rdquo; works in the same way. When you enter
  data, either by typing it into a buffer, or using the contents of
  the selected region, it will store that data&mdash;unindexed,
  uninterpreted&mdash;in a data pool. It will also try to remember
  as much context information as possible (any text properties that
  were set, where you copied it from, when, how, etc.). Later, you
  can walk through your accumulated set of data (both organized,
  and unorganized) and easily begin moving things around, and
  making annotations that will express the full meaning of that
  data, as far as you know it.</p>

  <p>Obviously this latter stage is more user-interface intensive,
  and it would be nice if &ldquo;remember&rdquo; could do it as
  elegantly as possible, rather than requiring a billion keystrokes
  to reorganize your hierarchy. Well, as the future arrives,
  hopefully experience and user feedback will help to make this as
  intuitive a tool as possible.</p>
