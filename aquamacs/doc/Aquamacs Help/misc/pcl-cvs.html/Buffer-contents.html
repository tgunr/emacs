  <p>The display contains several columns, some of which are
  optional. These columns are, from left to right:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Optionally, the head revision of the file. This is the
    latest version found in the repository. It might also contain
    (instead of the head revision) a sub status which typically
    gives further information about how we got to the current
    state, for example &lsquo;<samp>patched</samp>&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;<samp>merged</samp>&rsquo;, &hellip;</li>

    <li>An asterisk when the file is <em>marked</em> (see <a href=
    "Selected-files.html#Selected-files">Selected files</a>).</li>

    <li>The actual status of the file wrt the repository. See
    below.</li>

    <li>Optionally, the base revision of the file. This is the
    version which the copy in your working directory is based
    upon.</li>

    <li>The file name.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The &lsquo;<samp>file status</samp>&rsquo; field can have the
  following values:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>Modified</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The file is modified in your working directory, and there
      was no modification to the same file in the repository. This
      status can have the following substatus:</p>

      <dl compact="compact">
        <dt>&lsquo;<samp>merged</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The file was modified in your working directory, and
          there were modifications in the repository as well, but
          they were merged successfully, without conflict, in your
          working directory.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>Conflict</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes
      to <var>file</var> with changes from the repository.
      <var>file</var> (the copy in your working directory) is now
      the output of the <code>rcsmerge</code> command on the two
      versions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your
      working directory, with the name
      <samp>.#<var>file</var>.<var>version</var></samp>, where
      <var>version</var> is the RCS revision that your modified
      file started from. See <a href=
      "Viewing-differences.html#Viewing-differences">Viewing
      differences</a>, for more details.</p>

      <p>A conflict can also come from a disagreement on the
      existence of the file rather than on its content. This case
      is indicated by the following possible substatus:</p>

      <dl compact="compact">
        <dt>&lsquo;<samp>removed</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The file is locally removed but a new revision has
          been committed to the repository by someone else.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp>added</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The file is locally added and has also been added to
          the repository by someone else.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp>modified</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The file is locally modified but someone else has
          removed it from the repository.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>Added</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The file has been added by you, but it still needs to be
      checked in to the repository.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>Removed</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The file has been removed by you, but it still needs to be
      checked in to the repository. You can resurrect it by typing
      <kbd>a</kbd> (see <a href=
      "Adding-and-removing-files.html#Adding-and-removing-files">Adding
      and removing files</a>).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>Unknown</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A file that was detected in your directory, but that
      neither appears in the repository, nor is present on the list
      of files that CVS should ignore.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>Up-to-date</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The file is up to date with respect to the version in the
      repository. This status can have a substatus of:</p>

      <dl compact="compact">
        <dt>&lsquo;<samp>added</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>You have just added the file to the repository.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp>updated</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The file was brought up to date with respect to the
          repository. This is done for any file that exists in the
          repository but not in your source, and for files that you
          haven&rsquo;t changed but are not the most recent
          versions available in the repository.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp>patched</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The file was brought up to date with respect to the
          remote repository by way of fetching and applying a patch
          to the file in your source. This is equivalent to
          &lsquo;<samp>updated</samp>&rsquo; except that CVS
          decided to use a hopefully more efficient method.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp>committed</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>You just committed the file.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>Need-Update</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Either a newer version than the one in your source is
      available in the repository and you have not modified your
      checked out version, or the file exists in the repository but
      not in your source. Use
      &lsquo;<samp>cvs-mode-update</samp>&rsquo; bound to
      <kbd>O</kbd> to update the file.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>Need-Merge</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>You have modified the checked out version of the file, and
      a newer version is available in the repository. A merge will
      take place when you run a
      &lsquo;<samp>cvs-update</samp>&rsquo;.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>Missing</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The file has been unexpectedly removed from your working
      directory although it has not been &lsquo;<samp>cvs
      remove</samp>&rsquo;d.</p>
    </dd>
