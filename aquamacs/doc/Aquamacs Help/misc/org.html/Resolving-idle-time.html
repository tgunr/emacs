  <h4 class="subsection">8.4.3 Resolving idle time and continuous
  clocking</h4><a name="Resolving-idle-time-1" id=
  "Resolving-idle-time-1"></a>

  <h4 class="subsubheading">Resolving idle time</h4><a name=
  "index-resolve-idle-time" id="index-resolve-idle-time"></a>
  <a name="index-org_002dclock_002dx11idle_002dprogram_002dname"

  <p>If you clock in on a work item, and then walk away from your
  computer&mdash;perhaps to take a phone call&mdash;you often need
  to &ldquo;resolve&rdquo; the time you were away by either
  subtracting it from the current clock, or applying it to another
  one.</p><a name="index-org_002dclock_002didle_002dtime" id=
  "index-org_002dclock_002didle_002dtime"></a>

  <p>By customizing the variable <code>org-clock-idle-time</code>
  to some integer, such as 10 or 15, Emacs can alert you when you
  get back to your computer after being idle for that many
  minutes<a name="DOCF87" href="#FOOT87" id=
  "DOCF87"><sup>87</sup></a>, and ask what you want to do with the
  idle time. There will be a question waiting for you when you get
  back, indicating how much idle time has passed (constantly
  updated with the current amount), as well as a set of choices to
  correct the discrepancy:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt><kbd>k</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>To keep some or all of the minutes and stay clocked in,
      press <kbd>k</kbd>. Org will ask how many of the minutes to
      keep. Press <tt class="key">RET</tt> to keep them all,
      effectively changing nothing, or enter a number to keep that
      many minutes.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>K</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>If you use the shift key and press <kbd>K</kbd>, it will
      keep however many minutes you request and then immediately
      clock out of that task. If you keep all of the minutes, this
      is the same as just clocking out of the current task.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>s</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>To keep none of the minutes, use <kbd>s</kbd> to subtract
      all the away time from the clock, and then check back in from
      the moment you returned.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>S</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>To keep none of the minutes and just clock out at the
      start of the away time, use the shift key and press
      <kbd>S</kbd>. Remember that using shift will always leave you
      clocked out, no matter which option you choose.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>C</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>To cancel the clock altogether, use <kbd>C</kbd>. Note
      that if instead of canceling you subtract the away time, and
      the resulting clock amount is less than a minute, the clock
      will still be canceled rather than clutter up the log with an
      empty entry.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>What if you subtracted those away minutes from the current
  clock, and now want to apply them to a new clock? Simply clock in
  to any task immediately after the subtraction. Org will notice
  that you have subtracted time &ldquo;on the books&rdquo;, so to
  speak, and will ask if you want to apply those minutes to the
  next task you clock in on.</p>

  <p>There is one other instance when this clock resolution magic
  occurs. Say you were clocked in and hacking away, and suddenly
  your cat chased a mouse who scared a hamster that crashed into
  your UPS&rsquo;s power button! You suddenly lose all your
  buffers, but thanks to auto-save you still have your recent Org
  mode changes, including your last clock in.</p>

  <p>If you restart Emacs and clock into any task, Org will notice
  that you have a dangling clock which was never clocked out from
  your last session. Using that clock&rsquo;s starting time as the
  beginning of the unaccounted-for period, Org will ask how you
  want to resolve that time. The logic and behavior is identical to
  dealing with away time due to idleness; it is just happening due
  to a recovery event rather than a set amount of idle time.</p>

  <p>You can also check all the files visited by your Org agenda
  for dangling clocks at any time using <kbd>M-x org-resolve-clocks
  RET</kbd> (or <kbd>C-c C-x C-z</kbd>).</p><a name=
  "Continuous-clocking" id="Continuous-clocking"></a>

  <h4 class="subsubheading">Continuous clocking</h4><a name=
  "index-continuous-clocking" id="index-continuous-clocking"></a>
  <a name="index-org_002dclock_002dcontinuously-2" id=
  "index-org_002dclock_002dcontinuously-2"></a>

  <p>You may want to start clocking from the time when you clocked
  out the previous task. To enable this systematically, set
  <code>org-clock-continuously</code> to <code>t</code>. Each time
  you clock in, Org retrieves the clock-out time of the last
  clocked entry for this session, and start the new clock from
  there.</p>

  <p>If you only want this from time to time, use three universal
  prefix arguments with <code>org-clock-in</code> and two <kbd>C-u
  C-u</kbd> with <code>org-clock-in-last</code>.</p>

    <h3><a name="FOOT87" href="#DOCF87" id="FOOT87">(87)</a></h3>

    <p>On computers using Mac OS X, idleness is based on actual
    user idleness, not just Emacs&rsquo; idle time. For X11, you
    can install a utility program <samp>x11idle.c</samp>, available
    in the <code>contrib/scripts</code> directory of the Org git
    distribution, or install the <samp>xprintidle</samp> package
    and set it to the variable
    <code>org-clock-x11idle-program-name</code> if you are running
    Debian, to get the same general treatment of idleness. On other
    systems, idle time refers to Emacs idle time only.</p>
