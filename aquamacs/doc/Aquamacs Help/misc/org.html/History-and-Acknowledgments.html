  <h3 class="section">C.1 From Carsten</h3>

  <p>Org was born in 2003, out of frustration over the user
  interface of the Emacs Outline mode. I was trying to organize my
  notes and projects, and using Emacs seemed to be the natural way
  to go. However, having to remember eleven different commands with
  two or three keys per command, only to hide and show parts of the
  outline tree, that seemed entirely unacceptable to me. Also, when
  using outlines to take notes, I constantly wanted to restructure
  the tree, organizing it parallel to my thoughts and plans.
  <em>Visibility cycling</em> and <em>structure editing</em> were
  originally implemented in the package
  <samp>outline-magic.el</samp>, but quickly moved to the more
  general <samp>org.el</samp>. As this environment became
  comfortable for project planning, the next step was adding
  <em>TODO entries</em>, basic <em>timestamps</em>, and <em>table
  support</em>. These areas highlighted the two main goals that Org
  still has today: to be a new, outline-based, plain text mode with
  innovative and intuitive editing features, and to incorporate
  project planning functionality directly into a notes file.</p>

  <p>Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me
  or to <a href=
  "mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org">emacs-orgmode@gnu.org</a> have
  provided a constant stream of bug reports, feedback, new ideas,
  and sometimes patches and add-on code. Many thanks to everyone
  who has helped to improve this package. I am trying to keep here
  a list of the people who had significant influence in shaping one
  or more aspects of Org. The list may not be complete, if I have
  forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and let me
  know.</p>

  <p>Before I get to this list, a few special mentions are in
  order:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt class="c1">Bastien Guerry</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Bastien has written a large number of extensions to Org
      (most of them integrated into the core by now), including the
      LaTeX exporter and the plain list parser. His support during
      the early days, when he basically acted as co-maintainer, was
      central to the success of this project. Bastien also invented
      Worg, helped establishing the Web presence of Org, and
      sponsored hosting costs for the orgmode.org website.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="c1">Eric Schulte and Dan Davison</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Eric and Dan are jointly responsible for the Org-babel
      system, which turns Org into a multi-language environment for
      evaluating code and doing literate programming and
      reproducible research.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="c1">John Wiegley</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>John has contributed a number of great ideas and patches
      directly to Org, including the attachment system
      (<samp>org-attach.el</samp>), integration with Apple Mail
      (<samp>org-mac-message.el</samp>), hierarchical dependencies
      of TODO items, habit tracking (<samp>org-habits.el</samp>),
      and encryption (<samp>org-crypt.el</samp>). Also, the capture
      system is really an extended copy of his great
      <samp>remember.el</samp>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="c1">Sebastian Rose</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Without Sebastian, the HTML/XHTML publishing of Org would
      be the pitiful work of an ignorant amateur. Sebastian has
      pushed this part of Org onto a much higher level. He also
      wrote <samp>org-info.js</samp>, a Java script for displaying
      web pages derived from Org using an Info-like or a folding
      interface with single-key navigation.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>See below for the full list of contributions! Again, please
  let me know what I am missing here!</p><a name="From-Bastien" id=
  "From-Bastien"></a>

  <h3 class="section">C.2 From Bastien</h3>

  <p>I (Bastien) have been maintaining Org since January 2011. This
  appendix would not be complete without adding a few more
  acknowledgements and thanks to Carsten&rsquo;s ones above.</p>

  <p>I am first grateful to Carsten for his trust while handing me
  over the maintainership of Org. His unremitting support is what
  really helped me getting more confident over time, with both the
  community and the code.</p>

  <p>When I took over maintainership, I knew I would have to make
  Org more collaborative than ever, as I would have to rely on
  people that are more knowledgeable than I am on many parts of the
  code. Here is a list of the persons I could rely on, they should
  really be considered co-maintainers, either of the code or the
  community:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt class="c1">Eric Schulte</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Eric is maintaining the Babel parts of Org. His reactivity
      here kept me away from worrying about possible bugs here and
      let me focus on other parts.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="c1">Nicolas Goaziou</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Nicolas is maintaining the consistency of the deepest
      parts of Org. His work on <samp>org-element.el</samp> and
      <samp>ox.el</samp> has been outstanding, and opened the doors
      for many new ideas and features. He rewrote many of the old
      exporters to use the new export engine, and helped with
      documenting this major change. More importantly (if
      that&rsquo;s possible), he has been more than reliable during
      all the work done for Org 8.0, and always very reactive on
      the mailing list.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="c1">Achim Gratz</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Achim rewrote the building process of Org, turning some
      <em>ad hoc</em> tools into a flexible and conceptually clean
      process. He patiently coped with the many hiccups that such a
      change can create for users.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="c1">Nick Dokos</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The Org mode mailing list would not be such a nice place
      without Nick, who patiently helped users so many times. It is
      impossible to overestimate such a great help, and the list
      would not be so active without him.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>I received support from so many users that it is clearly
  impossible to be fair when shortlisting a few of them, but
  Org&rsquo;s history would not be complete if the ones above were
  not mentioned in this manual.</p><a name="List-of-contributions"

    mode manual as a book.</li>
