  <h3 class="section">3.2 Expected Failures</h3>

  <p>Some bugs are complicated to fix, or not very important, and
  are left as <em>known bugs</em>. If there is a test case that
  triggers the bug and fails, ERT will alert you of this failure
  every time you run all tests. For known bugs, this alert is a
  distraction. The way to suppress it is to add
  <code>:expected-result :failed</code> to the test definition:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(ert-deftest future-bug ()
  "Test `time-forward' with negative arguments.
Since this functionality isn't implemented, the test is known to fail."
  :expected-result :failed
  (time-forward -1))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>ERT will still display a small <code>f</code> in the progress
  bar as a reminder that there is a known bug, and will count the
  test as failed, but it will be quiet about it otherwise.</p>

  <p>An alternative to marking the test as a known failure this way
  is to delete the test. This is a good idea if there is no intent
  to fix it, i.e., if the behavior that was formerly considered a
  bug has become an accepted feature.</p>

  <p>In general, however, it can be useful to keep tests that are
  known to fail. If someone wants to fix the bug, they will have a
  very good starting point: an automated test case that reproduces
  the bug. This makes it much easier to fix the bug, demonstrate
  that it is fixed, and prevent future regressions.</p>

  <p>ERT displays the same kind of alerts for tests that pass
  unexpectedly as it displays for unexpected failures. This way, if
  you make code changes that happen to fix a bug that you
  weren&rsquo;t aware of, you will know to remove the
  <code>:expected-result</code> clause of that test and close the
  corresponding bug report, if any.</p>

  <p>Since <code>:expected-result</code> evaluates its argument
  when the test is loaded, tests can be marked as known failures
  only on certain Emacs versions, specific architectures, etc.:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(ert-deftest foo ()
  "A test that is expected to fail on Emacs 23 but succeed elsewhere."
  :expected-result (if (string-match "GNU Emacs 23[.]" (emacs-version))
                       :failed
                     :passed)
  ...)
</pre>
