  <h3 class="section">3.3 Tests and Their Environment</h3>

  <p>Sometimes, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to run a test due to
  missing preconditions. A required Emacs feature might not be
  compiled in, the function to be tested could call an external
  binary which might not be available on the test machine, you name
  it. In this case, the macro <code>skip-unless</code> could be
  used to skip the test:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(ert-deftest test-dbus ()
  "A test that checks D-BUS functionality."
  (skip-unless (featurep 'dbusbind))
  ...)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The outcome of running a test should not depend on the current
  state of the environment, and each test should leave its
  environment in the same state it found it in. In particular, a
  test should not depend on any Emacs customization variables or
  hooks, and if it has to make any changes to Emacs&rsquo;s state
  or state external to Emacs (such as the file system), it should
  undo these changes before it returns, regardless of whether it
  passed or failed.</p>

  <p>Tests should not depend on the environment because any such
  dependencies can make the test brittle or lead to failures that
  occur only under certain circumstances and are hard to reproduce.
  Of course, the code under test may have settings that affect its
  behavior. In that case, it is best to make the test
  <code>let</code>-bind all such setting variables to set up a
  specific configuration for the duration of the test. The test can
  also set up a number of different configurations and run the code
  under test with each.</p>

  <p>Tests that have side effects on their environment should
  restore it to its original state because any side effects that
  persist after the test can disrupt the workflow of the programmer
  running the tests. If the code under test has side effects on
  Emacs&rsquo;s current state, such as on the current buffer or
  window configuration, the test should create a temporary buffer
  for the code to manipulate (using <code>with-temp-buffer</code>),
  or save and restore the window configuration (using
  <code>save-window-excursion</code>), respectively. For aspects of
  the state that can not be preserved with such macros, cleanup
  should be performed with <code>unwind-protect</code>, to ensure
  that the cleanup occurs even if the test fails.</p>

  <p>An exception to this are messages that the code under test
  prints with <code>message</code> and similar logging; tests
  should not bother restoring the <samp>*Message*</samp> buffer to
  its original state.</p>

  <p>The above guidelines imply that tests should avoid calling
  highly customizable commands such as <code>find-file</code>,
  except, of course, if such commands are what they want to test.
  The exact behavior of <code>find-file</code> depends on many
  settings such as <code>find-file-wildcards</code>,
  <code>enable-local-variables</code>, and
  <code>auto-mode-alist</code>. It is difficult to write a
  meaningful test if its behavior can be affected by so many
  external factors. Also, <code>find-file</code> has side effects
  that are hard to predict and thus hard to undo: It may create a
  new buffer or reuse an existing buffer if one is already visiting
  the requested file; and it runs <code>find-file-hook</code>,
  which can have arbitrary side effects.</p>

  <p>Instead, it is better to use lower-level mechanisms with
  simple and predictable semantics like
  <code>with-temp-buffer</code>, <code>insert</code> or
  <code>insert-file-contents-literally</code>, and to activate any
  desired mode by calling the corresponding function directly,
  after binding the hook variables to <code>nil</code>. This avoids
  the above problems.</p>
