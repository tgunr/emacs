  <p>Eshell is a <em>command shell</em> written in Emacs Lisp.
  Everything it does, it uses Emacs&rsquo;s facilities to do. This
  means that Eshell is as portable as Emacs itself. It also means
  that cooperation with Lisp code is natural and seamless.</p>

  <p>What is a command shell? To properly understand the role of a
  shell, it&rsquo;s necessary to visualize what a computer does for
  you. Basically, a computer is a tool; in order to use that tool,
  you must tell it what to do&mdash;or give it
  &ldquo;commands.&rdquo; These commands take many forms, such as
  clicking with a mouse on certain parts of the screen. But that is
  only one form of command input.</p>

  <p>By far the most versatile way to express what you want the
  computer to do is by using an abbreviated language called
  <em>script</em>. In script, instead of telling the computer,
  &ldquo;list my files, please&rdquo;, one writes a standard
  abbreviated command word&mdash;&lsquo;<samp>ls</samp>&rsquo;.
  Typing &lsquo;<samp>ls</samp>&rsquo; in a command shell is a
  script way of telling the computer to list your files.<a name=
  "DOCF1" href="#FOOT1" id="DOCF1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

  <p>The real flexibility of this approach is apparent only when
  you realize that there are many, many different ways to list
  files. Perhaps you want them sorted by name, sorted by date, in
  reverse order, or grouped by type. Most graphical browsers have
  simple ways to express this. But what about showing only a few
  files, or only files that meet a certain criteria? In very
  complex and specific situations, the request becomes too
  difficult to express using a mouse or pointing device. It is just
  these kinds of requests that are easily solved using a command
  shell.</p>

  <p>For example, what if you want to list every Word file on your
  hard drive, larger than 100 kilobytes in size, and which
  hasn&rsquo;t been looked at in over six months? That is a good
  candidate list for deletion, when you go to clean up your hard
  drive. But have you ever tried asking your computer for such a
  list? There is no way to do it! At least, not without using a
  command shell.</p>

  <p>The role of a command shell is to give you more control over
  what your computer does for you. Not everyone needs this amount
  of control, and it does come at a cost: Learning the necessary
  script commands to express what you want done. A complicated
  query, such as the example above, takes time to learn. But if you
  find yourself using your computer frequently enough, it is more
  than worthwhile in the long run. Any tool you use often deserves
  the time spent learning to master it. <a name="DOCF2" href=

  <p>Eshell is <em>not</em> a replacement for system shells such as
  <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>. Use Eshell when you want
  to move text between Emacs and external processes; if you only
  want to pipe output from one external process to another (and
  then another, and so on), use a system shell, because
  Emacs&rsquo;s IO system is buffer oriented, not stream oriented,
  and is very inefficient at such tasks. If you want to write shell
  scripts in Eshell, don&rsquo;t; either write an elisp library or
  use a system shell.</p>

  <p>Some things Eshell just doesn&rsquo;t do well. It fills the
  niche between IELM and your system shell, where the peculiar
  use-cases lie, and it is less than ideal outside that niche.</p>

    <p>For the understandably curious, here is what that command
