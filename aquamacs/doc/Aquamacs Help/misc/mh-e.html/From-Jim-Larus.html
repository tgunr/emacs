  <p>Brian Reid, while at CMU or shortly after going to Stanford
  wrote a mail reading program called MHE for Gosling Emacs. It had
  much the same structure as MH-E (i.e., invoked MH programs),
  though it was simpler and the commands were slightly different.
  Unfortunately, I no longer have a copy so the differences are
  lost in the mists of time.</p>

  <p>In &rsquo;82&ndash;83, I was working at BBN and wrote a lot of
  mlisp code in Gosling Emacs to make it look more like Tennex
  Emacs. One of the packages that I picked up and improved was
  Reid&rsquo;s mail system. In &rsquo;83, I went back to Berkeley.
  About that time, Stallman&rsquo;s first version of GNU Emacs came
  out and people started to move to it from Gosling Emacs (as I
  recall, the transition took a year or two). I decided to port
  Reid&rsquo;s MHE and used the mlisp to Emacs Lisp translator that
  came with GNU Emacs. It did a lousy job and the resulting code
  didn&rsquo;t work, so I bit the bullet and rewrote the code by
  hand (it was a lot smaller and simpler then, so it took only a
  day or two).</p>

  <p>Soon after that, MH-E became part of the standard Emacs
  distribution and suggestions kept dribbling in for improvements.
  MH-E soon reached sufficient functionality to keep me happy, but
  I kept on improving it because I was a graduate student with
  plenty of time on my hands and it was more fun than my
  dissertation. In retrospect, the one thing that I regret is not
  writing any documentation, which seriously limited the use and
  appeal of the package.</p><a name=

  <p>In &rsquo;89, I came to Wisconsin as a professor and decided
  not to work on MH-E. It was stable, except for minor bugs, and
  had enough functionality, so I let it be for a few years. Stephen
  Gildea of BBN began to pester me about the bugs, but I ignored
  them. In 1990, he went off to the X Consortium, said good bye,
  and said that he would now be using <code>xmh</code>. A few
  months later, he came back and said that he couldn&rsquo;t stand
  <code>xmh</code> and could I put a few more bug fixes into MH-E.
  At that point, I had no interest in fixing MH-E, so I gave the
  responsibility of maintenance to him and he has done a fine job
  since then.</p>
