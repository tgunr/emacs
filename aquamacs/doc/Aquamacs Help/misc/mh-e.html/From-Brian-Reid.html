  <p>One day in 1983 I got the flu and had to stay home from work
  for three days with nothing to do. I used that time to write MHE.
  The fundamental idea behind MHE was that it was a
  &ldquo;puppeteer&rdquo; driving the MH programs underneath it. MH
  had a model that the editor was supposed to run as a sub-process
  of the mailer, which seemed to me at the time to be the tail
  wagging the dog. So I turned it around and made the editor drive
  the MH programs. I made sure that the UCI people (who were
  maintaining MH at the time) took in my changes and made them
  stick.</p>

  <p>Today, I still use my own version of MHE because I don&rsquo;t
  at all like the way that GNU MH-E works and I&rsquo;ve never
  gotten to be good enough at hacking Emacs Lisp to make GNU MH-E
  do what I want. The Gosling-emacs version of MHE and the GNU
  Emacs version of MH-E have almost nothing in common except
  similar names. They work differently, have different conceptual
  models, and have different key bindings<a name="DOCF60" href=

    <p>After reading this article, I questioned Brian about his
    version of MHE, and received some great ideas for improving
    MH-E such as a dired-like method of selecting folders; and
    removing the prompting when sending mail, filling in the blanks
    in the draft buffer instead. I passed them on to Stephen
    Gildea, the current maintainer, and he was excited about the
    ideas as well. Perhaps one day, MH-E will again resemble MHE
    (draft form editing was introduced in version 7.4).</p>
