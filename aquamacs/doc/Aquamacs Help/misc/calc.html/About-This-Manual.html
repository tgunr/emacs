  <h3 class="section">1.2 About This Manual</h3>

  <p>This document serves as a complete description of the GNU
  Emacs Calculator. It works both as an introduction for novices
  and as a reference for experienced users. While it helps to have
  some experience with GNU Emacs in order to get the most out of
  Calc, this manual ought to be readable even if you don&rsquo;t
  know or use Emacs regularly.</p>

  <p>This manual is divided into three major parts: the
  &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; chapter you are reading now, the
  Calc tutorial, and the Calc reference manual.</p>

  <p>If you are in a hurry to use Calc, there is a brief
  &ldquo;demonstration&rdquo; below which illustrates the major
  features of Calc in just a couple of pages. If you don&rsquo;t
  have time to go through the full tutorial, this will show you
  everything you need to know to begin. See <a href=
  "Demonstration-of-Calc.html#Demonstration-of-Calc">Demonstration
  of Calc</a>.</p>

  <p>The tutorial chapter walks you through the various parts of
  Calc with lots of hands-on examples and explanations. If you are
  new to Calc and you have some time, try going through at least
  the beginning of the tutorial. The tutorial includes about 70
  exercises with answers. These exercises give you some guided
  practice with Calc, as well as pointing out some interesting and
  unusual ways to use its features.</p>

  <p>The reference section discusses Calc in complete depth. You
  can read the reference from start to finish if you want to learn
  every aspect of Calc. Or, you can look in the table of contents
  or the Concept Index to find the parts of the manual that discuss
  the things you need to know.</p>

  <p>Every Calc keyboard command is listed in the Calc Summary, and
  also in the Key Index. Algebraic functions, <kbd>M-x</kbd>
  commands, and variables also have their own indices.</p>

  <p>You can access this manual on-line at any time within Calc by
  pressing the <kbd>h i</kbd> key sequence. Outside of the Calc
  window, you can press <kbd>C-x * i</kbd> to read the manual
  on-line. From within Calc the command <kbd>h t</kbd> will jump
  directly to the Tutorial; from outside of Calc the command
  <kbd>C-x * t</kbd> will jump to the Tutorial and start Calc if
  necessary. Pressing <kbd>h s</kbd> or <kbd>C-x * s</kbd> will
  take you directly to the Calc Summary. Within Calc, you can also
  go to the part of the manual describing any Calc key, function,
  or variable using <kbd>h&nbsp;k</kbd><!-- /@w -->, <kbd>h
  f</kbd>, or <kbd>h v</kbd>, respectively. See <a href=
  "Help-Commands.html#Help-Commands">Help Commands</a>.</p>

  <p>The Calc manual can be printed, but because the manual is so
  large, you should only make a printed copy if you really need it.
  To print the manual, you will need the TeX typesetting program
  (this is a free program by Donald Knuth at Stanford University)
  as well as the <samp>texindex</samp> program and
  <samp>texinfo.tex</samp> file, both of which can be obtained from
  the FSF as part of the <code>texinfo</code> package. To print the
  Calc manual in one huge tome, you will need the Emacs source,
  which contains the source code to this manual,
  <samp>calc.texi</samp>. Change to the <samp>doc/misc</samp>
  subdirectory of the Emacs source distribution, which contains
  source code for this manual, and type <kbd>make calc.pdf</kbd>.
  (Don&rsquo;t worry if you get some &ldquo;overfull box&rdquo;
  warnings while TeX runs.) The result will be this entire manual
  as a pdf file.</p>
