  <h4 class="subsection">10.11.5 Other Features of Rewrite
  Rules</h4>

  <p>Certain &ldquo;function names&rdquo; serve as markers in
  rewrite rules. Here is a complete list of these markers. First
  are listed the markers that work inside a pattern; then come the
  markers that work in the righthand side of a rule.</p><a name=
  "index-import" id="index-import"></a>

  <p>One kind of marker, &lsquo;<samp>import(x)</samp>&rsquo;,
  takes the place of a whole rule. Here
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is the name of a variable containing
  another rule set; those rules are &ldquo;spliced into&rdquo; the
  rule set that imports them. For example, if &lsquo;<samp>[f(a+b)
  := f(a) + f(b), f(a b) := a f(b) :: real(a)]</samp>&rsquo; is
  stored in variable &lsquo;<samp>linearF</samp>&rsquo;, then the
  rule set &lsquo;<samp>[f(0) := 0, import(linearF)]</samp>&rsquo;
  will apply all three rules. It is possible to modify the imported
  rules slightly: &lsquo;<samp>import(x, v1, x1, v2, x2,
  &hellip;)</samp>&rsquo; imports the rule set
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; with all occurrences of
  &lsquo;<samp>v1</samp>&rsquo;, as either a variable name or a
  function name, replaced with &lsquo;<samp>x1</samp>&rsquo; and so
  on. (If &lsquo;<samp>v1</samp>&rsquo; is used as a function name,
  then &lsquo;<samp>x1</samp>&rsquo; must be either a function name
  itself or a &lsquo;<samp>&lt;&nbsp;&gt;</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
   nameless function; see <a href=
  "Specifying-Operators.html#Specifying-Operators">Specifying
  Operators</a>.) For example, &lsquo;<samp>[g(0) := 0,
  import(linearF, f, g)]</samp>&rsquo; applies the linearity rules
  to the function &lsquo;<samp>g</samp>&rsquo; instead of
  &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;. Imports can be nested, but the
  import-with-renaming feature may fail to rename sub-imports
  properly.</p>

  <p>The special functions allowed in patterns are:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>quote(x)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-quote" id="index-quote"></a>

      <p>This pattern matches exactly &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;;
      variable names in &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; are not
      interpreted as meta-variables. The only flexibility is that
      numbers are compared for numeric equality, so that the
      pattern &lsquo;<samp>f(quote(12))</samp>&rsquo; will match
      both &lsquo;<samp>f(12)</samp>&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;<samp>f(12.0)</samp>&rsquo;. (Numbers are always
      treated this way by the rewrite mechanism: The rule
      &lsquo;<samp>f(x,x) := g(x)</samp>&rsquo; will match
      &lsquo;<samp>f(12, 12.0)</samp>&rsquo;. The rewrite may
      produce either &lsquo;<samp>g(12)</samp>&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;<samp>g(12.0)</samp>&rsquo; as a result in this
      case.)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>plain(x)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-plain" id="index-plain"></a>

      <p>Here &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; must be a function call
      &lsquo;<samp>f(x1,x2,&hellip;)</samp>&rsquo;. This pattern
      matches a call to function &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; with
      the specified argument patterns. No special knowledge of the
      properties of the function &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; is
      used in this case; &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; is not
      commutative or associative. Unlike <code>quote</code>, the
      arguments &lsquo;<samp>x1,x2,&hellip;</samp>&rsquo; are
      treated as patterns. If you wish them to be treated
      &ldquo;plainly&rdquo; as well, you must enclose them with
      more <code>plain</code> markers:
      &lsquo;<samp>plain(plain(<span class="nolinebreak">-a</span>
      <!-- /@w -->) + plain(b c))</samp>&rsquo;.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>opt(x,def)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-opt" id="index-opt"></a>

      <p>Here &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; must be a variable name.
      This must appear as an argument to a function or an element
      of a vector; it specifies that the argument or element is
      optional. As an argument to &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp>&amp;&amp;</samp>&rsquo;, or
      &lsquo;<samp>||</samp>&rsquo;, or as the second argument to
      &lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>^</samp>&rsquo;,
      the value <var>def</var> may be omitted. The pattern
      &lsquo;<samp>x + opt(y)</samp>&rsquo; matches a sum by
      binding one summand to &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; and the
      other to &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo;, and it matches
      anything else by binding the whole expression to
      &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; and zero to
      &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo;. The other operators above work
      similarly.</p>

      <p>For general miscellaneous functions, the default value
      <code>def</code> must be specified. Optional arguments are
      dropped starting with the rightmost one during matching. For
      example, the pattern &lsquo;<samp>f(opt(a,0), b,
      opt(c,b))</samp>&rsquo; will match
      &lsquo;<samp>f(b)</samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp>f(a,b)</samp>&rsquo;, or
      &lsquo;<samp>f(a,b,c)</samp>&rsquo;. Default values of zero
      and &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo; are supplied in this example
      for the omitted arguments. Note that the literal variable
      &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo; will be the default in the
      latter case, <em>not</em> the value that matched the
      meta-variable &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;. In other words,
      the default <var>def</var> is effectively quoted.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>condition(x,c)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-condition" id="index-condition"></a> <a name=
      "index-_003a_003a" id="index-_003a_003a"></a>

      <p>This matches the pattern &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;,
      with the attached condition &lsquo;<samp>c</samp>&rsquo;. It
      is the same as &lsquo;<samp>x :: c</samp>&rsquo;.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>pand(x,y)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-pand" id="index-pand"></a> <a name=
      "index-_0026_0026_0026" id="index-_0026_0026_0026"></a>

      <p>This matches anything that matches both pattern
      &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; and pattern
      &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo;. It is the same as
      &lsquo;<samp>x &amp;&amp;&amp; y</samp>&rsquo;. see <a href=
      "Composing-Patterns-in-Rewrite-Rules.html#Composing-Patterns-in-Rewrite-Rules">
      Composing Patterns in Rewrite Rules</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>por(x,y)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-por" id="index-por"></a> <a name=
      "index-_007c_007c_007c" id="index-_007c_007c_007c"></a>

      <p>This matches anything that matches either pattern
      &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; or pattern
      &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo;. It is the same as
      &lsquo;<samp>x&nbsp;|||&nbsp;y</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>pnot(x)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-pnot" id="index-pnot"></a> <a name=
      "index-_0021_0021_0021" id="index-_0021_0021_0021"></a>

      <p>This matches anything that does not match pattern
      &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;. It is the same as
      &lsquo;<samp>!!! x</samp>&rsquo;.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>cons(h,t)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-cons-_0028rewrites_0029" id=
      "index-cons-_0028rewrites_0029"></a>

      <p>This matches any vector of one or more elements. The first
      element is matched to &lsquo;<samp>h</samp>&rsquo;; a vector
      of the remaining elements is matched to
      &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;. Note that vectors of fixed
      length can also be matched as actual vectors: The rule
      &lsquo;<samp>cons(a,cons(b,[])) := cons(a+b,[])</samp>&rsquo;
      is equivalent to the rule &lsquo;<samp>[a,b] :=
      [a+b]</samp>&rsquo;.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>rcons(t,h)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-rcons-_0028rewrites_0029" id=
      "index-rcons-_0028rewrites_0029"></a>

      <p>This is like <code>cons</code>, except that the
      <em>last</em> element is matched to
      &lsquo;<samp>h</samp>&rsquo;, with the remaining elements
      matched to &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>apply(f,args)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-apply-_0028rewrites_0029" id=
      "index-apply-_0028rewrites_0029"></a>

      <p>This matches any function call. The name of the function,
      in the form of a variable, is matched to
      &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;. The arguments of the function,
      as a vector of zero or more objects, are matched to
      &lsquo;<samp>args</samp>&rsquo;. Constants, variables, and
      vectors do <em>not</em> match an <code>apply</code> pattern.
      For example, &lsquo;<samp>apply(f,x)</samp>&rsquo; matches
      any function call,
      &lsquo;<samp>apply(quote(f),x)</samp>&rsquo; matches any call
      to the function &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp>apply(f,[a,b])</samp>&rsquo; matches any
      function call with exactly two arguments, and
      &lsquo;<samp>apply(quote(f), cons(a,cons(b,x)))</samp>&rsquo;
      matches any call to the function &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;
      with two or more arguments. Another way to implement the
      latter, if the rest of the rule does not need to refer to the
      first two arguments of &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; by name,
      would be &lsquo;<samp>apply(quote(f), x :: vlen(x) &gt;=
      2)</samp>&rsquo;. Here&rsquo;s a more interesting sample use
      of <code>apply</code>:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
apply(f,[x+n])  :=  n + apply(f,[x])
   :: in(f, [floor,ceil,round,trunc]) :: integer(n)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Note, however, that this will be slower to match than a
      rule set with four separate rules. The reason is that Calc
      sorts the rules of a rule set according to top-level function
      name; if the top-level function is <code>apply</code>, Calc
      must try the rule for every single formula and sub-formula.
      If the top-level function in the pattern is, say,
      <code>floor</code>, then Calc invokes the rule only for
      sub-formulas which are calls to <code>floor</code>.</p>

      <p>Formulas normally written with operators like
      <code>+</code> are still considered function calls:
      <code>apply(f,x)</code> matches
      &lsquo;<samp>a+b</samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp>f =
      add</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>x = [a,b]</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

      <p>You must use <code>apply</code> for meta-variables with
      function names on both sides of a rewrite rule:
      &lsquo;<samp>apply(f, [x]) := f(x+1)</samp>&rsquo; is
      <em>not</em> correct, because it rewrites
      &lsquo;<samp>spam(6)</samp>&rsquo; into
      &lsquo;<samp>f(7)</samp>&rsquo;. The righthand side should be
      &lsquo;<samp>apply(f, [x+1])</samp>&rsquo;. Also note that
      you will have to use No-Simplify mode (<kbd>m O</kbd>) when
      entering this rule so that the <code>apply</code> isn&rsquo;t
      evaluated immediately to get the new rule &lsquo;<samp>f(x)
      := f(x+1)</samp>&rsquo;. Or, use <kbd>s e</kbd> to enter the
      rule without going through the stack, or enter the rule as
      &lsquo;<samp>apply(f, [x]) := apply(f, [x+1]) ::&nbsp;1
      <!-- /@w --></samp>&rsquo;. See <a href=
      "Conditional-Rewrite-Rules.html#Conditional-Rewrite-Rules">Conditional
      Rewrite Rules</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>select(x)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-select" id="index-select"></a>

      <p>This is used for applying rules to formulas with
      selections; see <a href=
      "Selections-with-Rewrite-Rules.html#Selections-with-Rewrite-Rules">
      Selections with Rewrite Rules</a>.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Special functions for the righthand sides of rules are:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>quote(x)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The notation &lsquo;<samp>quote(x)</samp>&rsquo; is
      changed to &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; when the righthand
      side is used. As far as the rewrite rule is concerned,
      <code>quote</code> is invisible. However, <code>quote</code>
      has the special property in Calc that its argument is not
      evaluated. Thus, while it will not work to put the rule
      &lsquo;<samp>t(a) := typeof(a)</samp>&rsquo; on the stack
      because &lsquo;<samp>typeof(a)</samp>&rsquo; is evaluated
      immediately to produce &lsquo;<samp>t(a) :=
      100</samp>&rsquo;, you can use <code>quote</code> to protect
      the righthand side: &lsquo;<samp>t(a) :=
      quote(typeof(a))</samp>&rsquo;. (See <a href=
      "Conditional-Rewrite-Rules.html#Conditional-Rewrite-Rules">Conditional
      Rewrite Rules</a>, for another trick for protecting rules
      from evaluation.)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>plain(x)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Special properties of and simplifications for the function
      call &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; are not used. One
      interesting case where <code>plain</code> is useful is the
      rule, &lsquo;<samp>q(x) := quote(x)</samp>&rsquo;, trying to
      expand a shorthand notation for the <code>quote</code>
      function. This rule will not work as shown; instead of
      replacing &lsquo;<samp>q(foo)</samp>&rsquo; with
      &lsquo;<samp>quote(foo)</samp>&rsquo;, it will replace it
      with &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo;! The correct rule would
      be &lsquo;<samp>q(x) := plain(quote(x))</samp>&rsquo;.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>cons(h,t)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Where &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo; is a vector, this is
      converted into an expanded vector during rewrite processing.
      Note that <code>cons</code> is a regular Calc function which
      normally does this anyway; the only way <code>cons</code> is
      treated specially by rewrites is that <code>cons</code> on
      the righthand side of a rule will be evaluated even if
      default simplifications have been turned off.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>rcons(t,h)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Analogous to <code>cons</code> except putting
      &lsquo;<samp>h</samp>&rsquo; at the <em>end</em> of the
      vector &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>apply(f,args)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Where &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; is a variable and
      <var>args</var> is a vector, this is converted to a function
      call. Once again, note that <code>apply</code> is also a
      regular Calc function.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>eval(x)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-eval" id="index-eval"></a>

      <p>The formula &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is handled in the
      usual way, then the default simplifications are applied to it
      even if they have been turned off normally. This allows you
      to treat any function similarly to the way <code>cons</code>
      and <code>apply</code> are always treated. However, there is
      a slight difference: &lsquo;<samp>cons(2+3, [])</samp>&rsquo;
      with default simplifications off will be converted to
      &lsquo;<samp>[2+3]</samp>&rsquo;, whereas
      &lsquo;<samp>eval(cons(2+3, []))</samp>&rsquo; will be
      converted to &lsquo;<samp>[5]</samp>&rsquo;.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>evalsimp(x)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-evalsimp" id="index-evalsimp"></a>

      <p>The formula &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; has
      meta-variables substituted in the usual way, then
      algebraically simplified.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>evalextsimp(x)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-evalextsimp" id="index-evalextsimp"></a>

      <p>The formula &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; has
      meta-variables substituted in the normal way, then
      &ldquo;extendedly&rdquo; simplified as if by the <kbd>a

  <p>There are also some special functions you can use in
  conditions.</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>let(v := x)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-let" id="index-let"></a>

      <p>The expression &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is evaluated
      with meta-variables substituted. The algebraic
      simplifications are <em>not</em> applied by default, but
      &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; can include calls to
      <code>evalsimp</code> or <code>evalextsimp</code> as
      described above to invoke higher levels of simplification.
      The result of &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is then bound to
      the meta-variable &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo;. As usual, if
      this meta-variable has already been matched to something else
      the two values must be equal; if the meta-variable is new
      then it is bound to the result of the expression. This
      variable can then appear in later conditions, and on the
      righthand side of the rule. In fact,
      &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo; may be any pattern in which case
      the result of evaluating &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is
      matched to that pattern, binding any meta-variables that
      appear in that pattern. Note that <code>let</code> can only
      appear by itself as a condition, or as one term of an
      &lsquo;<samp>&amp;&amp;</samp>&rsquo; which is a whole
      condition: It cannot be inside an
      &lsquo;<samp>||</samp>&rsquo; term or otherwise buried.</p>

      <p>The alternate, equivalent form &lsquo;<samp>let(v,
      x)</samp>&rsquo; is also recognized. Note that the use of
      &lsquo;<samp>:=</samp>&rsquo; by <code>let</code>, while
      still being assignment-like in character, is unrelated to the
      use of &lsquo;<samp>:=</samp>&rsquo; in the main part of a
      rewrite rule.</p>

      <p>As an example, &lsquo;<samp>f(a) := g(ia) :: let(ia :=
      1/a) :: constant(ia)</samp>&rsquo; replaces
      &lsquo;<samp>f(a)</samp>&rsquo; with
      &lsquo;<samp>g</samp>&rsquo; of the inverse of
      &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, if that inverse exists and is
      constant. For example, if &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; is a
      singular matrix the operation &lsquo;<samp>1/a</samp>&rsquo;
      is left unsimplified and
      &lsquo;<samp>constant(ia)</samp>&rsquo; fails, but if
      &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; is an invertible matrix then the
      rule succeeds. Without <code>let</code> there would be no way
      to express this rule that didn&rsquo;t have to invert the
      matrix twice. Note that, because the meta-variable
      &lsquo;<samp>ia</samp>&rsquo; is otherwise unbound in this
      rule, the <code>let</code> condition itself always
      &ldquo;succeeds&rdquo; because no matter what
      &lsquo;<samp>1/a</samp>&rsquo; evaluates to, it can
      successfully be bound to <code>ia</code>.</p>

      <p>Here&rsquo;s another example, for integrating cosines of
      linear terms: &lsquo;<samp>myint(cos(y),x) := sin(y)/b ::
      let([a,b,x] := lin(y,x))</samp>&rsquo;. The <code>lin</code>
      function returns a 3-vector if its argument is linear, or
      leaves itself unevaluated if not. But an unevaluated
      <code>lin</code> call will not match the 3-vector on the
      lefthand side of the <code>let</code>, so this
      <code>let</code> both verifies that <code>y</code> is linear,
      and binds the coefficients <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
      for use elsewhere in the rule. (It would have been possible
      to use &lsquo;<samp>sin(a x + b)/b</samp>&rsquo; for the
      righthand side instead, but using
      &lsquo;<samp>sin(y)/b</samp>&rsquo; avoids gratuitous
      rearrangement of the argument of the sine.)</p><a name=
      "index-ierf" id="index-ierf"></a>

      <p>Similarly, here is a rule that implements an
      inverse-<code>erf</code> function. It uses <code>root</code>
      to search for a solution. If <code>root</code> succeeds, it
      will return a vector of two numbers where the first number is
      the desired solution. If no solution is found,
      <code>root</code> remains in symbolic form. So we use
      <code>let</code> to check that the result was indeed a
      vector.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
ierf(x)  :=  y  :: let([y,z] := root(erf(a) = x, a, .5))
</pre>
      </div>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>matches(v,p)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The meta-variable <var>v</var>, which must already have
      been matched to something elsewhere in the rule, is compared
      against pattern <var>p</var>. Since <code>matches</code> is a
      standard Calc function, it can appear anywhere in a
      condition. But if it appears alone or as a term of a
      top-level &lsquo;<samp>&amp;&amp;</samp>&rsquo;, then you get
      the special extra feature that meta-variables which are bound
      to things inside <var>p</var> can be used elsewhere in the
      surrounding rewrite rule.</p>

      <p>The only real difference between &lsquo;<samp>let(p :=
      v)</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>matches(v, p)</samp>&rsquo;
      is that the former evaluates &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo;
      using the default simplifications, while the latter does
      not.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>remember</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-remember-1" id="index-remember-1"></a>

      <p>This is actually a variable, not a function. If
      <code>remember</code> appears as a condition in a rule, then
      when that rule succeeds the original expression and rewritten
      expression are added to the front of the rule set that
      contained the rule. If the rule set was not stored in a
      variable, <code>remember</code> is ignored. The lefthand side
      is enclosed in <code>quote</code> in the added rule if it
      contains any variables.</p>

      <p>For example, the rule &lsquo;<samp>f(n) := n f(n-1) ::
      remember</samp>&rsquo; applied to
      &lsquo;<samp>f(7)</samp>&rsquo; will add the rule
      &lsquo;<samp>f(7) := 7 f(6)</samp>&rsquo; to the front of the
      rule set. The rule set <code>EvalRules</code> works slightly
      differently: There, the evaluation of
      &lsquo;<samp>f(6)</samp>&rsquo; will complete before the
      result is added to the rule set, in this case as
      &lsquo;<samp>f(7) := 5040</samp>&rsquo;. Thus
      <code>remember</code> is most useful inside
      <code>EvalRules</code>.</p>

      <p>It is up to you to ensure that the optimization performed
      by <code>remember</code> is safe. For example, the rule
      &lsquo;<samp>foo(n) := n :: evalv(eatfoo) &gt; 0 ::
      remember</samp>&rsquo; is a bad idea (<code>evalv</code> is
      the function equivalent of the <kbd>=</kbd> command); if the
      variable <code>eatfoo</code> ever contains 1, rules like
      &lsquo;<samp>foo(7) := 7</samp>&rsquo; will be added to the
      rule set and will continue to operate even if
      <code>eatfoo</code> is later changed to 0.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp>remember(c)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-remember" id="index-remember"></a>

      <p>Remember the match as described above, but only if
      condition &lsquo;<samp>c</samp>&rsquo; is true. For example,
      &lsquo;<samp>remember(n % 4 = 0)</samp>&rsquo; in the above
      factorial rule remembers only every fourth result. Note that
      &lsquo;<samp>remember(1)</samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
      &lsquo;<samp>remember</samp>&rsquo;, and
      &lsquo;<samp>remember(0)</samp>&rsquo; has no effect.</p>
