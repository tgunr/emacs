  <h4 class="subsection">2.3.3 Vectors as Lists</h4><a name=
  "index-Lists" id="index-Lists"></a>

  <p>Although Calc has a number of features for manipulating
  vectors and matrices as mathematical objects, you can also treat
  vectors as simple lists of values. For example, we saw that the
  <kbd>k f</kbd> command returns a vector which is a list of the
  prime factors of a number.</p>

  <p>You can pack and unpack stack entries into vectors:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
3:  10         1:  [10, 20, 30]     3:  10
2:  20             .                2:  20
1:  30                              1:  30
    .                                   .

                   M-3 v p              v u
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>You can also build vectors out of consecutive integers, or out
  of many copies of a given value:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [1, 2, 3, 4]    2:  [1, 2, 3, 4]    2:  [1, 2, 3, 4]
    .               1:  17              1:  [17, 17, 17, 17]
                        .                   .

    v x 4 <span class=
"key">RET</span>           17                  v b 4 <span class=
"key">RET</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>You can apply an operator to every element of a vector using
  the <em>map</em> command.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [17, 34, 51, 68]   1:  [289, 1156, 2601, 4624]  1:  [17, 34, 51, 68]
    .                      .                            .

    V M *                  2 V M ^                      V M Q
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>In the first step, we multiply the vector of integers by the
  vector of 17&rsquo;s elementwise. In the second step, we raise
  each element to the power two. (The general rule is that both
  operands must be vectors of the same length, or else one must be
  a vector and the other a plain number.) In the final step, we
  take the square root of each element.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Compute a vector of
  powers of two from &lsquo;<samp>2^-4</samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp>2^4</samp>&rsquo;. See <a href=
  "List-Answer-1.html#List-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>You can also <em>reduce</em> a binary operator across a
  vector. For example, reducing &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo;
  computes the product of all the elements in the vector:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  123123     1:  [3, 7, 11, 13, 41]      1:  123123
    .              .                           .

    123123         k f                         V R *
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>In this example, we decompose 123123 into its prime factors,
  then multiply those factors together again to yield the original
  number.</p>

  <p>We could compute a dot product &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; using
  mapping and reduction:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  [1, 2, 3]     1:  [7, 12, 0]     1:  19
1:  [7, 6, 0]         .                  .
    .

    r 1 r 2           V M *              V R +
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Recalling two vectors from the previous section, we compute
  the sum of pairwise products of the elements to get the same
  answer for the dot product as before.</p>

  <p>A slight variant of vector reduction is the
  <em>accumulate</em> operation, <kbd>V U</kbd>. This produces a
  vector of the intermediate results from a corresponding
  reduction. Here we compute a table of factorials:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]    1:  [1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720]
    .                         .

    v x 6 <span class="key">RET</span>                 V U *
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Calc allows vectors to grow as large as you like, although it
  gets rather slow if vectors have more than about a hundred
  elements. Actually, most of the time is spent formatting these
  large vectors for display, not calculating on them. Try the
  following experiment (if your computer is very fast you may need
  to substitute a larger vector size).</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [1, 2, 3, 4, ...      1:  [2, 3, 4, 5, ...
    .                         .

    v x 500 <span class="key">RET</span>               1 V M +
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Now press <kbd>v .</kbd> (the letter <kbd>v</kbd>, then a
  period) and try the experiment again. In <kbd>v .</kbd> mode,
  long vectors are displayed &ldquo;abbreviated&rdquo; like
  this:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [1, 2, 3, ..., 500]   1:  [2, 3, 4, ..., 501]
    .                         .

    v x 500 <span class="key">RET</span>               1 V M +
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(where now the &lsquo;<samp>...</samp>&rsquo; is actually part
  of the Calc display). You will find both operations are now much
  faster. But notice that even in <kbd>v&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w -->
   mode, the full vectors are still shown in the Trail. Type
  <kbd>t&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w --> to cause the trail to abbreviate
  as well, and try the experiment one more time. Operations on long
  vectors are now quite fast! (But of course if you use <kbd>t
  .</kbd> you will lose the ability to get old vectors back using
  the <kbd>t y</kbd> command.)</p>

  <p>An easy way to view a full vector when <kbd>v .</kbd> mode is
  active is to press <kbd>`</kbd> (grave accent) to edit the
  vector; editing always works with the full, unabbreviated
  value.</p><a name=

  <p>As a larger example, let&rsquo;s try to fit a straight line to
  some data, using the method of least squares. (Calc has a
  built-in command for least-squares curve fitting, but we&rsquo;ll
  do it by hand here just to practice working with vectors.)
  Suppose we have the following list of values in a file we have
  loaded into Emacs:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
  x        y
 ---      ---
 1.34    0.234
 1.41    0.298
 1.49    0.402
 1.56    0.412
 1.64    0.466
 1.73    0.473
 1.82    0.601
 1.91    0.519
 2.01    0.603
 2.11    0.637
 2.22    0.645
 2.33    0.705
 2.45    0.917
 2.58    1.009
 2.71    0.971
 2.85    1.062
 3.00    1.148
 3.15    1.157
 3.32    1.354
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>If you are reading this tutorial in printed form, you will
  find it easiest to press <kbd>C-x * i</kbd> to enter the on-line
  Info version of the manual and find this table there. (Press
  <kbd>g</kbd>, then type <kbd>List Tutorial</kbd>, to jump
  straight to this section.)</p>

  <p>Position the cursor at the upper-left corner of this table,
  just to the left of the &lsquo;<samp>1.34</samp>&rsquo;. Press
  <kbd>C-@</kbd> to set the mark. (On your system this may be
  <kbd>C-2</kbd>, <kbd>C-<span class="key">SPC</span></kbd>, or
  <kbd>NUL</kbd>.) Now position the cursor to the lower-right, just
  after the &lsquo;<samp>1.354</samp>&rsquo;. You have now defined
  this region as an Emacs &ldquo;rectangle.&rdquo; Still in the
  Info buffer, type <kbd>C-x * r</kbd>. This command
  (<code>calc-grab-rectangle</code>) will pop you back into the
  Calculator, with the contents of the rectangle you specified in
  the form of a matrix.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [ [ 1.34, 0.234 ]
      [ 1.41, 0.298 ]
      &hellip;
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(You may wish to use <kbd>v .</kbd> mode to abbreviate the
  display of this large matrix.)</p>

  <p>We want to treat this as a pair of lists. The first step is to
  transpose this matrix into a pair of rows. Remember, a matrix is
  just a vector of vectors. So we can unpack the matrix into a pair
  of row vectors on the stack.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [ [ 1.34,  1.41,  1.49,  ... ]     2:  [1.34, 1.41, 1.49, ... ]
      [ 0.234, 0.298, 0.402, ... ] ]   1:  [0.234, 0.298, 0.402, ... ]
    .                                      .

    v t                                    v u
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s store these in quick variables 1 and 2,
  respectively.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [1.34, 1.41, 1.49, ... ]        .
    .

    t 2                             t 1
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(Recall that <kbd>t 2</kbd> is a variant of <kbd>s 2</kbd>
  that removes the stored value from the stack.)</p>

  <p>In a least squares fit, the slope &lsquo;<samp>m</samp>&rsquo;
  is given by the formula</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
m = (N sum(x y) - sum(x) sum(y)) / (N sum(x^2) - sum(x)^2)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>where &lsquo;<samp>sum(x)</samp>&rsquo; represents the sum of
  all the values of &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;. While there is an
  actual <code>sum</code> function in Calc, it&rsquo;s easier to
  sum a vector using a simple reduction. First, let&rsquo;s compute
  the four different sums that this formula uses.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  41.63                 1:  98.0003
    .                         .

 r 1 V R +   t 3           r 1 2 V M ^ V R +   t 4

</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  13.613                1:  33.36554
    .                         .

 r 2 V R +   t 5           r 1 r 2 V M * V R +   t 6
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>These are &lsquo;<samp>sum(x)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>sum(x^2)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>sum(y)</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>sum(x
  y)</samp>&rsquo;, respectively. (We could have used <kbd>*</kbd>
  to compute &lsquo;<samp>sum(x^2)</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>sum(x y)</samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  <p>Finally, we also need &lsquo;<samp>N</samp>&rsquo;, the number
  of data points. This is just the length of either of our
  lists.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  19
    .

 r 1 v l   t 7
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(That&rsquo;s <kbd>v</kbd> followed by a lower-case
  <kbd>l</kbd>.)</p>

  <p>Now we grind through the formula:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  633.94526  2:  633.94526  1:  67.23607
    .          1:  566.70919      .
                   .

 r 7 r 6 *      r 3 r 5 *         -

</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  67.23607   3:  67.23607   2:  67.23607   1:  0.52141679
1:  1862.0057  2:  1862.0057  1:  128.9488       .
    .          1:  1733.0569      .
                   .

 r 7 r 4 *      r 3 2 ^           -              /   t 8
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>That gives us the slope &lsquo;<samp>m</samp>&rsquo;. The
  y-intercept &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo; can now be found with
  the simple formula,</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
b = (sum(y) - m sum(x)) / N
</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  13.613     2:  13.613     1:  -8.09358   1:  -0.425978
    .          1:  21.70658       .              .
                   .

   r 5            r 8 r 3 *       -              r 7 /   t 9
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s &ldquo;plot&rdquo; this straight line
  approximation, &lsquo;<samp>m x + b</samp>&rsquo;, and compare it
  with the original data.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [0.699, 0.735, ... ]    1:  [0.273, 0.309, ... ]
    .                           .

    r 1 r 8 *                   r 9 +    s 0
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Notice that multiplying a vector by a constant, and adding a
  constant to a vector, can be done without mapping commands since
  these are common operations from vector algebra. As far as Calc
  is concerned, we&rsquo;ve just been doing geometry in
  19-dimensional space!</p>

  <p>We can subtract this vector from our original
  &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo; vector to get a feel for the error
  of our fit. Let&rsquo;s find the maximum error:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [0.0387, 0.0112, ... ]   1:  [0.0387, 0.0112, ... ]   1:  0.0897
    .                            .                            .

    r 2 -                        V M A                        V R X
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>First we compute a vector of differences, then we take the
  absolute values of these differences, then we reduce the
  <code>max</code> function across the vector. (The
  <code>max</code> function is on the two-key sequence <kbd>f
  x</kbd>; because it is so common to use <code>max</code> in a
  vector operation, the letters <kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>N</kbd> are
  also accepted for <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> in this
  context. In general, you answer the <kbd>V M</kbd> or <kbd>V
  R</kbd> prompt with the actual key sequence that invokes the
  function you want. You could have typed <kbd>V R f x</kbd> or
  even <kbd>V R x max <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> if you had
  preferred.)</p>

  <p>If your system has the GNUPLOT program, you can see graphs of
  your data and your straight line to see how well they match. (If
  you have GNUPLOT 3.0 or higher, the following instructions will
  work regardless of the kind of display you have. Some GNUPLOT
  2.0, non-X-windows systems may require additional steps to view
  the graphs.)</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s start by plotting the original data. Recall the
  &ldquo;<var>x</var>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<var>y</var>&rdquo; vectors
  onto the stack and press <kbd>g f</kbd>. This &ldquo;fast&rdquo;
  graphing command does everything you need to do for simple,
  straightforward plotting of data.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  [1.34, 1.41, 1.49, ... ]
1:  [0.234, 0.298, 0.402, ... ]
    .

    r 1 r 2    g f
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>If all goes well, you will shortly get a new window containing
  a graph of the data. (If not, contact your GNUPLOT or Calc
  installer to find out what went wrong.) In the X window system,
  this will be a separate graphics window. For other kinds of
  displays, the default is to display the graph in Emacs itself
  using rough character graphics. Press <kbd>q</kbd> when you are
  done viewing the character graphics.</p>

  <p>Next, let&rsquo;s add the line we got from our least-squares
  fit.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  [1.34, 1.41, 1.49, ... ]

    .

    <span class="key">DEL</span> r 0    g a  g p
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>It&rsquo;s not very useful to get symbols to mark the data
  points on this second curve; you can type <kbd>g S g p</kbd> to
  remove them. Type <kbd>g q</kbd> when you are done to remove the
  X graphics window and terminate GNUPLOT.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> An earlier exercise
  showed how to do least squares fitting to a general system of
  equations. Our 19 data points are really 19 equations of the form
  &lsquo;<samp>y_i = m x_i + b</samp>&rsquo; for different pairs of
  &lsquo;<samp>(x_i,y_i)</samp>&rsquo;. Use the matrix-transpose
  method to solve for &lsquo;<samp>m</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;, duplicating the above result. See
  <a href="List-Answer-2.html#List-Answer-2">2</a>.

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> If the input data do not
  form a rectangle, you can use <kbd><span class=
  "nolinebreak">C-x</span>&nbsp;*&nbsp;g</kbd><!-- /@w -->
   (<code>calc-grab-region</code>) to grab the data the way Emacs
  normally works with regions&mdash;it reads left-to-right,
  top-to-bottom, treating line breaks the same as spaces. Use this
  command to find the geometric mean of the following numbers. (The
  geometric mean is the <var>n</var>th root of the product of
  <var>n</var> numbers.)</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
2.3  6  22  15.1  7
  15  14  7.5
  2.5
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <kbd>C-x * g</kbd> command accepts numbers separated by
  spaces or commas, with or without surrounding vector brackets.
  See <a href="List-Answer-3.html#List-Answer-3">3</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>As another example, a theorem about binomial coefficients
  tells us that the alternating sum of binomial coefficients
  <var>n</var>-choose-0 minus <var>n</var>-choose-1 plus
  <var>n</var>-choose-2, and so on up to
  <var>n</var>-choose-<var>n</var>, always comes out to zero.
  Let&rsquo;s verify this for &lsquo;<samp>n=6</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">

    V M ' (-1)^$ choose(6,$) <span class=
"key">RET</span>             V R +
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <kbd>V M '</kbd> command prompts you to enter any
  algebraic expression to define the function to map over the
  vector. The symbol &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; inside this
  expression represents the argument to the function. The
  Calculator applies this formula to each element of the vector,
  substituting each element&rsquo;s value for the
  &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; sign(s) in turn.</p>

  <p>To define a two-argument function, use
  &lsquo;<samp>$$</samp>&rsquo; for the first argument and
  &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; for the second: <kbd>V M ' $$-$
  <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> is equivalent to <kbd>V M
  -</kbd>. This is analogous to regular algebraic entry, where
  &lsquo;<samp>$$</samp>&rsquo; would refer to the next-to-top
  stack entry and &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; would refer to the
  top stack entry, and <kbd>' $$-$ <span class=
  "key">RET</span></kbd> would act exactly like <kbd>-</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Notice that the <kbd>V M '</kbd> command has recorded two
  things in the trail: The result, as usual, and also a
  funny-looking thing marked &lsquo;<samp>oper</samp>&rsquo; that
  represents the operator function you typed in. The function is
  enclosed in &lsquo;<samp>&lt; &gt;</samp>&rsquo; brackets, and
  the argument is denoted by a &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo; sign.
  If there were several arguments, they would be shown as
  &lsquo;<samp>#1</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>#2</samp>&rsquo;, and
  so on. (For example, <kbd>V M ' $$-$</kbd> will put the function
  &lsquo;<samp>&lt;#1 - #2&gt;</samp>&rsquo; on the trail.) This
  object is a &ldquo;nameless function&rdquo;; you can use nameless
  &lsquo;<samp>&lt;&nbsp;&gt;</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> notation to
  answer the <kbd>V M '</kbd> prompt if you like. Nameless function
  notation has the interesting, occasionally useful property that a
  nameless function is not actually evaluated until it is used. For
  example, <kbd>V M ' $+random(2.0)</kbd> evaluates
  &lsquo;<samp>random(2.0)</samp>&rsquo; once and adds that random
  number to all elements of the vector, but <kbd>V M '
  &lt;#+random(2.0)&gt;</kbd> evaluates the
  &lsquo;<samp>random(2.0)</samp>&rsquo; separately for each vector
  element.</p>

  <p>Another group of operators that are often useful with <kbd>V
  M</kbd> are the relational operators: <kbd>a =</kbd>, for
  example, compares two numbers and gives the result 1 if they are
  equal, or 0 if not. Similarly, <kbd>a&nbsp;&lt;</kbd><!-- /@w -->
   checks for one number being less than another.</p>

  <p>Other useful vector operations include <kbd>v v</kbd>, to
  reverse a vector end-for-end; <kbd>V S</kbd>, to sort the
  elements of a vector into increasing order; and <kbd>v r</kbd>
  and <kbd>v&nbsp;c</kbd><!-- /@w -->, to extract one row or column
  of a matrix, or (in both cases) to extract one element of a plain
  vector. With a negative argument, <kbd>v r</kbd> and <kbd>v
  c</kbd> instead delete one row, column, or vector
  element.</p><a name="index-Divisor-functions" id=

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 13.</strong> An algebraic entry of a
  string in double-quote marks, &lsquo;<samp>"hello"</samp>&rsquo;,
  creates a vector of the numerical (ASCII) codes of the characters
  (here, &lsquo;<samp>[104, 101, 108, 108, 111]</samp>&rsquo;).
  Sometimes it is convenient to compute a <em>hash code</em> of a
  string, which is just an integer that represents the value of
  that string. Two equal strings have the same hash code; two
  different strings <em>probably</em> have different hash codes.
  (For example, Calc has over 400 function names, but Emacs can
  quickly find the definition for any given name because it has
  sorted the functions into &ldquo;buckets&rdquo; by their hash
  codes. Sometimes a few names will hash into the same bucket, but
  it is easier to search among a few names than among all the
  names.) One popular hash function is computed as follows: First
  set &lsquo;<samp>h = 0</samp>&rsquo;. Then, for each character
  from the string in turn, set &lsquo;<samp>h = 3h +
  c_i</samp>&rsquo; where &lsquo;<samp>c_i</samp>&rsquo; is the
  character&rsquo;s ASCII code. If we have 511 buckets, we then
  take the hash code modulo 511 to get the bucket number. Develop a
  simple command or commands for converting string vectors into
  hash codes. The hash code for &lsquo;<samp>"Testing, 1, 2,
  3"</samp>&rsquo; is 1960915098, which modulo 511 is 121. See
  <a href="List-Answer-13.html#List-Answer-13">13</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 14.</strong> The <kbd>H V R</kbd>
  and <kbd>H V U</kbd> commands do nested function evaluations.
  <kbd>H V U</kbd> takes a starting value and a number of steps
  <var>n</var> from the stack; it then applies the function you
  give to the starting value 0, 1, 2, up to <var>n</var> times and
  returns a vector of the results. Use this command to create a
  &ldquo;random walk&rdquo; of 50 steps. Start with the
  two-dimensional point &lsquo;<samp>(0,0)</samp>&rsquo;; then take
  one step a random distance between <i>-1</i> and 1 in both
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo;;
  then take another step, and so on. Use the <kbd>g f</kbd> command
  to display this random walk. Now modify your random walk to walk
  a unit distance, but in a random direction, at each step. (Hint:
  The <code>sincos</code> function returns a vector of the cosine
  and sine of an angle.) See <a href=
