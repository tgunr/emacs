  <h3 class="section">1.6 History and Acknowledgments</h3>

  <p>Calc was originally started as a two-week project to occupy a
  lull in the author&rsquo;s schedule. Basically, a friend asked if
  I remembered the value of &lsquo;<samp>2^32</samp>&rsquo;. I
  didn&rsquo;t offhand, but I said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s easy, just
  call up an <code>xcalc</code>.&rdquo; <code>Xcalc</code> duly
  reported that the answer to our question was
  &lsquo;<samp>4.294967e+09</samp>&rsquo;&mdash;with no way to see
  the full ten digits even though we knew they were there in the
  program&rsquo;s memory! I was so annoyed, I vowed to write a
  calculator of my own, once and for all.</p>

  <p>I chose Emacs Lisp, a) because I had always been curious about
  it and b) because, being only a text editor extension language
  after all, Emacs Lisp would surely reach its limits long before
  the project got too far out of hand.</p>

  <p>To make a long story short, Emacs Lisp turned out to be a
  distressingly solid implementation of Lisp, and the humble task
  of calculating turned out to be more open-ended than one might
  have expected.</p>

  <p>Emacs Lisp didn&rsquo;t have built-in floating point math (now
  it does), so this had to be simulated in software. In fact, Emacs
  integers would only comfortably fit six decimal digits or so (at
  the time)&mdash;not enough for a decent calculator. So I had to
  write my own high-precision integer code as well, and once I had
  this I figured that arbitrary-size integers were just as easy as
  large integers. Arbitrary floating-point precision was the
  logical next step. Also, since the large integer arithmetic was
  there anyway it seemed only fair to give the user direct access
  to it, which in turn made it practical to support fractions as
  well as floats. All these features inspired me to look around for
  other data types that might be worth having.</p>

  <p>Around this time, my friend Rick Koshi showed me his nifty new
  HP-28 calculator. It allowed the user to manipulate formulas as
  well as numerical quantities, and it could also operate on
  matrices. I decided that these would be good for Calc to have,
  too. And once things had gone this far, I figured I might as well
  take a look at serious algebra systems for further ideas. Since
  these systems did far more than I could ever hope to implement, I
  decided to focus on rewrite rules and other programming features
  so that users could implement what they needed for
  themselves.</p>

  <p>Rick complained that matrices were hard to read, so I put in
  code to format them in a 2D style. Once these routines were in
  place, Big mode was obligatory. Gee, what other language modes
  would be useful?</p>

  <p>Scott Hemphill and Allen Knutson, two friends with a strong
  mathematical bent, contributed ideas and algorithms for a number
  of Calc features including modulo forms, primality testing, and
  float-to-fraction conversion.</p>

  <p>Units were added at the eager insistence of Mass Sivilotti.
  Later, Ulrich Mueller at CERN and Przemek Klosowski at NIST
  provided invaluable expert assistance with the units table. As
  far as I can remember, the idea of using algebraic formulas and
  variables to represent units dates back to an ancient article in
  Byte magazine about muMath, an early algebra system for
  microcomputers.</p>

  <p>Many people have contributed to Calc by reporting bugs and
  suggesting features, large and small. A few deserve special
  mention: Tim Peters, who helped develop the ideas that led to the
  selection commands, rewrite rules, and many other algebra
  features; Fran&Atilde;&sect;ois Pinard, who contributed an early
  prototype of the Calc Summary appendix as well as providing
  valuable suggestions in many other areas of Calc; Carl Witty,
  whose eagle eyes discovered many typographical and factual errors
  in the Calc manual; Tim Kay, who drove the development of
  Embedded mode; Ove Ewerlid, who made many suggestions relating to
  the algebra commands and contributed some code for polynomial
  operations; Randal Schwartz, who suggested the
  <code>calc-eval</code> function; Juha Sarlin, who first worked
  out how to split Calc into quickly-loading parts; Bob Weiner, who
  helped immensely with the Lucid Emacs port; and Robert J.
  Chassell, who suggested the Calc Tutorial and exercises as well
  as many other things.</p><a name="index-Bibliography" id=

  <p>Among the books used in the development of Calc were
  Knuth&rsquo;s <em>Art of Computer Programming</em> (especially
  volume II, <em>Seminumerical Algorithms</em>); <em>Numerical
  Recipes</em> by Press, Flannery, Teukolsky, and Vetterling;
  Bevington&rsquo;s <em>Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the
  Physical Sciences</em>; <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> by Graham,
  Knuth, and Patashnik; Steele&rsquo;s <em>Common Lisp, the
  Language</em>; the <em>CRC Standard Math Tables</em> (William H.
  Beyer, ed.); and Abramowitz and Stegun&rsquo;s venerable
  <em>Handbook of Mathematical Functions</em>. Also, of course,
  Calc could not have been written without the excellent <em>GNU
  Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</em>, by Bil Lewis and Dan
  LaLiberte.</p>

  <p>Final thanks go to Richard Stallman, without whose fine
  implementations of the Emacs editor, language, and environment,
  Calc would have been finished in two weeks.</p>
