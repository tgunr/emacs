  <p>It is possible to get Calc to apply a set of rewrite rules on
  all results, effectively adding to the built-in set of default
  simplifications. To do this, simply store your rule set in the
  variable <code>EvalRules</code>. There is a convenient <kbd>s
  E</kbd> command for editing <code>EvalRules</code>; see <a href=
  "Operations-on-Variables.html#Operations-on-Variables">Operations
  on Variables</a>.</p>

  <p>For example, suppose you want &lsquo;<samp>sin(a +
  b)</samp>&rsquo; to be expanded out to &lsquo;<samp>sin(b) cos(a)
  + cos(b) sin(a)</samp>&rsquo; wherever it appears, and similarly
  for &lsquo;<samp>cos(a + b)</samp>&rsquo;. The corresponding
  rewrite rule set would be,</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
[ sin(a + b)  :=  cos(a) sin(b) + sin(a) cos(b),
  cos(a + b)  :=  cos(a) cos(b) - sin(a) sin(b) ]
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>To apply these manually, you could put them in a variable
  called <code>trigexp</code> and then use <kbd>a r trigexp</kbd>
  every time you wanted to expand trig functions. But if instead
  you store them in the variable <code>EvalRules</code>, they will
  automatically be applied to all sines and cosines of sums. Then,
  with &lsquo;<samp>2 x</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>45</samp>&rsquo; on the stack, typing <kbd>+ S</kbd>
  will (assuming Degrees mode) result in &lsquo;<samp>0.7071 sin(2
  x) + 0.7071 cos(2 x)</samp>&rsquo; automatically.</p>

  <p>As each level of a formula is evaluated, the rules from
  <code>EvalRules</code> are applied before the default
  simplifications. Rewriting continues until no further
  <code>EvalRules</code> apply. Note that this is different from
  the usual order of application of rewrite rules:
  <code>EvalRules</code> works from the bottom up, simplifying the
  arguments to a function before the function itself, while <kbd>a
  r</kbd> applies rules from the top down.</p>

  <p>Because the <code>EvalRules</code> are tried first, you can
  use them to override the normal behavior of any built-in Calc
  function.</p>

  <p>It is important not to write a rule that will get into an
  infinite loop. For example, the rule set &lsquo;<samp>[f(0) := 1,
  f(n) := n f(n-1)]</samp>&rsquo; appears to be a good definition
  of a factorial function, but it is unsafe. Imagine what happens
  if &lsquo;<samp>f(2.5)</samp>&rsquo; is simplified. Calc will
  continue to subtract 1 from this argument forever without
  reaching zero. A safer second rule would be &lsquo;<samp>f(n) :=
  n f(n-1) :: n&gt;0</samp>&rsquo;. Another dangerous rule is
  &lsquo;<samp>g(x, y) := g(y, x)</samp>&rsquo;. Rewriting
  &lsquo;<samp>g(2, 4)</samp>&rsquo;, this would bounce back and
  forth between that and &lsquo;<samp>g(4, 2)</samp>&rsquo;
  forever. If an infinite loop in <code>EvalRules</code> occurs,
  Emacs will eventually stop with a &ldquo;Computation got stuck or
  ran too long&rdquo; message.</p>

  <p>Another subtle difference between <code>EvalRules</code> and
  regular rewrites concerns rules that rewrite a formula into an
  identical formula. For example, &lsquo;<samp>f(n) :=
  f(floor(n))</samp>&rsquo; &ldquo;fails to match&rdquo; when
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; is already an integer. But in
  <code>EvalRules</code> this case is detected only if the
  righthand side literally becomes the original formula before any
  further simplification. This means that &lsquo;<samp>f(n) :=
  f(floor(n))</samp>&rsquo; will get into an infinite loop if it
  occurs in <code>EvalRules</code>. Calc will replace
  &lsquo;<samp>f(6)</samp>&rsquo; with
  &lsquo;<samp>f(floor(6))</samp>&rsquo;, which is different from
  &lsquo;<samp>f(6)</samp>&rsquo;, so it will consider the rule to
  have matched and will continue simplifying that formula; first
  the argument is simplified to get
  &lsquo;<samp>f(6)</samp>&rsquo;, then the rule matches again to
  get &lsquo;<samp>f(floor(6))</samp>&rsquo; again, ad infinitum. A
  much safer rule would check its argument first, say, with
  &lsquo;<samp>f(n) := f(floor(n)) :: !dint(n)</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>(What really happens is that the rewrite mechanism substitutes
  the meta-variables in the righthand side of a rule, compares to
  see if the result is the same as the original formula and fails
  if so, then uses the default simplifications to simplify the
  result and compares again (and again fails if the formula has
  simplified back to its original form). The only special wrinkle
  for the <code>EvalRules</code> is that the same rules will come
  back into play when the default simplifications are used. What
  Calc wants to do is build &lsquo;<samp>f(floor(6))</samp>&rsquo;,
  see that this is different from the original formula, simplify to
  &lsquo;<samp>f(6)</samp>&rsquo;, see that this is the same as the
  original formula, and thus halt the rewriting. But while
  simplifying, &lsquo;<samp>f(6)</samp>&rsquo; will again trigger
  the same <code>EvalRules</code> rule and Calc will get into a
  loop inside the rewrite mechanism itself.)</p>

  <p>The <code>phase</code>, <code>schedule</code>, and
  <code>iterations</code> markers do not work in
  <code>EvalRules</code>. If the rule set is divided into phases,
  only the phase 1 rules are applied, and the schedule is ignored.
  The rules are always repeated as many times as possible.</p>

  <p>The <code>EvalRules</code> are applied to all function calls
  in a formula, but not to numbers (and other number-like objects
  like error forms), nor to vectors or individual variable names.
  (Though they will apply to <em>components</em> of vectors and
  error forms when appropriate.) You might try to make a variable
  <code>phihat</code> which automatically expands to its definition
  without the need to press <kbd>=</kbd> by writing the rule
  &lsquo;<samp>quote(phihat) := (1-sqrt(5))/2</samp>&rsquo;, but
  unfortunately this rule will not work as part of
  <code>EvalRules</code>.</p>

  <p>Finally, another limitation is that Calc sometimes calls its
  built-in functions directly rather than going through the default
  simplifications. When it does this, <code>EvalRules</code> will
  not be able to override those functions. For example, when you
  take the absolute value of the complex number &lsquo;<samp>(2,
  3)</samp>&rsquo;, Calc computes &lsquo;<samp>sqrt(2*2 +
  3*3)</samp>&rsquo; by calling the multiplication, addition, and
  square root functions directly rather than applying the default
  simplifications to this formula. So an <code>EvalRules</code>
  rule that (perversely) rewrites &lsquo;<samp>sqrt(13) :=
  6</samp>&rsquo; would not apply. (However, if you put Calc into
  Symbolic mode so that &lsquo;<samp>sqrt(13)</samp>&rsquo; will be
  left in symbolic form by the built-in square root function, your
  rule will be able to apply. But if the complex number were
  &lsquo;<samp>(3,4)</samp>&rsquo;, so that
  &lsquo;<samp>sqrt(25)</samp>&rsquo; must be calculated, then
  Symbolic mode will not help because
  &lsquo;<samp>sqrt(25)</samp>&rsquo; can be evaluated exactly to
  5.)</p>

  <p>One subtle restriction that normally only manifests itself
  with <code>EvalRules</code> is that while a given rewrite rule is
  in the process of being checked, that same rule cannot be
  recursively applied. Calc effectively removes the rule from its
  rule set while checking the rule, then puts it back once the
  match succeeds or fails. (The technical reason for this is that
  compiled pattern programs are not reentrant.) For example,
  consider the rule &lsquo;<samp>foo(x) := x :: foo(x/2) &gt;
  0</samp>&rsquo; attempting to match
  &lsquo;<samp>foo(8)</samp>&rsquo;. This rule will be inactive
  while the condition &lsquo;<samp>foo(4) &gt; 0</samp>&rsquo; is
  checked, even though it might be an integral part of evaluating
  that condition. Note that this is not a problem for the more
  usual recursive type of rule, such as &lsquo;<samp>foo(x) :=
  foo(x/2)</samp>&rsquo;, because there the rule has succeeded and
  been reactivated by the time the righthand side is evaluated.</p>

  <p>If <code>EvalRules</code> has no stored value (its default
  state), or if anything but a vector is stored in it, then it is
  ignored.</p>

  <p>Even though Calc&rsquo;s rewrite mechanism is designed to
  compare rewrite rules to formulas as quickly as possible, storing
  rules in <code>EvalRules</code> may make Calc run substantially
  slower. This is particularly true of rules where the top-level
  call is a commonly used function, or is not fixed. The rule
  &lsquo;<samp>f(n) := n f(n-1) :: n&gt;0</samp>&rsquo; will only
  activate the rewrite mechanism for calls to the function
  <code>f</code>, but &lsquo;<samp>lg(n) + lg(m) := lg(n
  m)</samp>&rsquo; will check every &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo;
  operator.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
apply(f, [a*b]) := apply(f, [a]) + apply(f, [b]) :: in(f, [ln, log10])
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>may seem more &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; than two separate rules
  for <code>ln</code> and <code>log10</code>, but actually it is
  vastly less efficient because rules with <code>apply</code> as
  the top-level pattern must be tested against <em>every</em>
  function call that is simplified.</p><a name=
  "index-AlgSimpRules-variable" id=
  "index-AlgSimpRules-variable"></a> <a name="index-AlgSimpRules"
  id="index-AlgSimpRules"></a>

  <p>Suppose you want &lsquo;<samp>sin(a + b)</samp>&rsquo; to be
  expanded out not all the time, but only when algebraic
  simplifications are used to simplify the formula. The variable
  <code>AlgSimpRules</code> holds rules for this purpose. The
  <kbd>a s</kbd> command will apply <code>EvalRules</code> and
  <code>AlgSimpRules</code> to the formula, as well as all of its
  built-in simplifications.</p>

  <p>Most of the special limitations for <code>EvalRules</code>
  don&rsquo;t apply to <code>AlgSimpRules</code>. Calc simply does
  an <kbd>a r AlgSimpRules</kbd> command with an infinite repeat
  count as the first step of algebraic simplifications. It then
  applies its own built-in simplifications throughout the formula,
  and then repeats these two steps (along with applying the default
  simplifications) until no further changes are
  possible.</p><a name="index-ExtSimpRules-variable" id=
  "index-ExtSimpRules-variable"></a> <a name=
  "index-UnitSimpRules-variable" id=
  "index-UnitSimpRules-variable"></a> <a name="index-ExtSimpRules"
  id="index-ExtSimpRules"></a> <a name="index-UnitSimpRules" id=
  "index-UnitSimpRules"></a>

  <p>There are also <code>ExtSimpRules</code> and
  <code>UnitSimpRules</code> variables that are used by <kbd>a
  e</kbd> and <kbd>u s</kbd>, respectively; these commands also
  apply <code>EvalRules</code> and <code>AlgSimpRules</code>. The
  variable <code>IntegSimpRules</code> contains simplification
  rules that are used only during integration by <kbd>a
  i</kbd>.</p>
