  <h4 class="subsection">10.11.7 Nested Formulas with Rewrite
  Rules</h4>

  <p>When <kbd>a r</kbd> (<code>calc-rewrite</code>) is used, it
  takes an expression from the top of the stack and attempts to
  match any of the specified rules to any part of the expression,
  starting with the whole expression and then, if that fails,
  trying deeper and deeper sub-expressions. For each part of the
  expression, the rules are tried in the order they appear in the
  rules vector. The first rule to match the first sub-expression
  wins; it replaces the matched sub-expression according to the
  <var>new</var> part of the rule.</p>

  <p>Often, the rule set will match and change the formula several
  times. The top-level formula is first matched and substituted
  repeatedly until it no longer matches the pattern; then,
  sub-formulas are tried, and so on. Once every part of the formula
  has gotten its chance, the rewrite mechanism starts over again
  with the top-level formula (in case a substitution of one of its
  arguments has caused it again to match). This continues until no
  further matches can be made anywhere in the formula.</p>

  <p>It is possible for a rule set to get into an infinite loop.
  The most obvious case, replacing a formula with itself, is not a
  problem because a rule is not considered to &ldquo;succeed&rdquo;
  unless the righthand side actually comes out to something
  different than the original formula or sub-formula that was
  matched. But if you accidentally had both &lsquo;<samp>ln(a b) :=
  ln(a) + ln(b)</samp>&rsquo; and the reverse &lsquo;<samp>ln(a) +
  ln(b) := ln(a b)</samp>&rsquo; in your rule set, Calc would run
  forever switching a formula back and forth between the two
  forms.</p>

  <p>To avoid disaster, Calc normally stops after 100 changes have
  been made to the formula. This will be enough for most multiple
  rewrites, but it will keep an endless loop of rewrites from
  locking up the computer forever. (On most systems, you can also
  type <kbd>C-g</kbd> to halt any Emacs command prematurely.)</p>

  <p>To change this limit, give a positive numeric prefix argument.
  In particular, <kbd>M-1 a r</kbd> applies only one rewrite at a
  time, useful when you are first testing your rule (or just if
  repeated rewriting is not what is called for by your
  application).</p><a name="index-iterations" id=
  "index-iterations"></a>

  <p>You can also put a &ldquo;function call&rdquo;
  &lsquo;<samp>iterations(<var>n</var>)</samp>&rsquo; in place of a
  rule anywhere in your rules vector (but usually at the top).
  Then, <var>n</var> will be used instead of 100 as the default
  number of iterations for this rule set. You can use
  &lsquo;<samp>iterations(inf)</samp>&rsquo; if you want no
  iteration limit by default. A prefix argument will override the
  <code>iterations</code> limit in the rule set.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
[ iterations(1),
  f(x) := f(x+1) ]
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>More precisely, the limit controls the number of
  &ldquo;iterations,&rdquo; where each iteration is a successful
  matching of a rule pattern whose righthand side, after
  substituting meta-variables and applying the default
  simplifications, is different from the original sub-formula that
  was matched.</p>

  <p>A prefix argument of zero sets the limit to infinity. Use with
  caution!</p>

  <p>Given a negative numeric prefix argument, <kbd>a r</kbd> will
  match and substitute the top-level expression up to that many
  times, but will not attempt to match the rules to any
  sub-expressions.</p>

  <p>In a formula, <code>rewrite(<var>expr</var>, <var>rules</var>,
  <var>n</var>)</code> does a rewriting operation. Here
  <var>expr</var> is the expression being rewritten,
  <var>rules</var> is the rule, vector of rules, or variable
  containing the rules, and <var>n</var> is the optional iteration
  limit, which may be a positive integer, a negative integer, or
  &lsquo;<samp>inf</samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp>-inf</samp>&rsquo;. If <var>n</var> is omitted the
  <code>iterations</code> value from the rule set is used; if both
  are omitted, 100 is used.</p>
