  <h4 class="subsection">10.11.9 Selections with Rewrite Rules</h4>

  <p>If a sub-formula of the current formula is selected (as by
  <kbd>j s</kbd>; see <a href=
  "Selecting-Subformulas.html#Selecting-Subformulas">Selecting
  Subformulas</a>), the <kbd>a r</kbd> (<code>calc-rewrite</code>)
  command applies only to that sub-formula. Together with a
  negative prefix argument, you can use this fact to apply a
  rewrite to one specific part of a formula without affecting any
  other parts.</p><a name="index-j-r" id="index-j-r"></a> <a name=
  "index-calc_002drewrite_002dselection" id=
  "index-calc_002drewrite_002dselection"></a>

  <p>The <kbd>j r</kbd> (<code>calc-rewrite-selection</code>)
  command allows more sophisticated operations on selections. This
  command prompts for the rules in the same way as <kbd>a r</kbd>,
  but it then applies those rules to the whole formula in question
  even though a sub-formula of it has been selected. However, the
  selected sub-formula will first have been surrounded by a
  &lsquo;<samp>select( )</samp>&rsquo; function call. (Calc&rsquo;s
  evaluator does not understand the function name
  <code>select</code>; this is only a tag used by the <kbd>j
  r</kbd> command.)</p>

  <p>For example, suppose the formula on the stack is
  &lsquo;<samp>2 (a + b)^2</samp>&rsquo; and the sub-formula
  &lsquo;<samp>a + b</samp>&rsquo; is selected. This formula will
  be rewritten to &lsquo;<samp>2 select(a + b)^2</samp>&rsquo; and
  then the rewrite rules will be applied in the usual way. The
  rewrite rules can include references to <code>select</code> to
  tell where in the pattern the selected sub-formula should
  appear.</p>

  <p>If there is still exactly one &lsquo;<samp>select(
  )</samp>&rsquo; function call in the formula after rewriting is
  done, it indicates which part of the formula should be selected
  afterwards. Otherwise, the formula will be unselected.</p>

  <p>You can make <kbd>j r</kbd> act much like <kbd>a r</kbd> by
  enclosing both parts of the rewrite rule with
  &lsquo;<samp>select()</samp>&rsquo;. However, <kbd>j r</kbd>
  allows you to use the current selection in more flexible ways.
  Suppose you wished to make a rule which removed the exponent from
  the selected term; the rule &lsquo;<samp>select(a)^x :=
  select(a)</samp>&rsquo; would work. In the above example, it
  would rewrite &lsquo;<samp>2 select(a + b)^2</samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp>2 select(a + b)</samp>&rsquo;. This would then be
  returned to the stack as &lsquo;<samp>2 (a + b)</samp>&rsquo;
  with the &lsquo;<samp>a + b</samp>&rsquo; selected.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>j r</kbd> command uses one iteration by default,
  unlike <kbd>a r</kbd> which defaults to 100 iterations. A numeric
  prefix argument affects <kbd>j r</kbd> in the same way as <kbd>a
  r</kbd>. See <a href=
  "Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules.html#Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules">
  Nested Formulas with Rewrite Rules</a>.</p>

  <p>As with other selection commands, <kbd>j r</kbd> operates on
  the stack entry that contains the cursor. (If the cursor is on
  the top-of-stack &lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo; marker, it works as
  if the cursor were on the formula at stack level 1.)</p>

  <p>If you don&rsquo;t specify a set of rules, the rules are taken
  from the top of the stack, just as with <kbd>a r</kbd>. In this
  case, the cursor must indicate stack entry 2 or above as the
  formula to be rewritten (otherwise the same formula would be used
  as both the target and the rewrite rules).</p>

  <p>If the indicated formula has no selection, the cursor position
  within the formula temporarily selects a sub-formula for the
  purposes of this command. If the cursor is not on any sub-formula
  (e.g., it is in the line-number area to the left of the formula),
  the &lsquo;<samp>select( )</samp>&rsquo; markers are ignored by
  the rewrite mechanism and the rules are allowed to apply anywhere
  in the formula.</p>

  <p>As a special feature, the normal <kbd>a r</kbd> command also
  ignores &lsquo;<samp>select( )</samp>&rsquo; calls in rewrite
  rules. For example, if you used the above rule
  &lsquo;<samp>select(a)^x := select(a)</samp>&rsquo; with <kbd>a
  r</kbd>, it would apply the rule as if it were &lsquo;<samp>a^x
  := a</samp>&rsquo;. Thus, you can write general purpose rules
  with &lsquo;<samp>select( )</samp>&rsquo; hints inside them so
  that they will &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo; in both <kbd>a
  r</kbd> and <kbd>j r</kbd>, both with and without selections.</p>
