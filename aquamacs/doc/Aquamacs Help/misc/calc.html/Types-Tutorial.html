  <h3 class="section">2.4 Types Tutorial</h3>

  <p>Calc understands a variety of data types as well as simple
  numbers. In this section, we&rsquo;ll experiment with each of
  these types in turn.</p>

  <p>The numbers we&rsquo;ve been using so far have mainly been
  either <em>integers</em> or <em>floats</em>. We saw that floats
  are usually a good approximation to the mathematical concept of
  real numbers, but they are only approximations and are
  susceptible to roundoff error. Calc also supports
  <em>fractions</em>, which can exactly represent any rational
  number.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  3628800    2:  3628800    1:  518400:7   1:  518414:7   1:  7:518414
    .          1:  49             .              .              .
                   .

    10 !           49 <span class=
"key">RET</span>         :              2 +            &amp;
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <kbd>:</kbd> command divides two integers to get a
  fraction; <kbd>/</kbd> would normally divide integers to get a
  floating-point result. Notice we had to type <tt class=
  "key">RET</tt> between the <kbd>49</kbd> and the <kbd>:</kbd>
  since the <kbd>:</kbd> would otherwise be interpreted as part of
  a fraction beginning with 49.</p>

  <p>You can convert between floating-point and fractional format
  using <kbd>c f</kbd> and <kbd>c F</kbd>:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  1.35027217629e-5    1:  7:518414
    .                       .

    c f                     c F
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <kbd>c F</kbd> command replaces a floating-point number
  with the &ldquo;simplest&rdquo; fraction whose floating-point
  representation is the same, to within the current precision.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  3.14159265359   1:  1146408:364913   1:  3.1416   1:  355:113
    .                   .                    .            .

    P                   c F      <span class=
"key">DEL</span>       p 5 <span class="key">RET</span> P      c F
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> A calculation has
  produced the result 1.26508260337. You suspect it is the square
  root of the product of &lsquo;<samp>pi</samp>&rsquo; and some
  rational number. Is it? (Be sure to allow for roundoff error!)
  See <a href="Types-Answer-1.html#Types-Answer-1">1</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p><em>Complex numbers</em> can be stored in both rectangular and
  polar form.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  -9     1:  (0, 3)    1:  (3; 90.)   1:  (6; 90.)   1:  (2.4495; 45.)
    .          .             .              .              .

    9 n        Q             c p            2 *            Q
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The square root of <i>-9</i> is by default rendered in
  rectangular form (&lsquo;<samp>0&nbsp;+&nbsp;3i</samp>&rsquo;
  <!-- /@w -->), but we can convert it to polar form (3 with a
  phase angle of 90 degrees). All the usual arithmetic and
  scientific operations are defined on both types of complex
  numbers.</p>

  <p>Another generalized kind of number is <em>infinity</em>.
  Infinity isn&rsquo;t really a number, but it can sometimes be
  treated like one. Calc uses the symbol <code>inf</code> to
  represent positive infinity, i.e., a value greater than any real
  number. Naturally, you can also write
  &lsquo;<samp>-inf</samp>&rsquo; for minus infinity, a value less
  than any real number. The word <code>inf</code> can only be input
  using algebraic entry.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  inf        2:  -inf       2:  -inf       2:  -inf       1:  nan
1:  -17        1:  -inf       1:  -inf       1:  inf            .
    .              .              .              .

' inf <span class="key">RET</span> 17 n     *  <span class=
"key">RET</span>         72 +           A              +
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Since infinity is infinitely large, multiplying it by any
  finite number (like <i>-17</i>) has no effect, except that since
  <i>-17</i> is negative, it changes a plus infinity to a minus
  infinity. (&ldquo;A huge positive number, multiplied by
  <i>-17</i>, yields a huge negative number.&rdquo;) Adding any
  finite number to infinity also leaves it unchanged. Taking an
  absolute value gives us plus infinity again. Finally, we add this
  plus infinity to the minus infinity we had earlier. If you work
  it out, you might expect the answer to be <i>-72</i> for this.
  But the 72 has been completely lost next to the infinities; by
  the time we compute &lsquo;<samp>inf&nbsp;<span class=
  "nolinebreak">-</span>&nbsp;inf</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
   the finite difference between them, if any, is undetectable. So
  we say the result is <em>indeterminate</em>, which Calc writes
  with the symbol <code>nan</code> (for Not A Number).</p>

  <p>Dividing by zero is normally treated as an error, but you can
  get Calc to write an answer in terms of infinity by pressing
  <kbd>m i</kbd> to turn on Infinite mode.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
3:  nan        2:  nan        2:  nan        2:  nan        1:  nan
2:  1          1:  1 / 0      1:  uinf       1:  uinf           .
1:  0              .              .              .
    .

  1 <span class=
"key">RET</span> 0          /       m i    U /            17 n *         +
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Dividing by zero normally is left unevaluated, but after
  <kbd>m i</kbd> it instead gives an infinite result. The answer is
  actually <code>uinf</code>, &ldquo;undirected infinity.&rdquo; If
  you look at a graph of &lsquo;<samp>1 / x</samp>&rsquo; around
  &lsquo;<samp>x&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->,
  you&rsquo;ll see that it goes toward plus infinity as you
  approach zero from above, but toward minus infinity as you
  approach from below. Since we said only &lsquo;<samp>1 /
  0</samp>&rsquo;, Calc knows that the answer is infinite but not
  in which direction. That&rsquo;s what <code>uinf</code> means.
  Notice that multiplying <code>uinf</code> by a negative number
  still leaves plain <code>uinf</code>; there&rsquo;s no point in
  saying &lsquo;<samp>-uinf</samp>&rsquo; because the sign of
  <code>uinf</code> is unknown anyway. Finally, we add
  <code>uinf</code> to our <code>nan</code>, yielding
  <code>nan</code> again. It&rsquo;s easy to see that, because
  <code>nan</code> means &ldquo;totally unknown&rdquo; while
  <code>uinf</code> means &ldquo;unknown sign but known to be
  infinite,&rdquo; the more mysterious <code>nan</code> wins out
  when it is combined with <code>uinf</code>, or, for that matter,
  with anything else.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Predict what Calc will
  answer for each of these formulas: &lsquo;<samp>inf /
  inf</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>exp(inf)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>exp(-inf)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>sqrt(-inf)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>sqrt(uinf)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>abs(uinf)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>ln(0)</samp>&rsquo;. See <a href=
  "Types-Answer-2.html#Types-Answer-2">2</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> We saw that
  &lsquo;<samp>inf - inf = nan</samp>&rsquo;, which stands for an
  unknown value. Can <code>nan</code> stand for a complex number?
  Can it stand for infinity? See <a href=
  "Types-Answer-3.html#Types-Answer-3">3</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p><em>HMS forms</em> represent a value in terms of hours,
  minutes, and seconds.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  2@ 30' 0"     1:  3@ 30' 0"     2:  3@ 30' 0"     1:  2.
    .                 .             1:  1@ 45' 0."        .
                                        .

  2@ 30' <span class=
"key">RET</span>          1 +               <span class=
"key">RET</span> 2 /           /
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>HMS forms can also be used to hold angles in degrees, minutes,
  and seconds.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  0.5        1:  26.56505   1:  26@ 33' 54.18"    1:  0.44721
    .              .              .                     .

    0.5            I T            c h                   S
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>First we convert the inverse tangent of 0.5 to
  degrees-minutes-seconds form, then we take the sine of that
  angle. Note that the trigonometric functions will accept HMS
  forms directly as input.</p><a name="index-Beatles" id=
  "index-Beatles"></a>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 4.</strong> The Beatles&rsquo;
  <em>Abbey Road</em> is 47 minutes and 26 seconds long, and
  contains 17 songs. What is the average length of a song on
  <em>Abbey Road</em>? If the Extended Disco Version of <em>Abbey
  Road</em> added 20 seconds to the length of each song, how long
  would the album be? See <a href=
  "Types-Answer-4.html#Types-Answer-4">4</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>A <em>date form</em> represents a date, or a date and time.
  Dates must be entered using algebraic entry. Date forms are
  surrounded by &lsquo;<samp>&lt; &gt;</samp>&rsquo; symbols; most
  standard formats for dates are recognized.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  &lt;Sun Jan 13, 1991&gt;                    1:  2.25
1:  &lt;6:00pm Thu Jan 10, 1991&gt;                 .
    .

' &lt;13 Jan 1991&gt;, &lt;1/10/91, 6pm&gt; <span class=
"key">RET</span>           -
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>In this example, we enter two dates, then subtract to find the
  number of days between them. It is also possible to add an HMS
  form or a number (of days) to a date form to get another date
  form.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  &lt;4:45:59pm Mon Jan 14, 1991&gt;     1:  &lt;2:50:59am Thu Jan 17, 1991&gt;
    .                                    .

    t N                                  2 + 10@ 5' +
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <kbd>t N</kbd> (&ldquo;now&rdquo;) command pushes the
  current date and time on the stack; then we add two days, ten
  hours and five minutes to the date and time. Other date-and-time
  related commands include <kbd>t J</kbd>, which does Julian day
  conversions, <kbd>t W</kbd>, which finds the beginning of the
  week in which a date form lies, and <kbd>t I</kbd>, which
  increments a date by one or several months. See <a href=
  "Date-Arithmetic.html#Date-Arithmetic">Date Arithmetic</a>, for
  more.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 5.</strong> How many days until the
  next Friday the 13th? See <a href=

  there be between now and the year 10001 AD? See <a href=

  <p>An <em>error form</em> represents a mean value with an
  attached standard deviation, or error estimate. Suppose our
  measurements indicate that a certain telephone pole is about 30
  meters away, with an estimated error of 1 meter, and 8 meters
  tall, with an estimated error of 0.2 meters. What is the slope of
  a line from here to the top of the pole, and what is the
  equivalent angle in degrees?</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  8 +/- 0.2    2:  8 +/- 0.2   1:  0.266 +/- 0.011   1:  14.93 +/- 0.594
    .            1:  30 +/- 1        .                     .
                     .

    8 p .2 <span class=
"key">RET</span>       30 p 1          /                     I T
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This means that the angle is about 15 degrees, and, assuming
  our original error estimates were valid standard deviations,
  there is about a 60% chance that the result is correct within
  0.59 degrees.</p><a name="index-Torus_002c-volume-of" id=
  "index-Torus_002c-volume-of"></a>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 7.</strong> The volume of a torus (a
  donut shape) is
  &lsquo;<samp>2&nbsp;pi^2&nbsp;R&nbsp;r^2</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
   where &lsquo;<samp>R</samp>&rsquo; is the radius of the circle
  that defines the center of the tube and
  &lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo; is the radius of the tube itself.
  Suppose &lsquo;<samp>R</samp>&rsquo; is 20 cm and
  &lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo; is 4 cm, each known to within 5
  percent. What is the volume and the relative uncertainty of the
  volume? See <a href="Types-Answer-7.html#Types-Answer-7">7</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>An <em>interval form</em> represents a range of values. While
  an error form is best for making statistical estimates, intervals
  give you exact bounds on an answer. Suppose we additionally know
  that our telephone pole is definitely between 28 and 31 meters
  away, and that it is between 7.7 and 8.1 meters tall.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [7.7 .. 8.1]  2:  [7.7 .. 8.1]  1:  [0.24 .. 0.28]  1:  [13.9 .. 16.1]
    .             1:  [28 .. 31]        .                   .
                      .

  [ 7.7 .. 8.1 ]    [ 28 .. 31 ]        /                   I T
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>If our bounds were correct, then the angle to the top of the
  pole is sure to lie in the range shown.</p>

  <p>The square brackets around these intervals indicate that the
  endpoints themselves are allowable values. In other words, the
  distance to the telephone pole is between 28 and 31,
  <em>inclusive</em>. You can also make an interval that is
  exclusive of its endpoints by writing parentheses instead of
  square brackets. You can even make an interval which is inclusive
  (&ldquo;closed&rdquo;) on one end and exclusive
  (&ldquo;open&rdquo;) on the other.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  [1 .. 10)    1:  (0.1 .. 1]   2:  (0.1 .. 1]   1:  (0.2 .. 3)
    .                .            1:  [2 .. 3)         .
                                      .

  [ 1 .. 10 )        &amp;              [ 2 .. 3 )         *
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The Calculator automatically keeps track of which end values
  should be open and which should be closed. You can also make
  infinite or semi-infinite intervals by using
  &lsquo;<samp>-inf</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>inf</samp>&rsquo;
  for one or both endpoints.</p>

  <p>A <em>modulo form</em> is used for performing arithmetic
  modulo <var>m</var>. For example, arithmetic involving time is
  generally done modulo 12 or 24 hours.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">

  </div>

  <p>In this last step, Calc has divided by 5 modulo 24; i.e., it
  has found a new number which, when multiplied by 5 modulo 24,
  produces the original number, 21. If <var>m</var> is prime and
  the divisor is not a multiple of <var>m</var>, it is always
  possible to find such a number. For non-prime <var>m</var> like
  24, it is only sometimes possible.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  10 mod 24    1:  16 mod 24    1:  1000000...   1:  16

  <p>These two calculations get the same answer, but the first one
  is much more efficient because it avoids the huge intermediate
  value that arises in the second one.</p><a name=

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 10.</strong> A theorem of Pierre de
  Fermat says that &lsquo;<samp>x^(n-1) mod n = 1</samp>&rsquo; if
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; is a prime number and
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is an integer less than
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;. If &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; is
  <em>not</em> a prime number, this will <em>not</em> be true for
  most values of &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;. Thus we can test
  informally if a number is prime by trying this formula for
  several values of &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;. Use this test to
  tell whether the following numbers are prime: 811749613,
  15485863. See <a href=
  "Types-Answer-10.html#Types-Answer-10">10</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>It is possible to use HMS forms as parts of error forms,
  intervals, modulo forms, or as the phase part of a polar complex
  number. For example, the <code>calc-time</code> command pushes
  the current time of day on the stack as an HMS/modulo form.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 12.</strong> You are preparing to
  order packaging for the CD release of the Extended Disco Version
  of <em>Abbey Road</em>. You are told that the songs will actually
  be anywhere from 20 to 60 seconds longer than the originals. One

  <p>Another kind of data the Calculator can manipulate is numbers
  with <em>units</em>. This isn&rsquo;t strictly a new data type;
  it&rsquo;s simply an application of algebraic expressions, where
  we use variables with suggestive names like
  &lsquo;<samp>cm</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>in</samp>&rsquo;
  to represent units like centimeters and inches.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  2 in        1:  5.08 cm      1:  0.027778 fath   1:  0.0508 m
    .               .                .                   .

"key">RET</span>       u c fath <span class=
"key">RET</span>        u b
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>We enter the quantity &ldquo;2 inches&rdquo; (actually an
  algebraic expression which means two times the variable
  &lsquo;<samp>in</samp>&rsquo;), then we convert it first to
  centimeters, then to fathoms, then finally to &ldquo;base&rdquo;
  units, which in this case means meters.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  9 acre     1:  3 sqrt(acre)   1:  190.84 m   1:  190.84 m + 30 cm

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">

    u s              2 ^                   u c cgs
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Since units expressions are really just formulas, taking the
  square root of &lsquo;<samp>acre</samp>&rsquo; is undefined.
  After all, <code>acre</code> might be an algebraic variable that
  you will someday assign a value. We use the
  &ldquo;units-simplify&rdquo; command to simplify the expression
  with variables being interpreted as unit names.</p>

  <p>In the final step, we have converted not to a particular unit,
  but to a units system. The &ldquo;cgs&rdquo; system uses
  centimeters instead of meters as its standard unit of length.</p>

  <p>There is a wide variety of units defined in the
  Calculator.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">

</pre>
  </div>

  <p>We express a speed first in miles per hour, then in kilometers
  per hour, then again using a slightly more explicit notation,
  then finally in terms of fractions of the speed of light.</p>

  <p>Temperature conversions are a bit more tricky. There are two
  ways to interpret &ldquo;20 degrees Fahrenheit&rdquo;&mdash;it
  could mean an actual temperature, or it could mean a change in
  temperature. For normal units there is no difference, but
  temperature units have an offset as well as a scale factor and so
  there must be two explicit commands for them.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  20 degF       1:  11.1111 degC     1:  -6.666 degC

  <p>First we convert a change of 20 degrees Fahrenheit into an
  equivalent change in degrees Celsius (or Centigrade). Then, we
  convert the absolute temperature 20 degrees Fahrenheit into
  Celsius.</p>
