  <h4 class="subsection">10.8.5 Curve Fitting Details</h4>

  <p>Calc&rsquo;s internal least-squares fitter can only handle
  multilinear models. More precisely, it can handle any model of
  the form &lsquo;<samp>a f(x,y,z) + b g(x,y,z) + c
  h(x,y,z)</samp>&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<samp>a,b,c</samp>&rsquo;
  are the parameters and &lsquo;<samp>x,y,z</samp>&rsquo; are the
  independent variables (of course there can be any number of each,
  not just three).</p>

  <p>In a simple multilinear or polynomial fit, it is easy to see
  how to convert the model into this form. For example, if the
  model is &lsquo;<samp>a + b x + c x^2</samp>&rsquo;, then
  &lsquo;<samp>f(x) = 1</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>g(x) =
  x</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>h(x) = x^2</samp>&rsquo; are
  suitable functions.</p>

  <p>For most other models, Calc uses a variety of algebraic
  manipulations to try to put the problem into the form</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
Y(x,y,z) = A(a,b,c) F(x,y,z) + B(a,b,c) G(x,y,z) + C(a,b,c) H(x,y,z)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>where &lsquo;<samp>Y,A,B,C,F,G,H</samp>&rsquo; are arbitrary
  functions. It computes &lsquo;<samp>Y</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>F</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>G</samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp>H</samp>&rsquo; for all the data points, does a
  standard linear fit to find the values of
  &lsquo;<samp>A</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>B</samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp>C</samp>&rsquo;, then uses the equation solver to
  solve for &lsquo;<samp>a,b,c</samp>&rsquo; in terms of
  &lsquo;<samp>A,B,C</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>A remarkable number of models can be cast into this general
  form. We&rsquo;ll look at two examples here to see how it works.
  The power-law model &lsquo;<samp>y = a x^b</samp>&rsquo; with two
  independent variables and two parameters can be rewritten as
  follows:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
y = a x^b
y = a exp(b ln(x))
y = exp(ln(a) + b ln(x))
ln(y) = ln(a) + b ln(x)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>which matches the desired form with &lsquo;<samp>Y =
  ln(y)</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>A = ln(a)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>F = 1</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>B =
  b</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>G = ln(x)</samp>&rsquo;. Calc
  thus computes the logarithms of your &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo;
  and &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; values, does a linear fit for
  &lsquo;<samp>A</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>B</samp>&rsquo;,
  then solves to get &lsquo;<samp>a = exp(A)</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>b = B</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Another interesting example is the &ldquo;quadratic&rdquo;
  model, which can be handled by expanding according to the
  distributive law.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
y = a + b*(x - c)^2
y = a + b c^2 - 2 b c x + b x^2
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>which matches with &lsquo;<samp>Y = y</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>A = a + b c^2</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>F =
  1</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>B = -2 b c</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>G = x</samp>&rsquo; (the <i>-2</i> factor could just
  as easily have been put into &lsquo;<samp>G</samp>&rsquo; instead
  of &lsquo;<samp>B</samp>&rsquo;), &lsquo;<samp>C =
  b</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>H = x^2</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The Gaussian model looks quite complicated, but a closer
  examination shows that it&rsquo;s actually similar to the
  quadratic model but with an exponential that can be brought to
  the top and moved into &lsquo;<samp>Y</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The logistic models cannot be put into general linear form.
  For these models, and the Hubbert linearization, Calc computes a
  rough approximation for the parameters, then uses the
  Levenberg-Marquardt iterative method to refine the
  approximations.</p>

  <p>Another model that cannot be put into general linear form is a
  Gaussian with a constant background added on, i.e.,
  &lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo; + the regular Gaussian formula. If
  you have a model like this, your best bet is to replace enough of
  your parameters with constants to make the model linearizable,
  then adjust the constants manually by doing a series of fits. You
  can compare the fits by graphing them, by examining the
  goodness-of-fit measures returned by <kbd>I a F</kbd>, or by some
  other method suitable to your application. Note that some models
  can be linearized in several ways. The Gaussian-plus-<var>d</var>
  model can be linearized by setting &lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo;
  (the background) to a constant, or by setting
  &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo; (the standard deviation) and
  &lsquo;<samp>c</samp>&rsquo; (the mean) to constants.</p>

  <p>To fit a model with constants substituted for some parameters,
  just store suitable values in those parameter variables, then
  omit them from the list of parameters when you answer the
  variables prompt.</p>

  <p>A last desperate step would be to use the general-purpose
  <code>minimize</code> function rather than <code>fit</code>.
  After all, both functions solve the problem of minimizing an
  expression (the &lsquo;<samp>chi^2</samp>&rsquo; sum) by
  adjusting certain parameters in the expression. The <kbd>a
  F</kbd> command is able to use a vastly more efficient algorithm
  due to its special knowledge about linear chi-square sums, but
  the <kbd>a N</kbd> command can do the same thing by brute
  force.</p>

  <p>A compromise would be to pick out a few parameters without
  which the fit is linearizable, and use <code>minimize</code> on a
  call to <code>fit</code> which efficiently takes care of the rest
  of the parameters. The thing to be minimized would be the value
  of &lsquo;<samp>chi^2</samp>&rsquo; returned as the fifth result
  of the <code>xfit</code> function:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
minimize(xfit(gaus(a,b,c,d,x), x, [a,b,c], data)_5, d, guess)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>where <code>gaus</code> represents the Gaussian model with
  background, <code>data</code> represents the data matrix, and
  <code>guess</code> represents the initial guess for
  &lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo; that <code>minimize</code> requires.
  This operation will only be, shall we say, extraordinarily slow
  rather than astronomically slow (as would be the case if
  <code>minimize</code> were used by itself to solve the
  problem).</p>

  <p>The <kbd>I a F</kbd> [<code>xfit</code>] command is somewhat
  trickier when nonlinear models are used. The second item in the
  result is the vector of &ldquo;raw&rdquo; parameters
  &lsquo;<samp>A</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>B</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>C</samp>&rsquo;. The covariance matrix is written in
  terms of those raw parameters. The fifth item is a vector of
  <em>filter</em> expressions. This is the empty vector
  &lsquo;<samp>[]</samp>&rsquo; if the raw parameters were the same
  as the requested parameters, i.e., if &lsquo;<samp>A =
  a</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>B = b</samp>&rsquo;, and so on
  (which is always true if the model is already linear in the
  parameters as written, e.g., for polynomial fits). If the
  parameters had to be rearranged, the fifth item is instead a
  vector of one formula per parameter in the original model. The
  raw parameters are expressed in these &ldquo;filter&rdquo;
  formulas as &lsquo;<samp>fitdummy(1)</samp>&rsquo; for
  &lsquo;<samp>A</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>fitdummy(2)</samp>&rsquo; for
  &lsquo;<samp>B</samp>&rsquo;, and so on.</p>

  <p>When Calc needs to modify the model to return the result, it
  replaces &lsquo;<samp>fitdummy(1)</samp>&rsquo; in all the
  filters with the first item in the raw parameters list, and so on
  for the other raw parameters, then evaluates the resulting filter
  formulas to get the actual parameter values to be substituted
  into the original model. In the case of <kbd>H a F</kbd> and
  <kbd>I a F</kbd> where the parameters must be error forms, Calc
  uses the square roots of the diagonal entries of the covariance
  matrix as error values for the raw parameters, then lets
  Calc&rsquo;s standard error-form arithmetic take it from
  there.</p>

  <p>If you use <kbd>I a F</kbd> with a nonlinear model, be sure to
  remember that the covariance matrix is in terms of the raw
  parameters, <em>not</em> the actual requested parameters.
  It&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to interpret the
  covariances in the presence of nontrivial filter functions.</p>

  <p>Things are also complicated when the input contains error
  forms. Suppose there are three independent and dependent
  variables, &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo;,
  one or more of which are error forms in the data. Calc combines
  all the error values by taking the square root of the sum of the
  squares of the errors. It then changes
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo; to
  be plain numbers, and makes &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo; into an
  error form with this combined error. The
  &lsquo;<samp>Y(x,y,z)</samp>&rsquo; part of the linearized model
  is evaluated, and the result should be an error form. The error
  part of that result is used for
  &lsquo;<samp>sigma_i</samp>&rsquo; for the data point. If for
  some reason &lsquo;<samp>Y(x,y,z)</samp>&rsquo; does not return
  an error form, the combined error from
  &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo; is used directly for
  &lsquo;<samp>sigma_i</samp>&rsquo;. Finally,
  &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo; is also stripped of its error for
  use in computing &lsquo;<samp>F(x,y,z)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>G(x,y,z)</samp>&rsquo; and so on; the righthand side
  of the linearized model is computed in regular arithmetic with no
  error forms.</p>

  <p>(While these rules may seem complicated, they are designed to
  do the most reasonable thing in the typical case that
  &lsquo;<samp>Y(x,y,z)</samp>&rsquo; depends only on the dependent
  variable &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo;, and in fact is often
  simply equal to &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo;. For common cases
  like polynomials and multilinear models, the combined error is
  simply used as the &lsquo;<samp>sigma</samp>&rsquo; for the data
  point with no further ado.)</p><a name="index-FitRules" id=
  "index-FitRules"></a>

  <p>It may be the case that the model you wish to use is
  linearizable, but Calc&rsquo;s built-in rules are unable to
  figure it out. Calc uses its algebraic rewrite mechanism to
  linearize a model. The rewrite rules are kept in the variable
  <code>FitRules</code>. You can edit this variable using the
  <kbd>s e FitRules</kbd> command; in fact, there is a special
  <kbd>s F</kbd> command just for editing <code>FitRules</code>.
  See <a href=
  "Operations-on-Variables.html#Operations-on-Variables">Operations
  on Variables</a>.</p>

  <p>See <a href="Rewrite-Rules.html#Rewrite-Rules">Rewrite
  Rules</a>, for a discussion of rewrite rules.</p><a name=
  "index-fitvar" id="index-fitvar"></a> <a name="index-fitparam"
  id="index-fitparam"></a> <a name="index-fitmodel" id=
  "index-fitmodel"></a> <a name="index-fitsystem" id=
  "index-fitsystem"></a> <a name="index-fitdummy" id=
  "index-fitdummy"></a>

  <p>Calc uses <code>FitRules</code> as follows. First, it converts
  the model to an equation if necessary and encloses the model
  equation in a call to the function <code>fitmodel</code> (which
  is not actually a defined function in Calc; it is only used as a
  placeholder by the rewrite rules). Parameter variables are
  renamed to function calls &lsquo;<samp>fitparam(1)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>fitparam(2)</samp>&rsquo;, and so on, and
  independent variables are renamed to
  &lsquo;<samp>fitvar(1)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>fitvar(2)</samp>&rsquo;, etc. The dependent variable
  is the highest-numbered <code>fitvar</code>. For example, the
  power law model &lsquo;<samp>a x^b</samp>&rsquo; is converted to
  &lsquo;<samp>y = a x^b</samp>&rsquo;, then to</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
fitmodel(fitvar(2) = fitparam(1) fitvar(1)^fitparam(2))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Calc then applies the rewrites as if by &lsquo;<samp>C-u 0 a r
  FitRules</samp>&rsquo;. (The zero prefix means that rewriting
  should continue until no further changes are possible.)</p>

  <p>When rewriting is complete, the <code>fitmodel</code> call
  should have been replaced by a <code>fitsystem</code> call that
  looks like this:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
fitsystem(<var>Y</var>, <var>FGH</var>, <var>abc</var>)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>where <var>Y</var> is a formula that describes the function
  &lsquo;<samp>Y(x,y,z)</samp>&rsquo;, <var>FGH</var> is the vector
  of formulas &lsquo;<samp>[F(x,y,z), G(x,y,z),
  H(x,y,z)]</samp>&rsquo;, and <var>abc</var> is the vector of
  parameter filters which refer to the raw parameters as
  &lsquo;<samp>fitdummy(1)</samp>&rsquo; for
  &lsquo;<samp>A</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>fitdummy(2)</samp>&rsquo; for
  &lsquo;<samp>B</samp>&rsquo;, etc. While the number of raw
  parameters (the length of the <var>FGH</var> vector) is usually
  the same as the number of original parameters (the length of the
  <var>abc</var> vector), this is not required.</p>

  <p>The power law model eventually boils down to</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
fitsystem(ln(fitvar(2)),
          [1, ln(fitvar(1))],
          [exp(fitdummy(1)), fitdummy(2)])
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The actual implementation of <code>FitRules</code> is
  complicated; it proceeds in four phases. First, common
  rearrangements are done to try to bring linear terms together and
  to isolate functions like <code>exp</code> and <code>ln</code>
  either all the way &ldquo;out&rdquo; (so that they can be put
  into <var>Y</var>) or all the way &ldquo;in&rdquo; (so that they
  can be put into <var>abc</var> or <var>FGH</var>). In particular,
  all non-constant powers are converted to logs-and-exponentials
  form, and the distributive law is used to expand products of
  sums. Quotients are rewritten to use the
  &lsquo;<samp>fitinv</samp>&rsquo; function, where
  &lsquo;<samp>fitinv(x)</samp>&rsquo; represents
  &lsquo;<samp>1/x</samp>&rsquo; while the <code>FitRules</code>
  are operating. (The use of <code>fitinv</code> makes recognition
  of linear-looking forms easier.) If you modify
  <code>FitRules</code>, you will probably only need to modify the
  rules for this phase.</p>

  <p>Phase two, whose rules can actually also apply during phases
  one and three, first rewrites <code>fitmodel</code> to a
  two-argument form &lsquo;<samp>fitmodel(<var>Y</var>,
  <var>model</var>)</samp>&rsquo;, where <var>Y</var> is initially
  zero and <var>model</var> has been changed from
  &lsquo;<samp>a=b</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>a-b</samp>&rsquo;
  form. It then tries to peel off invertible functions from the
  outside of <var>model</var> and put them into <var>Y</var>
  instead, calling the equation solver to invert the functions.
  Finally, when this is no longer possible, the
  <code>fitmodel</code> is changed to a four-argument
  <code>fitsystem</code>, where the fourth argument is
  <var>model</var> and the <var>FGH</var> and <var>abc</var>
  vectors are initially empty. (The last vector is really
  <var>ABC</var>, corresponding to raw parameters, for now.)</p>

  <p>Phase three converts a sum of items in the <var>model</var> to
  a sum of &lsquo;<samp>fitpart(<var>a</var>, <var>b</var>,
  <var>c</var>)</samp>&rsquo; terms which represent terms
  &lsquo;<samp><var>a</var>*<var>b</var>*<var>c</var></samp>&rsquo;
  of the sum, where <var>a</var> is all factors that do not involve
  any variables, <var>b</var> is all factors that involve only
  parameters, and <var>c</var> is the factors that involve only
  independent variables. (If this decomposition is not possible,
  the rule set will not complete and Calc will complain that the
  model is too complex.) Then <code>fitpart</code>s with equal
  <var>b</var> or <var>c</var> components are merged back together
  using the distributive law in order to minimize the number of raw
  parameters needed.</p>

  <p>Phase four moves the <code>fitpart</code> terms into the
  <var>FGH</var> and <var>ABC</var> vectors. Also, some of the
  algebraic expansions that were done in phase 1 are undone now to
  make the formulas more computationally efficient. Finally, it
  calls the solver one more time to convert the <var>ABC</var>
  vector to an <var>abc</var> vector, and removes the fourth
  <var>model</var> argument (which by now will be zero) to obtain
  the three-argument <code>fitsystem</code> that the linear
  least-squares solver wants to see.</p><a name=
  "index-hasfitparams" id="index-hasfitparams"></a> <a name=
  "index-hasfitvars" id="index-hasfitvars"></a>

  <p>Two functions which are useful in connection with
  <code>FitRules</code> are
  &lsquo;<samp>hasfitparams(x)</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>hasfitvars(x)</samp>&rsquo;, which check whether
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; refers to any parameters or
  independent variables, respectively. Specifically, these
  functions return &ldquo;true&rdquo; if the argument contains any
  <code>fitparam</code> (or <code>fitvar</code>) function calls,
  and &ldquo;false&rdquo; otherwise. (Recall that
  &ldquo;true&rdquo; means a nonzero number, and
  &ldquo;false&rdquo; means zero. The actual nonzero number
  returned is the largest <var>n</var> from all the
  &lsquo;<samp>fitparam(<var>n</var>)</samp>&rsquo;s or
  &lsquo;<samp>fitvar(<var>n</var>)</samp>&rsquo;s, respectively,
  that appear in the formula.)</p>

  <p>The <code>fit</code> function in algebraic notation normally
  takes four arguments, &lsquo;<samp>fit(<var>model</var>,
  <var>vars</var>, <var>params</var>,
  <var>data</var>)</samp>&rsquo;, where <var>model</var> is the
  model formula as it would be typed after <kbd>a F '</kbd>,
  <var>vars</var> is the independent variable or a vector of
  independent variables, <var>params</var> likewise gives the
  parameter(s), and <var>data</var> is the data matrix. Note that
  the length of <var>vars</var> must be equal to the number of rows
  in <var>data</var> if <var>model</var> is an equation, or one
  less than the number of rows if <var>model</var> is a plain
  formula. (Actually, a name for the dependent variable is allowed
  but will be ignored in the plain-formula case.)</p>

  <p>If <var>params</var> is omitted, the parameters are all
  variables in <var>model</var> except those that appear in
  <var>vars</var>. If <var>vars</var> is also omitted, Calc sorts
  all the variables that appear in <var>model</var> alphabetically
  and uses the higher ones for <var>vars</var> and the lower ones
  for <var>params</var>.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, &lsquo;<samp>fit(<var>modelvec</var>,
  <var>data</var>)</samp>&rsquo; is allowed where
  <var>modelvec</var> is a 2- or 3-vector describing the model and
  variables, as discussed previously.</p>

  <p>If Calc is unable to do the fit, the <code>fit</code> function
  is left in symbolic form, ordinarily with an explanatory message.
  The message will be &ldquo;Model expression is too complex&rdquo;
  if the linearizer was unable to put the model into the required
  form.</p>

  <p>The <code>efit</code> (corresponding to <kbd>H a F</kbd>) and
  <code>xfit</code> (for <kbd>I a F</kbd>) functions are completely
  analogous.</p>
