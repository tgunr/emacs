  <h3 class="section">4.9 Date Forms</h3><a name="index-Date-forms"
  id="index-Date-forms"></a>

  <p>A <em>date form</em> represents a date and possibly an
  associated time. Simple date arithmetic is supported: Adding a
  number to a date produces a new date shifted by that many days;
  adding an HMS form to a date shifts it by that many hours.
  Subtracting two date forms computes the number of days between
  them (represented as a simple number). Many other operations,
  such as multiplying two date forms, are nonsensical and are not
  allowed by Calc.</p>

  <p>Date forms are entered and displayed enclosed in
  &lsquo;<samp>&lt; &gt;</samp>&rsquo; brackets. The default format
  is, e.g., &lsquo;<samp>&lt;Wed Jan 9, 1991&gt;</samp>&rsquo; for
  dates, or &lsquo;<samp>&lt;3:32:20pm Wed Jan 9,
  1991&gt;</samp>&rsquo; for dates with times. Input is flexible;
  date forms can be entered in any of the usual notations for dates
  and times. See <a href="Date-Formats.html#Date-Formats">Date
  Formats</a>.</p>

  <p>Date forms are stored internally as numbers, specifically the
  number of days since midnight on the morning of December 31 of
  the year 1 BC. If the internal number is an integer, the form
  represents a date only; if the internal number is a fraction or
  float, the form represents a date and time. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp>&lt;6:00am Thu Jan 10, 1991&gt;</samp>&rsquo; is
  represented by the number 726842.25. The standard precision of 12
  decimal digits is enough to ensure that a (reasonable) date and
  time can be stored without roundoff error.</p>

  <p>If the current precision is greater than 12, date forms will
  keep additional digits in the seconds position. For example, if
  the precision is 15, the seconds will keep three digits after the
  decimal point. Decreasing the precision below 12 may cause the
  time part of a date form to become inaccurate. This can also
  happen if astronomically high years are used, though this will
  not be an issue in everyday (or even everymillennium) use. Note
  that date forms without times are stored as exact integers, so
  roundoff is never an issue for them.</p>

  <p>You can use the <kbd>v p</kbd> (<code>calc-pack</code>) and
  <kbd>v u</kbd> (<code>calc-unpack</code>) commands to get at the
  numerical representation of a date form. See <a href=
  "Packing-and-Unpacking.html#Packing-and-Unpacking">Packing and
  Unpacking</a>.</p>

  <p>Date forms can go arbitrarily far into the future or past.
  Negative year numbers represent years BC. There is no &ldquo;year
  0&rdquo;; the day before &lsquo;<samp>&lt;Mon Jan 1,
  +1&gt;</samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp>&lt;Sun Dec 31,
  -1&gt;</samp>&rsquo;. These are days 1 and 0 respectively in
  Calc&rsquo;s internal numbering scheme. The Gregorian calendar is
  used for all dates, including dates before the Gregorian calendar
  was invented (although that can be configured; see below). Thus
  Calc&rsquo;s use of the day number <i>-10000</i> to represent
  August 15, 28 BC should be taken with a grain of
  salt.</p><a name="index-Julian-calendar" id=
  "index-Julian-calendar"></a> <a name="index-Gregorian-calendar"
  id="index-Gregorian-calendar"></a>

  <p>Some historical background: The Julian calendar was created by
  Julius Caesar in the year 46 BC as an attempt to fix the
  confusion caused by the irregular Roman calendar that was used
  before that time. The Julian calendar introduced an extra day in
  all years divisible by four. After some initial confusion, the
  calendar was adopted around the year we call 8 AD. Some centuries
  later it became apparent that the Julian year of 365.25 days was
  itself not quite right. In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII introduced the
  Gregorian calendar, which added the new rule that years divisible
  by 100, but not by 400, were not to be considered leap years
  despite being divisible by four. Many countries delayed adoption
  of the Gregorian calendar because of religious differences. For
  example, Great Britain and the British colonies switched to the
  Gregorian calendar in September 1752, when the Julian calendar
  was eleven days behind the Gregorian calendar. That year in
  Britain, the day after September 2 was September 14. To take
  another example, Russia did not adopt the Gregorian calendar
  until 1918, and that year in Russia the day after January 31 was
  February 14. Calc&rsquo;s reckoning therefore matches English
  practice starting in 1752 and Russian practice starting in 1918,
  but disagrees with earlier dates in both countries.</p>

  <p>When the Julian calendar was introduced, it had January 1 as
  the first day of the year. By the Middle Ages, many European
  countries had changed the beginning of a new year to a different
  date, often to a religious festival. Almost all countries
  reverted to using January 1 as the beginning of the year by the
  time they adopted the Gregorian calendar.</p>

  <p>Some calendars attempt to mimic the historical situation by
  using the Gregorian calendar for recent dates and the Julian
  calendar for older dates. The <code>cal</code> program in most
  Unix implementations does this, for example. While January 1
  wasn&rsquo;t always the beginning of a calendar year, these
  hybrid calendars still use January 1 as the beginning of the year
  even for older dates. The customizable variable
  <code>calc-gregorian-switch</code> (see <a href=
  "Customizing-Calc.html#Customizing-Calc">Customizing Calc</a>)
  can be set to have Calc&rsquo;s date forms switch from the Julian
  to Gregorian calendar at any specified date.</p>

  <p>Today&rsquo;s timekeepers introduce an occasional &ldquo;leap
  second&rdquo;. These do not occur regularly and Calc does not
  take these minor effects into account. (If it did, it would have
  to report a non-integer number of days between, say,
  &lsquo;<samp>&lt;12:00am Mon Jan 1, 1900&gt;</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>&lt;12:00am Sat Jan 1,
  2000&gt;</samp>&rsquo;.)</p><a name="index-Julian-day-counting"
  id="index-Julian-day-counting"></a>

  <p>Another day counting system in common use is, confusingly,
  also called &ldquo;Julian.&rdquo; Julian days go from noon to
  noon. The Julian day number is the numbers of days since 12:00
  noon (GMT) on November 24, 4714 BC in the Gregorian calendar
  (i.e., January 1, 4713 BC in the Julian calendar). In
  Calc&rsquo;s scheme (in GMT) the Julian day origin is
  <i>-1721422.5</i>, because Calc starts at midnight instead of
  noon. Thus to convert a Calc date code obtained by unpacking a
  date form into a Julian day number, simply add 1721422.5 after
  compensating for the time zone difference. The built-in <kbd>t
  J</kbd> command performs this conversion for you.</p>

  <p>The Julian day number is based on the Julian cycle, which was
  invented in 1583 by Joseph Justus Scaliger. Scaliger named it the
  Julian cycle since it involves the Julian calendar, but some have
  suggested that Scaliger named it in honor of his father, Julius
  Caesar Scaliger. The Julian cycle is based on three other cycles:
  the indiction cycle, the Metonic cycle, and the solar cycle. The
  indiction cycle is a 15 year cycle originally used by the Romans
  for tax purposes but later used to date medieval documents. The
  Metonic cycle is a 19 year cycle; 19 years is close to being a
  common multiple of a solar year and a lunar month, and so every
  19 years the phases of the moon will occur on the same days of
  the year. The solar cycle is a 28 year cycle; the Julian calendar
  repeats itself every 28 years. The smallest time period which
  contains multiples of all three cycles is the least common
  multiple of 15 years, 19 years and 28 years, which (since
  they&rsquo;re pairwise relatively prime) is 15*19*28 = 7980
  years. This is the length of a Julian cycle. Working backwards,
  the previous year in which all three cycles began was 4713 BC,
  and so Scaliger chose that year as the beginning of a Julian
  cycle. Since at the time there were no historical records from
  before 4713 BC, using this year as a starting point had the
  advantage of avoiding negative year numbers. In 1849, the
  astronomer John Herschel (son of William Herschel) suggested
  using the number of days since the beginning of the Julian cycle
  as an astronomical dating system; this idea was taken up by other
  astronomers. (At the time, noon was the start of the astronomical
  day. Herschel originally suggested counting the days since Jan 1,
  4713 BC at noon Alexandria time; this was later amended to noon
  GMT.) Julian day numbering is largely used in
  astronomy.</p><a name="index-Unix-time-format" id=
  "index-Unix-time-format"></a>

  <p>The Unix operating system measures time as an integer number
  of seconds since midnight, Jan 1, 1970. To convert a Calc date
  value into a Unix time stamp, first subtract 719163 (the code for
  &lsquo;<samp>&lt;Jan 1, 1970&gt;</samp>&rsquo;), then multiply by
  86400 (the number of seconds in a day) and press <kbd>R</kbd> to
  round to the nearest integer. If you have a date form, you can
  simply subtract the day &lsquo;<samp>&lt;Jan 1,
  1970&gt;</samp>&rsquo; instead of unpacking and subtracting
  719163. Likewise, divide by 86400 and add &lsquo;<samp>&lt;Jan 1,
  1970&gt;</samp>&rsquo; to convert from Unix time to a Calc date
  form. (Note that Unix normally maintains the time in the GMT time
  zone; you may need to subtract five hours to get New York time,
  or eight hours for California time. The same is usually true of
  Julian day counts.) The built-in <kbd>t U</kbd> command performs
  these conversions.</p>
