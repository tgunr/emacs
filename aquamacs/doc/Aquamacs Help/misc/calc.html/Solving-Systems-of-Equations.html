  <h4 class="subsection">10.6.2 Solving Systems of
  Equations</h4><a name="index-Systems-of-equations_002c-symbolic"
  id="index-Systems-of-equations_002c-symbolic"></a>

  <p>You can also use the commands described above to solve systems
  of simultaneous equations. Just create a vector of equations,
  then specify a vector of variables for which to solve. (You can
  omit the surrounding brackets when entering the vector of
  variables at the prompt.)</p>

  <p>For example, putting &lsquo;<samp>[x + y = a, x - y =
  b]</samp>&rsquo; on the stack and typing <kbd>a S x,y
  <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> produces the vector of
  solutions &lsquo;<samp>[x = a - (a-b)/2, y =
  (a-b)/2]</samp>&rsquo;. The result vector will have the same
  length as the variables vector, and the variables will be listed
  in the same order there. Note that the solutions are not always
  simplified as far as possible; the solution for
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; here could be improved by an
  application of the <kbd>a n</kbd> command.</p>

  <p>Calc&rsquo;s algorithm works by trying to eliminate one
  variable at a time by solving one of the equations for that
  variable and then substituting into the other equations. Calc
  will try all the possibilities, but you can speed things up by
  noting that Calc first tries to eliminate the first variable with
  the first equation, then the second variable with the second
  equation, and so on. It also helps to put the simpler (e.g., more
  linear) equations toward the front of the list. Calc&rsquo;s
  algorithm will solve any system of linear equations, and also
  many kinds of nonlinear systems.</p><a name="index-elim" id=
  "index-elim"></a>

  <p>Normally there will be as many variables as equations. If you
  give fewer variables than equations (an
  &ldquo;over-determined&rdquo; system of equations), Calc will
  find a partial solution. For example, typing <kbd>a S y
  <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> with the above system of
  equations would produce &lsquo;<samp>[y = a - x]</samp>&rsquo;.
  There are now several ways to express this solution in terms of
  the original variables; Calc uses the first one that it finds.
  You can control the choice by adding variable specifiers of the
  form &lsquo;<samp>elim(<var>v</var>)</samp>&rsquo; to the
  variables list. This says that <var>v</var> should be eliminated
  from the equations; the variable will not appear at all in the
  solution. For example, typing <kbd>a S y,elim(x)</kbd> would
  yield &lsquo;<samp>[y = a - (b+a)/2]</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If the variables list contains only <code>elim</code>
  specifiers, Calc simply eliminates those variables from the
  equations and then returns the resulting set of equations. For
  example, <kbd>a S elim(x)</kbd> produces &lsquo;<samp>[a - 2 y =
  b]</samp>&rsquo;. Every variable eliminated will reduce the
  number of equations in the system by one.</p>

  <p>Again, <kbd>a S</kbd> gives you one solution to the system of
  equations. If there are several solutions, you can use <kbd>H a
  S</kbd> to get a general family of solutions, or, if there is a
  finite number of solutions, you can use <kbd>a P</kbd> to get a
  list. (In the latter case, the result will take the form of a
  matrix where the rows are different solutions and the columns
  correspond to the variables you requested.)</p>

  <p>Another way to deal with certain kinds of overdetermined
  systems of equations is the <kbd>a F</kbd> command, which does
  least-squares fitting to satisfy the equations. See <a href=
  "Curve-Fitting.html#Curve-Fitting">Curve Fitting</a>.</p>
