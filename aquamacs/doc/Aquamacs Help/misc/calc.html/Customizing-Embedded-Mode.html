  <h3 class="section">16.5 Customizing Embedded Mode</h3>

  <p>You can modify Embedded mode&rsquo;s behavior by setting
  various Lisp variables described here. These variables are
  customizable (see <a href=
  "Customizing-Calc.html#Customizing-Calc">Customizing Calc</a>),
  or you can use <kbd>M-x set-variable</kbd> or <kbd>M-x
  edit-options</kbd> to adjust a variable on the fly. (Another
  possibility would be to use a file-local variable annotation at
  the end of the file; see <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">
  Local Variables in Files</a> in <cite>the Emacs manual</cite>.)
  Many of the variables given mentioned here can be set to depend
  on the major mode of the editing buffer (see <a href=
  "Customizing-Calc.html#Customizing-Calc">Customizing
  Calc</a>).</p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dformula" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dformula"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-embedded-open-formula</code> variable holds a
  regular expression for the opening delimiter of a formula. See
  <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Regexp-Search.html#Regexp-Search">
  Regular Expression Search</a> in <cite>the Emacs manual</cite>,
  to see how regular expressions work. Basically, a regular
  expression is a pattern that Calc can search for. A regular
  expression that considers blank lines,
  &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>$$</samp>&rsquo;
  to be opening delimiters is <code>"\\`\\|^\n\\|\\$\\$?"</code>.
  Just in case the meaning of this regular expression is not
  completely plain, let&rsquo;s go through it in detail.</p>

  <p>The surrounding &lsquo;<samp>" "</samp>&rsquo; marks quote the
  text between them as a Lisp string. If you left them off,
  <code>set-variable</code> or <code>edit-options</code> would try
  to read the regular expression as a Lisp program.</p>

  <p>The most obvious property of this regular expression is that
  it contains indecently many backslashes. There are actually two
  levels of backslash usage going on here. First, when Lisp reads a
  quoted string, all pairs of characters beginning with a backslash
  are interpreted as special characters. Here, <code>\n</code>
  changes to a new-line character, and <code>\\</code> changes to a
  single backslash. So the actual regular expression seen by Calc
  is &lsquo;<samp>\`\|^ <span class="roman">(newline)</span>
  \|\$\$?</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Regular expressions also consider pairs beginning with
  backslash to have special meanings. Sometimes the backslash is
  used to quote a character that otherwise would have a special
  meaning in a regular expression, like
  &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo;, which normally means
  &ldquo;end-of-line,&rdquo; or &lsquo;<samp>?</samp>&rsquo;, which
  means that the preceding item is optional. So
  &lsquo;<samp>\$\$?</samp>&rsquo; matches either one or two dollar
  signs.</p>

  <p>The other codes in this regular expression are
  &lsquo;<samp>^</samp>&rsquo;, which matches
  &ldquo;beginning-of-line,&rdquo; &lsquo;<samp>\|</samp>&rsquo;,
  which means &ldquo;or,&rdquo; and &lsquo;<samp>\`</samp>&rsquo;,
  which matches &ldquo;beginning-of-buffer.&rdquo; So the whole
  pattern means that a formula begins at the beginning of the
  buffer, or on a newline that occurs at the beginning of a line
  (i.e., a blank line), or at one or two dollar signs.</p>

  <p>The default value of <code>calc-embedded-open-formula</code>
  looks just like this example, with several more alternatives
  added on to recognize various other common kinds of
  delimiters.</p>

  <p>By the way, the reason to use &lsquo;<samp>^\n</samp>&rsquo;
  rather than &lsquo;<samp>^$</samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp>\n\n</samp>&rsquo;, which also would appear to match
  blank lines, is that the former expression actually
  &ldquo;consumes&rdquo; only one newline character as <em>part
  of</em> the delimiter, whereas the latter expressions consume
  zero or two newlines, respectively. The former choice gives the
  most natural behavior when Calc must operate on a whole formula
  including its delimiters.</p>

  <p>See the Emacs manual for complete details on regular
  expressions. But just for your convenience, here is a list of all
  characters which must be quoted with backslash (like
  &lsquo;<samp>\$</samp>&rsquo;) to avoid some special
  interpretation: &lsquo;<samp>. * + ? [ ] ^ $ \</samp>&rsquo;.
  (Note the backslash in this list; for example, to match
  &lsquo;<samp>\[</samp>&rsquo; you must use
  <code>"\\\\\\["</code>. An exercise for the reader is to account
  for each of these six backslashes!)</p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dformula" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dformula"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-embedded-close-formula</code> variable holds a
  regular expression for the closing delimiter of a formula. A
  closing regular expression to match the above example would be
  <code>"\\'\\|\n$\\|\\$\\$?"</code>. This is almost the same as
  the other one, except it now uses &lsquo;<samp>\'</samp>&rsquo;
  (&ldquo;end-of-buffer&rdquo;) and &lsquo;<samp>\n$</samp>&rsquo;
  (newline occurring at end of line, yet another way of describing
  a blank line that is more appropriate for this case).</p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dword_002dregexp" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dword_002dregexp"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-embedded-word-regexp</code> variable holds a
  regular expression used to define an expression to look for (a
  &ldquo;word&rdquo;) when you type <kbd>C-x * w</kbd> to enable
  Embedded mode.</p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dplain" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dplain"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-embedded-open-plain</code> variable is a string
  which begins a &ldquo;plain&rdquo; formula written in front of
  the formatted formula when <kbd>d p</kbd> mode is turned on. Note
  that this is an actual string, not a regular expression, because
  Calc must be able to write this string into a buffer as well as
  to recognize it. The default string is <code>"%%% "</code> (note
  the trailing space), but may be different for certain major
  modes.</p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dplain"
  id="index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dplain"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-embedded-close-plain</code> variable is a
  string which ends a &ldquo;plain&rdquo; formula. The default is
  <code>" %%%\n"</code>, but may be different for different major
  modes. Without the trailing newline here, the first line of a Big
  mode formula that followed might be shifted over with respect to
  the other lines.</p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dnew_002dformula" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dnew_002dformula"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-embedded-open-new-formula</code> variable is a
  string which is inserted at the front of a new formula when you
  type <kbd>C-x * f</kbd>. Its default value is
  <code>"\n\n"</code>. If this string begins with a newline
  character and the <kbd>C-x * f</kbd> is typed at the beginning of
  a line, <kbd>C-x * f</kbd> will skip this first newline to avoid
  introducing unnecessary blank lines in the file.</p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dnew_002dformula" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dnew_002dformula"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-embedded-close-new-formula</code> variable is
  the corresponding string which is inserted at the end of a new
  formula. Its default value is also <code>"\n\n"</code>. The final
  newline is omitted by <kbd><span class=
  "nolinebreak">C-x</span>&nbsp;*&nbsp;f</kbd><!-- /@w --> if typed
  at the end of a line. (It follows that if <kbd>C-x * f</kbd> is
  typed on a blank line, both a leading opening newline and a
  trailing closing newline are omitted.)</p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dannounce_002dformula" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dannounce_002dformula"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-embedded-announce-formula</code> variable is a
  regular expression which is sure to be followed by an embedded
  formula. The <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> command searches for this pattern
  as well as for &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>:=</samp>&rsquo; operators. Note that <kbd>C-x *
  a</kbd> will not activate just anything surrounded by formula
  delimiters; after all, blank lines are considered formula
  delimiters by default! But if your language includes a delimiter
  which can only occur actually in front of a formula, you can take
  advantage of it here. The default pattern is <code>"%Embed\n\\(%
  .*\n\\)*"</code>, but may be different for different major modes.
  This pattern will check for &lsquo;<samp>%Embed</samp>&rsquo;
  followed by any number of lines beginning with
  &lsquo;<samp>%</samp>&rsquo; and a space. This last is important
  to make Calc consider mode annotations part of the pattern, so
  that the formula&rsquo;s opening delimiter really is sure to
  follow the pattern.</p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dmode" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dmode"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-embedded-open-mode</code> variable is a string
  (not a regular expression) which should precede a mode
  annotation. Calc never scans for this string; Calc always looks
  for the annotation itself. But this is the string that is
  inserted before the opening bracket when Calc adds an annotation
  on its own. The default is <code>"% "</code>, but may be
  different for different major modes.</p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dmode" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dmode"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-embedded-close-mode</code> variable is a string
  which follows a mode annotation written by Calc. Its default
  value is simply a newline, <code>"\n"</code>, but may be
  different for different major modes. If you change this, it is a
  good idea still to end with a newline so that mode annotations
  will appear on lines by themselves.</p>
