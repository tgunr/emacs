  <h4 class="subsection">10.11.3 Conditional Rewrite Rules</h4>

  <p>A rewrite rule can also be <em>conditional</em>, written in
  the form &lsquo;<samp><var>old</var> := <var>new</var> ::
  <var>cond</var></samp>&rsquo;. (There is also the obsolete form
  &lsquo;<samp>[<var>old</var>, <var>new</var>,
  <var>cond</var>]</samp>&rsquo;.) If a <var>cond</var> part is
  present in the rule, this is an additional condition that must be
  satisfied before the rule is accepted. Once <var>old</var> has
  been successfully matched to the target expression,
  <var>cond</var> is evaluated (with all the meta-variables
  substituted for the values they matched) and simplified with
  Calc&rsquo;s algebraic simplifications. If the result is a
  nonzero number or any other object known to be nonzero (see
  <a href="Declarations.html#Declarations">Declarations</a>), the
  rule is accepted. If the result is zero or if it is a symbolic
  formula that is not known to be nonzero, the rule is rejected.
  See <a href="Logical-Operations.html#Logical-Operations">Logical
  Operations</a>, for a number of functions that return 1 or 0
  according to the results of various tests.</p>

  <p>For example, the formula &lsquo;<samp>n &gt; 0</samp>&rsquo;
  simplifies to 1 or 0 if &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; is replaced
  by a positive or nonpositive number, respectively (or if
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; has been declared to be positive or
  nonpositive). Thus, the rule &lsquo;<samp>f(x,y) := g(y+x,x) ::
  x+y &gt; 0</samp>&rsquo; would apply to &lsquo;<samp>f(0,
  4)</samp>&rsquo; but not to &lsquo;<samp>f(-3, 2)</samp>&rsquo;
  or &lsquo;<samp>f(12, a+1)</samp>&rsquo; (assuming no outstanding
  declarations for &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;). In the case of
  &lsquo;<samp>f(-3, 2)</samp>&rsquo;, the condition can be shown
  not to be satisfied; in the case of &lsquo;<samp>f(12,
  a+1)</samp>&rsquo;, the condition merely cannot be shown to be
  satisfied, but that is enough to reject the rule.</p>

  <p>While Calc will use declarations to reason about variables in
  the formula being rewritten, declarations do not apply to
  meta-variables. For example, the rule &lsquo;<samp>f(a) :=
  g(a+1)</samp>&rsquo; will match for any values of
  &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, such as complex numbers, vectors,
  or formulas, even if &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; has been
  declared to be real or scalar. If you want the meta-variable
  &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; to match only literal real numbers,
  use &lsquo;<samp>f(a) := g(a+1) :: real(a)</samp>&rsquo;. If you
  want &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; to match only reals and
  formulas which are provably real, use
  &lsquo;<samp>dreal(a)</samp>&rsquo; as the condition.</p>

  <p>The &lsquo;<samp>::</samp>&rsquo; operator is a shorthand for
  the <code>condition</code> function; &lsquo;<samp><var>old</var>
  := <var>new</var> :: <var>cond</var></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent
  to the formula &lsquo;<samp>condition(assign(<var>old</var>,
  <var>new</var>), <var>cond</var>)</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If you have several conditions, you can use &lsquo;<samp>...
  :: c1 :: c2 :: c3</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>... :: c1
  &amp;&amp; c2 &amp;&amp; c3</samp>&rsquo;. The two are entirely
  equivalent.</p>

  <p>It is also possible to embed conditions inside the pattern:
  &lsquo;<samp>f(x :: x&gt;0, y) := g(y+x, x)</samp>&rsquo;. This
  is purely a notational convenience, though; where a condition
  appears in a rule has no effect on when it is tested. The
  rewrite-rule compiler automatically decides when it is best to
  test each condition while a rule is being matched.</p>

  <p>Certain conditions are handled as special cases by the rewrite
  rule system and are tested very efficiently: Where
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is any meta-variable, these
  conditions are &lsquo;<samp>integer(x)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>real(x)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>constant(x)</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>negative(x)</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>x &gt;=
  y</samp>&rsquo; where &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo; is either a
  constant or another meta-variable and
  &lsquo;<samp>&gt;=</samp>&rsquo; may be replaced by any of the
  six relational operators, and &lsquo;<samp>x % a =
  b</samp>&rsquo; where &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo; are constants. Other conditions,
  like &lsquo;<samp>x &gt;= y+1</samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp>dreal(x)</samp>&rsquo;, will be less efficient to
  check since Calc must bring the whole evaluator and simplifier
  into play.</p>

  <p>An interesting property of &lsquo;<samp>::</samp>&rsquo; is
  that neither of its arguments will be touched by Calc&rsquo;s
  default simplifications. This is important because conditions
  often are expressions that cannot safely be evaluated early. For
  example, the <code>typeof</code> function never remains in
  symbolic form; entering &lsquo;<samp>typeof(a)</samp>&rsquo; will
  put the number 100 (the type code for variables like
  &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;) on the stack. But putting the
  condition &lsquo;<samp>... :: typeof(a) = 6</samp>&rsquo; on the
  stack is safe since &lsquo;<samp>::</samp>&rsquo; prevents the
  <code>typeof</code> from being evaluated until the condition is
  actually used by the rewrite system.</p>

  <p>Since &lsquo;<samp>::</samp>&rsquo; protects its lefthand
  side, too, you can use a dummy condition to protect a rule that
  must itself not evaluate early. For example, it&rsquo;s not safe
  to put &lsquo;<samp>a(f,x) := apply(f, [x])</samp>&rsquo; on the
  stack because it will immediately evaluate to &lsquo;<samp>a(f,x)
  := f(x)</samp>&rsquo;, where the meta-variable-ness of
  <code>f</code> on the righthand side has been lost. But
  &lsquo;<samp>a(f,x) := apply(f, [x]) :: 1</samp>&rsquo; is safe,
  and of course the condition &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; is
  always true (nonzero) so it has no effect on the functioning of
  the rule. (The rewrite compiler will ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t
  even impact the speed of matching the rule.)</p>
