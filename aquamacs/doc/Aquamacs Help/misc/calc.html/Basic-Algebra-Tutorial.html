  <h4 class="subsection">2.5.1 Basic Algebra</h4>

  <p>If you enter a formula in Algebraic mode that refers to
  variables, the formula itself is pushed onto the stack. You can
  manipulate formulas as regular data objects.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  2 x^2 - 6       1:  6 - 2 x^2       1:  (3 x^2 + y) (6 - 2 x^2)
    .                   .                   .

    ' 2x^2-6 <span class=
"key">RET</span>        n                   ' 3x^2+y <span class=
"key">RET</span> *
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Do <kbd>' x <span class=
  "key">RET</span> Q 2 ^</kbd> and <kbd>' x <span class=
  "key">RET</span> 2 ^ Q</kbd> both wind up with the same result
  (&lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;)? Why or why not? See <a href=
  "Algebra-Answer-1.html#Algebra-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>There are also commands for doing common algebraic operations
  on formulas. Continuing with the formula from the last
  example,</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  18 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 6 y - 2 y x^2    1:  (18 - 2 y) x^2 - 6 x^4 + 6 y
    .                                     .

    a x                                   a c x <span class=
"key">RET</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>First we &ldquo;expand&rdquo; using the distributive law, then
  we &ldquo;collect&rdquo; terms involving like powers of
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s find the value of this expression when
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is 2 and
  &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo; is one-half.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3      1:  -25
    .                           .

    1:2 s l y <span class=
"key">RET</span>               2 s l x <span class="key">RET</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <kbd>s l</kbd> command means &ldquo;let&rdquo;; it takes a
  number from the top of the stack and temporarily assigns it as
  the value of the variable you specify. It then evaluates (as if
  by the <kbd>=</kbd> key) the next expression on the stack. After
  this command, the variable goes back to its original value, if
  any.</p>

  <p>(An earlier exercise in this tutorial involved storing a value
  in the variable <code>x</code>; if this value is still there, you
  will have to unstore it with <kbd>s u x <span class=
  "key">RET</span></kbd> before the above example will work
  properly.)</p><a name=
  "index-Maximum-of-a-function-using-Calculus" id=
  "index-Maximum-of-a-function-using-Calculus"></a>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s find the maximum value of our original expression
  when &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo; is one-half and
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; ranges over all possible values. We
  can do this by taking the derivative with respect to
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; and examining values of
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; for which the derivative is zero. If
  the second derivative of the function at that value of
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is negative, the function has a
  local maximum there.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3      1:  34 x - 24 x^3
    .                           .

    U <span class=
"key">DEL</span>  s 1                  a d x <span class=
"key">RET</span>   s 2
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Well, the derivative is clearly zero when
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is zero. To find the other root(s),
  let&rsquo;s divide through by &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; and
  then solve:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  (34 x - 24 x^3) / x    1:  34 - 24 x^2
    .                          .

    ' x <span class="key">RET</span> /                  a x

</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  0.70588 x^2 = 1        1:  x = 1.19023
    .                          .

    0 a =  s 3                 a S x <span class="key">RET</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Now we compute the second derivative and plug in our values of
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  1.19023        2:  1.19023         2:  1.19023
    .              1:  34 x - 24 x^3   1:  34 - 72 x^2
                       .                   .

    a .                r 2                 a d x <span class=
"key">RET</span> s 4
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(The <kbd>a .</kbd> command extracts just the righthand side
  of an equation. Another method would have been to use <kbd>v
  u</kbd> to unpack the equation
  &lsquo;<samp>x&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.19</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> to
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>1.19</samp>&rsquo;,
  then use <kbd>M-- M-2 <span class="key">DEL</span></kbd> to
  delete the &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  34 - 72 x^2   1:  -68.         2:  34 - 72 x^2     1:  34
1:  1.19023           .            1:  0                   .
    .                                  .

    <span class="key">TAB</span>               s l x <span class=

"key">DEL</span> 0             s l x <span class="key">RET</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The first of these second derivatives is negative, so we know
  the function has a maximum value at &lsquo;<samp>x =
  1.19023</samp>&rsquo;. (The function also has a local
  <em>minimum</em> at &lsquo;<samp>x = 0</samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  <p>When we solved for &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;, we got only
  one value even though &lsquo;<samp>0.70588 x^2 = 1</samp>&rsquo;
  is a quadratic equation that ought to have two solutions. The
  reason is that <kbd>a&nbsp;S</kbd><!-- /@w --> normally returns a
  single &ldquo;principal&rdquo; solution. If it needs to come up
  with an arbitrary sign (as occurs in the quadratic formula) it
  picks &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo;. If it needs an arbitrary
  integer, it picks zero. We can get a full solution by pressing
  <kbd>H</kbd> (the Hyperbolic flag) before <kbd>a S</kbd>.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  0.70588 x^2 = 1    1:  x = 1.19023 s1      1:  x = -1.19023
    .                      .                       .

    r 3                    H a S x <span class=
"key">RET</span>  s 5        1 n  s l s1 <span class=
"key">RET</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Calc has invented the variable &lsquo;<samp>s1</samp>&rsquo;
  to represent an unknown sign; it is supposed to be either
  <i>+1</i> or <i>-1</i>. Here we have used the &ldquo;let&rdquo;
  command to evaluate the expression when the sign is negative. If
  we plugged this into our second derivative we would get the same,
  negative, answer, so &lsquo;<samp>x = -1.19023</samp>&rsquo; is
  also a maximum.</p>

  <p>To find the actual maximum value, we must plug our two values
  of &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; into the original formula.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3    1:  24.08333 s1^2 - 12.04166 s1^4 + 3
1:  x = 1.19023 s1            .
    .

    r 1 r 5                   s l <span class="key">RET</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(Here we see another way to use <kbd>s l</kbd>; if its input
  is an equation with a variable on the lefthand side, then <kbd>s
  l</kbd> treats the equation like an assignment to that variable
  if you don&rsquo;t give a variable name.)</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s clear that this will have the same value for either
  sign of <code>s1</code>, but let&rsquo;s work it out anyway, just
  for the exercise:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  [-1, 1]              1:  [15.04166, 15.04166]
1:  24.08333 s1^2 ...        .
    .

  [ 1 n , 1 ] <span class=
"key">TAB</span>            V M $ <span class="key">RET</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here we have used a vector mapping operation to evaluate the
  function at several values of &lsquo;<samp>s1</samp>&rsquo; at
  once. <kbd>V M $</kbd> is like <kbd>V M '</kbd> except that it
  takes the formula from the top of the stack. The formula is
  interpreted as a function to apply across the vector at the
  next-to-top stack level. Since a formula on the stack can&rsquo;t
  contain &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; signs, Calc assumes the
  variables in the formula stand for different arguments. It
  prompts you for an <em>argument list</em>, giving the list of all
  variables in the formula in alphabetical order as the default
  list. In this case the default is
  &lsquo;<samp>(s1)</samp>&rsquo;, which is just what we want so we
  simply press <tt class="key">RET</tt> at the prompt.</p>

  <p>If there had been several different values, we could have used
  <kbd>V&nbsp;R&nbsp;X</kbd><!-- /@w --> to find the global
  maximum.</p>

  <p>Calc has a built-in <kbd>a P</kbd> command that solves an
  equation using <kbd>H&nbsp;a&nbsp;S</kbd><!-- /@w --> and returns
  a vector of all the solutions. It simply automates the job we
  just did by hand. Applied to our original cubic polynomial, it
  would produce the vector of solutions &lsquo;<samp>[1.19023,
  -1.19023, 0]</samp>&rsquo;. (There is also an <kbd>a X</kbd>
  command which finds a local maximum of a function. It uses a
  numerical search method rather than examining the derivatives,
  and thus requires you to provide some kind of initial guess to
  show it where to look.)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Given a vector of the
  roots of a polynomial (such as the output of an <kbd>a P</kbd>
  command), what sequence of commands would you use to reconstruct
  the original polynomial? (The answer will be unique to within a
  constant multiple; choose the solution where the leading
  coefficient is one.) See <a href=
  "Algebra-Answer-2.html#Algebra-Answer-2">2</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>The <kbd>m s</kbd> command enables Symbolic mode, in which
  formulas like &lsquo;<samp>sqrt(5)</samp>&rsquo; that can&rsquo;t
  be evaluated exactly are left in symbolic form rather than giving
  a floating-point approximate answer. Fraction mode (<kbd>m
  f</kbd>) is also useful when doing algebra.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  34 x - 24 x^3        2:  34 x - 24 x^3
1:  34 x - 24 x^3        1:  [sqrt(51) / 6, sqrt(51) / -6, 0]

  <p>One more mode that makes reading formulas easier is Big
  mode.</p>

  TeX mode and LaTeX mode.</p>

  <p>As you can see, language modes affect both entry and display
  of formulas. They affect such things as the names used for
  built-in functions, the set of arithmetic operators and their
  precedences, and notations for vectors and matrices.</p>

  <p>Notice that &lsquo;<samp>sqrt(51)</samp>&rsquo; may cause
  problems with older implementations of C and FORTRAN, which would
  require something more like
  &lsquo;<samp>sqrt(51.0)</samp>&rsquo;. It is always wise to check
  over the formulas produced by the various language modes to make
  sure they are fully correct.</p>

  <p>Type <kbd>m s</kbd>, <kbd>m f</kbd>, and <kbd>d N</kbd> to
  reset these modes. (You may prefer to remain in Big mode, but all
  the examples in the tutorial are shown in normal
  mode.)</p><a name="index-Area-under-a-curve" id=
  "index-Area-under-a-curve"></a>

  <p>What is the area under the portion of this curve from
  &lsquo;<samp>x = 1</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>2</samp>&rsquo;?
  This is simply the integral of the function:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3     1:  5.6666 x^3 - 1.2 x^5 + 3 x

  <p>We want to evaluate this at our two values for
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; and subtract. One way to do it is
  again with vector mapping and reduction:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Find the integral from 1

  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>Calc&rsquo;s integrator can do many simple integrals
  symbolically, but many others are beyond its capabilities.
  Suppose we wish to find the area under the curve
  &lsquo;<samp>sin(x) ln(x)</samp>&rsquo; over the same range of
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;. If you entered this formula and
  typed <kbd>a i x <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> (don&rsquo;t
  bother to try this), Calc would work for a long time but would be
  unable to find a solution. In fact, there is no closed-form
  solution to this integral. Now what do we do?</p><a name=
  "index-Integration_002c-numerical" id=
  "index-Integration_002c-numerical"></a> <a name=
  "index-Numerical-integration" id=
  "index-Numerical-integration"></a>

  <p>One approach would be to do the integral numerically. It is
  not hard to do this by hand using vector mapping and reduction.
  It is rather slow, though, since the sine and logarithm functions
  take a long time. We can save some time by reducing the working
  precision.</p>

  <p>(If you got wildly different results, did you remember to

  <p>Here we have divided the curve into ten segments of equal
  width; approximating these segments as rectangular boxes (i.e.,
  assuming the curve is nearly flat at that resolution), we compute
  the areas of the boxes (height times width), then sum the areas.
  (It is faster to sum first, then multiply by the width, since the
  width is the same for every box.)</p>

  <p>The true value of this integral turns out to be about 0.374,
  so we&rsquo;re not doing too well. Let&rsquo;s try another
  approach.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  ln(x) sin(x)    1:  0.84147 x + 0.11957 (x - 1)^2 - ...

  <p>Here we have computed the Taylor series expansion of the
  function about the point &lsquo;<samp>x=1</samp>&rsquo;. We can
  now integrate this polynomial approximation, since polynomials
  are easy to integrate.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  0.42074 x^2 + ...    1:  [-0.0446, -0.42073]      1:  0.3761

  </div>

  <p>Better! By increasing the precision and/or asking for more
  terms in the Taylor series, we can get a result as accurate as we
  like. (Taylor series converge better away from singularities in
  the function such as the one at <code>ln(0)</code>, so it would
  also help to expand the series about the points
  &lsquo;<samp>x=2</samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp>x=1.5</samp>&rsquo; instead of
  &lsquo;<samp>x=1</samp>&rsquo;.)</p><a name=

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Our first method
  approximated the curve by stairsteps of width 0.1; the total area
  was then the sum of the areas of the rectangles under these
  stairsteps. Our second method approximated the function by a
  polynomial, which turned out to be a better approximation than
  stairsteps. A third method is <em>Simpson&rsquo;s rule</em>,
  which is like the stairstep method except that the steps are not
  required to be flat. Simpson&rsquo;s rule boils down to the
  formula,</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(h/3) * (f(a) + 4 f(a+h) + 2 f(a+2h) + 4 f(a+3h) + ...
              + 2 f(a+(n-2)*h) + 4 f(a+(n-1)*h) + f(a+n*h))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>where &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; (which must be even) is the
  number of slices and &lsquo;<samp>h</samp>&rsquo; is the width of
  each slice. These are 10 and 0.1 in our example. For reference,
  here is the corresponding formula for the stairstep method:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
h * (f(a) + f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + f(a+3h) + ...
          + f(a+(n-2)*h) + f(a+(n-1)*h))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Compute the integral from 1 to 2 of &lsquo;<samp>sin(x)
  ln(x)</samp>&rsquo; using Simpson&rsquo;s rule with 10 slices.
  See <a href="Algebra-Answer-4.html#Algebra-Answer-4">4</a>.

  <p>Calc has a built-in <kbd>a I</kbd> command for doing numerical
  integration. It uses <em>Romberg&rsquo;s method</em>, which is a
  more sophisticated cousin of Simpson&rsquo;s rule. In particular,
  it knows how to keep refining the result until the current
  precision is satisfied.</p>

  <p>Aside from the commands we&rsquo;ve seen so far, Calc also
  provides a large set of commands for operating on parts of
  formulas. You indicate the desired sub-formula by placing the
  cursor on any part of the formula before giving a
  <em>selection</em> command. Selections won&rsquo;t be covered in
  the tutorial; see <a href=
  "Selecting-Subformulas.html#Selecting-Subformulas">Selecting
  Subformulas</a>, for details and examples.</p>
