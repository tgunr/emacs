  <h3 class="section">2.6 Programming Tutorial</h3>

  <p>The Calculator is written entirely in Emacs Lisp, a highly
  extensible language. If you know Lisp, you can program the
  Calculator to do anything you like. Rewrite rules also work as a
  powerful programming system. But Lisp and rewrite rules take a
  while to master, and often all you want to do is define a new
  function or repeat a command a few times. Calc has features that
  allow you to do these things easily.</p>

  <p>One very limited form of programming is defining your own
  functions. Calc&rsquo;s <kbd>Z F</kbd> command allows you to
  define a function name and key sequence to correspond to any
  formula. Programming commands use the shift-<kbd>Z</kbd> prefix;
  the user commands they create use the lower case <kbd>z</kbd>
  prefix.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  x + x^2 / 2 + x^3 / 6 + 1         1:  x + x^2 / 2 + x^3 / 6 + 1
    .                                     .

    ' 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! <span class=
"key">RET</span>         Z F e myexp <span class=
"key">RET</span> <span class="key">RET</span> <span class=
"key">RET</span> y
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This polynomial is a Taylor series approximation to
  &lsquo;<samp>exp(x)</samp>&rsquo;. The <kbd>Z F</kbd> command
  asks a number of questions. The above answers say that the key
  sequence for our function should be <kbd>z e</kbd>; the
  <kbd>M-x</kbd> equivalent should be <code>calc-myexp</code>; the
  name of the function in algebraic formulas should also be
  <code>myexp</code>; the default argument list
  &lsquo;<samp>(x)</samp>&rsquo; is acceptable; and finally
  <kbd>y</kbd> answers the question &ldquo;leave it in symbolic
  form for non-constant arguments?&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  1.3495     2:  1.3495     3:  1.3495
    .          1:  1.34986    2:  1.34986
                   .          1:  myexp(a + 1)
                                  .

    .3 z e         .3 E           ' a+1 <span class=
"key">RET</span> z e
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>First we call our new <code>exp</code> approximation with 0.3
  as an argument, and compare it with the true <code>exp</code>
  function. Then we note that, as requested, if we try to give
  <kbd>z e</kbd> an argument that isn&rsquo;t a plain number, it
  leaves the <code>myexp</code> function call in symbolic form. If
  we had answered <kbd>n</kbd> to the final question,
  &lsquo;<samp>myexp(a + 1)</samp>&rsquo; would have evaluated by
  plugging in &lsquo;<samp>a + 1</samp>&rsquo; for
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; in the defining formula.</p><a name=
  "index-Sine-integral-Si_0028x_0029" id=
  "index-Sine-integral-Si_0028x_0029"></a> <a name="index-Si" id=
  "index-Si"></a>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> The &ldquo;sine
  integral&rdquo; function &lsquo;<samp>Si(x)</samp>&rsquo; is
  defined as the integral of &lsquo;<samp>sin(t)/t</samp>&rsquo;
  for &lsquo;<samp>t = 0</samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; in radians. (It was invented because
  this integral has no solution in terms of basic functions; if you
  give it to Calc&rsquo;s <kbd>a i</kbd> command, it will ponder it
  for a long time and then give up.) We can use the numerical
  integration command, however, which in algebraic notation is
  written like &lsquo;<samp>ninteg(f(t), t, 0, x)</samp>&rsquo;
  with any integrand &lsquo;<samp>f(t)</samp>&rsquo;. Define a
  <kbd>z s</kbd> command and <code>Si</code> function that
  implement this. You will need to edit the default argument list a
  bit. As a test, &lsquo;<samp>Si(1)</samp>&rsquo; should return
  0.946083. (If you don&rsquo;t get this answer, you might want to
  check that Calc is in Radians mode. Also, <code>ninteg</code>
  will run a lot faster if you reduce the precision to, say, six
  digits beforehand.) See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-1.html#Programming-Answer-1">1</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>The simplest way to do real &ldquo;programming&rdquo; of Emacs
  is to define a <em>keyboard macro</em>. A keyboard macro is
  simply a sequence of keystrokes which Emacs has stored away and
  can play back on demand. For example, if you find yourself typing
  <kbd>H a S x <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> often, you may
  wish to program a keyboard macro to type this for you.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  y = sqrt(x)          1:  x = y^2
    .                        .

    ' y=sqrt(x) <span class=
"key">RET</span>       C-x ( H a S x <span class=
"key">RET</span> C-x )

1:  y = cos(x)           1:  x = s1 arccos(y) + 2 n1 pi
    .                        .

    ' y=cos(x) <span class="key">RET</span>           X
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>When you type <kbd>C-x (</kbd>, Emacs begins recording. But it
  is also still ready to execute your keystrokes, so you&rsquo;re
  really &ldquo;training&rdquo; Emacs by walking it through the
  procedure once. When you type <kbd><span class=
  "nolinebreak">C-x</span>&nbsp;)</kbd><!-- /@w -->, the macro is
  recorded. You can now type <kbd>X</kbd> to re-execute the same
  keystrokes.</p>

  <p>You can give a name to your macro by typing <kbd>Z
  K</kbd>.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  .              1:  y = x^4         1:  x = s2 sqrt(s1 sqrt(y))
                       .                   .

  Z K x <span class=
"key">RET</span>            ' y=x^4 <span class="key">RET</span>         z x
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Notice that we use shift-<kbd>Z</kbd> to define the command,
  and lower-case <kbd>z</kbd> to call it up.</p>

  <p>Keyboard macros can call other macros.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  abs(x)        1:  x = s1 y                1:  2 / x    1:  x = 2 / y
    .                 .                           .            .

 ' abs(x) <span class="key">RET</span>   C-x ( ' y <span class=
"key">RET</span> a = z x C-x )    ' 2/x <span class=
"key">RET</span>       X
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Define a keyboard macro
  to negate the item in level 3 of the stack, without disturbing
  the rest of the stack. See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-2.html#Programming-Answer-2">2</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Define keyboard macros
  to compute the following functions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Compute &lsquo;<samp>sin(x) / x</samp>&rsquo;, where
    &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is the number on the top of the
    stack.</li>

    <li>Compute the base-&lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo; logarithm,
    just like the <kbd>B</kbd> key except the arguments are taken
    in the opposite order.</li>

    <li>Produce a vector of integers from 1 to the integer on the
    top of the stack.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-3.html#Programming-Answer-3">3</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Define a keyboard macro
  to compute the average (mean) value of a list of numbers. See
  <a href="Programming-Answer-4.html#Programming-Answer-4">4</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>In many programs, some of the steps must execute several
  times. Calc has <em>looping</em> commands that allow this. Loops
  are useful inside keyboard macros, but actually work at any
  time.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  x^6          2:  x^6        1: 360 x^2
    .            1:  4             .
                     .

  ' x^6 <span class=
"key">RET</span>          4         Z &lt; a d x <span class=
"key">RET</span> Z &gt;
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here we have computed the fourth derivative of
  &lsquo;<samp>x^6</samp>&rsquo; by enclosing a derivative command
  in a &ldquo;repeat loop&rdquo; structure. This structure pops a
  repeat count from the stack, then executes the body of the loop
  that many times.</p>

  <p>If you make a mistake while entering the body of the loop,
  type <kbd>Z&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">C-g</span></kbd>
  <!-- /@w --> to cancel the loop command.</p><a name=
  "index-Fibonacci-numbers-1" id="index-Fibonacci-numbers-1"></a>

  <p>Here&rsquo;s another example:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
3:  1               2:  10946
2:  1               1:  17711
1:  20                  .
    .

1 <span class="key">RET</span> <span class=
"key">RET</span> 20       Z &lt; <span class=
"key">TAB</span> C-j + Z &gt;
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The numbers in levels 2 and 1 should be the 21st and 22nd
  Fibonacci numbers, respectively. (To see what&rsquo;s going on,
  try a few repetitions of the loop body by hand; <kbd>C-j</kbd>,
  also on the Line-Feed or <tt class="key">LFD</tt> key if you have
  one, makes a copy of the number in level 2.)</p><a name=
  "index-Golden-ratio" id="index-Golden-ratio"></a> <a name=
  "index-Phi_002c-golden-ratio" id=
  "index-Phi_002c-golden-ratio"></a>

  <p>A fascinating property of the Fibonacci numbers is that the
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;th Fibonacci number can be found
  directly by computing &lsquo;<samp>phi^n / sqrt(5)</samp>&rsquo;
  and then rounding to the nearest integer, where
  &lsquo;<samp>phi</samp>&rsquo;, the &ldquo;golden ratio,&rdquo;
  is &lsquo;<samp>(1 + sqrt(5)) / 2</samp>&rsquo;. (For
  convenience, this constant is available from the <code>phi</code>
  variable, or the <kbd>I H P</kbd> command.)</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  1.61803         1:  24476.0000409    1:  10945.9999817    1:  10946
    .                   .                    .                    .

    I H P               21 ^                 5 Q /                R
</pre>
  </div><a name="index-Continued-fractions" id=
  "index-Continued-fractions"></a>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 5.</strong> The <em>continued
  fraction</em> representation of &lsquo;<samp>phi</samp>&rsquo; is
  &lsquo;<samp>1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/( ... )))</samp>&rsquo;. We can
  compute an approximate value by carrying this however far and
  then replacing the innermost &lsquo;<samp>1/( ... )</samp>&rsquo;
  by 1. Approximate &lsquo;<samp>phi</samp>&rsquo; using a
  twenty-term continued fraction. See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-5.html#Programming-Answer-5">5</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 6.</strong> Linear recurrences like
  the one for Fibonacci numbers can be expressed in terms of
  matrices. Given a vector &lsquo;<samp>[a,&nbsp;b]</samp>&rsquo;
  <!-- /@w --> determine a matrix which, when multiplied by this
  vector, produces the vector &lsquo;<samp>[b, c]</samp>&rsquo;,
  where &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;
  and &lsquo;<samp>c</samp>&rsquo; are three successive Fibonacci
  numbers. Now write a program that, given an integer
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;, computes the
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;th Fibonacci number using matrix
  arithmetic. See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-6.html#Programming-Answer-6">6</a>.
  (&bull;)</p><a name="index-Harmonic-numbers" id=
  "index-Harmonic-numbers"></a>

  <p>A more sophisticated kind of loop is the <em>for</em> loop.
  Suppose we wish to compute the 20th &ldquo;harmonic&rdquo;
  number, which is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the
  integers from 1 to 20.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
3:  0               1:  3.597739
2:  1                   .
1:  20
    .

0 <span class="key">RET</span> 1 <span class=
"key">RET</span> 20         Z ( &amp; + 1 Z )
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop pops two numbers, the lower and
  upper limits, then repeats the body of the loop as an internal
  counter increases from the lower limit to the upper one. Just
  before executing the loop body, it pushes the current loop
  counter. When the loop body finishes, it pops the
  &ldquo;step,&rdquo; i.e., the amount by which to increment the
  loop counter. As you can see, our loop always uses a step of
  one.</p>

  <p>This harmonic number function uses the stack to hold the
  running total as well as for the various loop housekeeping
  functions. If you find this disorienting, you can sum in a
  variable instead:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  0         2:  1                  .            1:  3.597739
    .         1:  20                                  .
                  .

    0 t 7       1 <span class=
"key">RET</span> 20      Z ( &amp; s + 7 1 Z )       r 7
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <kbd>s +</kbd> command adds the top-of-stack into the
  value in a variable (and removes that value from the stack).</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that many jobs that call for a
  &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop can also be done more easily by
  Calc&rsquo;s high-level operations. Two other ways to compute
  harmonic numbers are to use vector mapping and reduction (<kbd>v
  x 20</kbd>, then <kbd>V&nbsp;M&nbsp;&amp;</kbd><!-- /@w -->, then
  <kbd>V R +</kbd>), or to use the summation command <kbd>a
  +</kbd>. Both of these are probably easier than using loops.
  However, there are some situations where loops really are the way
  to go:</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 7.</strong> Use a &ldquo;for&rdquo;
  loop to find the first harmonic number which is greater than 4.0.
  See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-7.html#Programming-Answer-7">7</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>Of course, if we&rsquo;re going to be using variables in our
  programs, we have to worry about the programs clobbering values
  that the caller was keeping in those same variables. This is easy
  to fix, though:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
    .        1:  0.6667       1:  0.6667     3:  0.6667
                 .                .          2:  3.597739
                                             1:  0.6667
                                                 .

   Z `    p 4 <span class="key">RET</span> 2 <span class=
"key">RET</span> 3 /   s 7 s s a <span class=
"key">RET</span>    Z '  r 7 s r a <span class="key">RET</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>When we type <kbd>Z `</kbd> (that&rsquo;s a grave accent),
  Calc saves its mode settings and the contents of the ten
  &ldquo;quick variables&rdquo; for later reference. When we type
  <kbd>Z '</kbd> (that&rsquo;s an apostrophe now), Calc restores
  those saved values. Thus the <kbd>p 4</kbd> and <kbd>s 7</kbd>
  commands have no effect outside this sequence. Wrapping this
  around the body of a keyboard macro ensures that it doesn&rsquo;t
  interfere with what the user of the macro was doing. Notice that
  the contents of the stack, and the values of named variables,
  survive past the <kbd>Z '</kbd> command.</p><a name=
  "index-Bernoulli-numbers_002c-approximate" id=
  "index-Bernoulli-numbers_002c-approximate"></a>

  <p>The <em>Bernoulli numbers</em> are a sequence with the
  interesting property that all of the odd Bernoulli numbers are
  zero, and the even ones, while difficult to compute, can be
  roughly approximated by the formula &lsquo;<samp>2 n! / (2
  pi)^n</samp>&rsquo;. Let&rsquo;s write a keyboard macro to
  compute (approximate) Bernoulli numbers. (Calc has a command,
  <kbd>k b</kbd>, to compute exact Bernoulli numbers, but this
  command is very slow for large &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; since
  the higher Bernoulli numbers are very large fractions.)</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  10               1:  0.0756823

  <p>You can read <kbd>Z [</kbd> as &ldquo;then,&rdquo; <kbd>Z
  :</kbd> as &ldquo;else,&rdquo; and <kbd>Z ]</kbd> as
  &ldquo;end-if.&rdquo; There is no need for an explicit
  &ldquo;if&rdquo; command. For the purposes of <kbd>Z&nbsp;[</kbd>
  <!-- /@w -->, the condition is &ldquo;true&rdquo; if the value it
  pops from the stack is a nonzero number, or &ldquo;false&rdquo;
  if it pops zero or something that is not a number (like a
  formula). Here we take our integer argument modulo 2; this will
  be nonzero if we&rsquo;re asking for an odd Bernoulli number.</p>

  <p>The actual tenth Bernoulli number is
  &lsquo;<samp>5/66</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Just to exercise loops a bit more, let&rsquo;s compute a table
  of even Bernoulli numbers.</p>

  <p>The vertical-bar <kbd>|</kbd> is the vector-concatenation
  command. When we execute it, the list we are building will be in
  stack level 2 (initially this is an empty list), and the next
  Bernoulli number will be in level 1. The effect is to append the
  Bernoulli number onto the end of the list. (To create a table of
  exact fractional Bernoulli numbers, just replace <kbd>X</kbd>
  with <kbd>k b</kbd> in the above sequence of keystrokes.)</p>

  <p>With loops and conditionals, you can program essentially
  anything in Calc. One other command that makes looping easier is
  <kbd>Z /</kbd>, which takes a condition from the stack and breaks
  out of the enclosing loop if the condition is true (non-zero).
  You can use this to make &ldquo;while&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;until&rdquo; style loops.</p>

  <p>If you make a mistake when entering a keyboard macro, you can
  edit it using <kbd>Z E</kbd>. First, you must attach it to a key
  with <kbd>Z K</kbd>. One technique is to enter a throwaway dummy
  definition for the macro, then enter the real one in the edit
  command.</p>

  along the macro and tries to decode it back into human-readable

  are also ignored when the edited macro is saved. To enter a space
  into the macro, type <code>SPC</code>. All the special characters
  <code>RET</code>, <code>LFD</code>, <code>TAB</code>,

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 8.</strong> A general algorithm for
  solving equations numerically is <em>Newton&rsquo;s Method</em>.
  Given the equation &lsquo;<samp>f(x) = 0</samp>&rsquo; for any
  function &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;, and an initial guess
  &lsquo;<samp>x_0</samp>&rsquo; which is reasonably close to the

  <div class="example">

  </div>

  <p>where &lsquo;<samp>f'(x)</samp>&rsquo; is the derivative of
  &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;. The &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;
  values will quickly converge to a solution, i.e., eventually
  &lsquo;<samp>new_x</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;
  will be equal to within the limits of the current precision.
  Write a program which takes a formula involving the variable

  &lsquo;<samp>x_0</samp>&rsquo;, on the stack, and produces a

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 9.</strong> The <em>digamma</em>
  function &lsquo;<samp>psi(z)</samp>&rsquo; is defined as the
  derivative of &lsquo;<samp>ln(gamma(z))</samp>&rsquo;. For large
  values of &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo;, it can be approximated by
  the infinite sum</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
psi(z) ~= ln(z) - 1/2z - sum(bern(2 n) / 2 n z^(2 n), n, 1, inf)

  <p>where &lsquo;<samp>sum</samp>&rsquo; represents the sum over
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; from 1 to infinity (or to some limit
  high enough to give the desired accuracy), and the
  <code>bern</code> function produces (exact) Bernoulli numbers.
  While this sum is not guaranteed to converge, in practice it is
  safe. An interesting mathematical constant is Euler&rsquo;s
  gamma, which is equal to about 0.5772. One way to compute it is
  by the formula, &lsquo;<samp>gamma = -psi(1)</samp>&rsquo;.
  Unfortunately, 1 isn&rsquo;t a large enough argument for the
  above formula to work (5 is a much safer value for
  &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo;). Fortunately, we can compute
  &lsquo;<samp>psi(1)</samp>&rsquo; from
  &lsquo;<samp>psi(5)</samp>&rsquo; using the recurrence
  &lsquo;<samp>psi(z+1) = psi(z) + 1/z</samp>&rsquo;. Your task:
  Develop a program to compute &lsquo;<samp>psi(z)</samp>&rsquo;;
  it should &ldquo;pump up&rdquo; &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo; if
  necessary to be greater than 5, then use the above summation
  formula. Use looping commands to compute the sum. Use your
  function to compute &lsquo;<samp>gamma</samp>&rsquo; to twelve
  decimal places. (Calc has a built-in command for Euler&rsquo;s
  constant, <kbd>I P</kbd>, which you can use to check your
  answer.) See <a href=

  produce the list &lsquo;<samp>[1, 2, 1, 0, 5, 0,

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 11.</strong> The <em>Stirling
  numbers of the first kind</em> are defined by the
  recurrences,</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
s(n,n) = 1   for n &gt;= 0,

</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This can be implemented using a <em>recursive</em> program in
  Calc; the program must invoke itself in order to calculate the
  two righthand terms in the general formula. Since it always
  invokes itself with &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; arguments, it&rsquo;s
  easy to see that it must eventually finish the computation.
  Recursion is a little difficult with Emacs keyboard macros since
  the macro is executed before its definition is complete. So
  here&rsquo;s the recommended strategy: Create a &ldquo;dummy
  macro&rdquo; and assign it to a key with, e.g., <kbd>Z K s</kbd>.
  Now enter the true definition, using the <kbd>z s</kbd> command
  to call itself recursively, then assign it to the same key with
  <kbd>Z K s</kbd>. Now the <kbd>z s</kbd> command will run the
  complete recursive program. (Another way is to use
  <kbd>Z&nbsp;E</kbd><!-- /@w -->
   or <kbd>C-x * m</kbd> (<code>read-kbd-macro</code>) to read the
  whole macro at once, thus avoiding the &ldquo;training&rdquo;
  phase.) The task: Write a program that computes Stirling numbers
  of the first kind, given &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>m</samp>&rsquo; on the stack. Test it with
  <em>small</em> inputs like &lsquo;<samp>s(4,2)</samp>&rsquo;.

  <p>The programming commands we&rsquo;ve seen in this part of the
  tutorial are low-level, general-purpose operations. Often you
  will find that a higher-level function, such as vector mapping or
  rewrite rules, will do the job much more easily than a detailed,
  step-by-step program can:</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 12.</strong> Write another program
  for computing Stirling numbers of the first kind, this time using
  rewrite rules. Once again, &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>m</samp>&rsquo; should be taken from the stack. See
