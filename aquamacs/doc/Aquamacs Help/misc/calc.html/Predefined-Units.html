  <h3 class="section">11.3 Predefined Units</h3>

  <p>The definitions of many units have changed over the years. For
  example, the meter was originally defined in 1791 as one
  ten-millionth of the distance from the Equator to the North Pole.
  In order to be more precise, the definition was adjusted several
  times, and now a meter is defined as the distance that light will
  travel in a vacuum in 1/299792458 of a second; consequently, the
  speed of light in a vacuum is exactly 299792458 m/s. Many other
  units have been redefined in terms of fundamental physical
  processes; a second, for example, is currently defined as
  9192631770 periods of a certain radiation related to the
  cesium-133 atom. The only SI unit that is not based on a
  fundamental physical process (although there are efforts to
  change this) is the kilogram, which was originally defined as the
  mass of one liter of water, but is now defined as the mass of the
  international prototype of the kilogram (IPK), a cylinder of
  platinum-iridium kept at the Bureau international des poids et
  mesures in S&Atilde;&uml;vres, France. (There are several copies
  of the IPK throughout the world.) The British imperial units,
  once defined in terms of physical objects, were redefined in 1963
  in terms of SI units. The US customary units, which were the same
  as British units until the British imperial system was created in
  1824, were also defined in terms of the SI units in 1893. Because
  of these redefinitions, conversions between metric, British
  Imperial, and US customary units can often be done precisely.</p>

  <p>Since the exact definitions of many kinds of units have
  evolved over the years, and since certain countries sometimes
  have local differences in their definitions, it is a good idea to
  examine Calc&rsquo;s definition of a unit before depending on its
  exact value. For example, there are three different units for
  gallons, corresponding to the US (<code>gal</code>), Canadian
  (<code>galC</code>), and British (<code>galUK</code>)
  definitions. Also, note that <code>oz</code> is a standard ounce
  of mass, <code>ozt</code> is a Troy ounce, and <code>ozfl</code>
  is a fluid ounce.</p>

  <p>The temperature units corresponding to degrees Kelvin and
  Centigrade (Celsius) are the same in this table, since most units
  commands treat temperatures as being relative. The
  <code>calc-convert-temperature</code> command has special rules
  for handling the different absolute magnitudes of the various
  temperature scales.</p>

  <p>The unit of volume &ldquo;liters&rdquo; can be referred to by
  either the lower-case <code>l</code> or the upper-case
  <code>L</code>.</p>

  <p>The unit <code>A</code> stands for amperes; the name
  <code>Ang</code> is used for angstroms.</p>

  <p>The unit <code>pt</code> stands for pints; the name
  <code>point</code> stands for a typographical point, defined by
  &lsquo;<samp>72 point = 1 in</samp>&rsquo;. This is slightly
  different than the point defined by the American
  Typefounder&rsquo;s Association in 1886, but the point used by
  Calc has become standard largely due to its use by the PostScript
  page description language. There is also <code>texpt</code>,
  which stands for a printer&rsquo;s point as defined by the TeX
  typesetting system: &lsquo;<samp>72.27 texpt = 1
  in</samp>&rsquo;. Other units used by TeX are available; they are
  <code>texpc</code> (a pica), <code>texbp</code> (a &ldquo;big
  point&rdquo;, equal to a standard point which is larger than the
  point used by TeX), <code>texdd</code> (a Didot point),
  <code>texcc</code> (a Cicero) and <code>texsp</code> (a scaled
  TeX point, all dimensions representable in TeX are multiples of
  this value).</p>

  <p>When Calc is using the TeX or LaTeX language mode (see
  <a href="TeX-and-LaTeX-Language-Modes.html#TeX-and-LaTeX-Language-Modes">
  TeX and LaTeX Language Modes</a>), the TeX specific unit names
  will not use the &lsquo;<samp>tex</samp>&rsquo; prefix; the unit
  name for a TeX point will be &lsquo;<samp>pt</samp>&rsquo;
  instead of &lsquo;<samp>texpt</samp>&rsquo;, for example. To
  avoid conflicts, the unit names for pint and parsec will simply
  be &lsquo;<samp>pint</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>parsec</samp>&rsquo; instead of
  &lsquo;<samp>pt</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>pc</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The unit <code>e</code> stands for the elementary (electron)
  unit of charge; because algebra command could mistake this for
  the special constant &lsquo;<samp>e</samp>&rsquo;, Calc provides
  the alternate unit name <code>ech</code> which is preferable to
  <code>e</code>.</p>

  <p>The name <code>g</code> stands for one gram of mass; there is
  also <code>gf</code>, one gram of force. (Likewise for
  <kbd>lb</kbd>, pounds, and <kbd>lbf</kbd>.) Meanwhile, one
  &ldquo;&lsquo;<samp>g</samp>&rsquo;&rdquo; of acceleration is
  denoted <code>ga</code>.</p>

  <p>The unit <code>ton</code> is a U.S. ton of &lsquo;<samp>2000
  lb</samp>&rsquo;, and <code>t</code> is a metric ton of
  &lsquo;<samp>1000 kg</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The names <code>s</code> (or <code>sec</code>) and
  <code>min</code> refer to units of time; <code>arcsec</code> and
  <code>arcmin</code> are units of angle.</p>

  <p>Some &ldquo;units&rdquo; are really physical constants; for
  example, <code>c</code> represents the speed of light, and
  <code>h</code> represents Planck&rsquo;s constant. You can use
  these just like other units: converting &lsquo;<samp>.5
  c</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>m/s</samp>&rsquo; expresses
  one-half the speed of light in meters per second. You can also
  use this merely as a handy reference; the <kbd>u g</kbd> command
  gets the definition of one of these constants in its normal
  terms, and <kbd>u b</kbd> expresses the definition in base
  units.</p>

  <p>Two units, <code>pi</code> and <code>alpha</code> (the fine
  structure constant, approximately <i>1/137</i>) are
  dimensionless. The units simplification commands simply treat
  these names as equivalent to their corresponding values. However
  you can, for example, use <kbd>u c</kbd> to convert a pure number
  into multiples of the fine structure constant, or <kbd>u b</kbd>
  to convert this back into a pure number. (When <kbd>u c</kbd>
  prompts for the &ldquo;old units,&rdquo; just enter a blank line
  to signify that the value really is unitless.)</p>
