  <h4 class="subsection">7.5.4 Time Zones</h4><a name=
  "index-Time-zones" id="index-Time-zones"></a> <a name=
  "index-Daylight-saving-time" id="index-Daylight-saving-time"></a>

  <p>Time zones and daylight saving time are a complicated
  business. The conversions to and from Julian and Unix-style dates
  automatically compute the correct time zone and daylight saving
  adjustment to use, provided they can figure out this information.
  This section describes Calc&rsquo;s time zone adjustment
  algorithm in detail, in case you want to do conversions in
  different time zones or in case Calc&rsquo;s algorithms
  can&rsquo;t determine the right correction to use.</p>

  <p>Adjustments for time zones and daylight saving time are done
  by <kbd>t U</kbd>, <kbd>t J</kbd>, <kbd>t N</kbd>, and <kbd>t
  C</kbd>, but not by any other commands. In particular,
  &lsquo;<samp>&lt;may 1 1991&gt; - &lt;apr 1
  1991&gt;</samp>&rsquo; evaluates to exactly 30 days even though
  there is a daylight-saving transition in between. This is also
  true for Julian pure dates: &lsquo;<samp>julian(&lt;may 1
  1991&gt;) - julian(&lt;apr 1 1991&gt;)</samp>&rsquo;. But Julian
  and Unix date/times will adjust for daylight saving time: using
  Calc&rsquo;s default daylight saving time rule (see the
  explanation below), &lsquo;<samp>julian(&lt;12am may 1 1991&gt;)
  - julian(&lt;12am apr 1 1991&gt;)</samp>&rsquo; evaluates to
  &lsquo;<samp>29.95833</samp>&rsquo; (that&rsquo;s 29 days and 23
  hours) because one hour was lost when daylight saving commenced
  on April 7, 1991.</p>

  <p>In brief, the idiom &lsquo;<samp>julian(<var>date1</var>) -
  julian(<var>date2</var>)</samp>&rsquo; computes the actual number
  of 24-hour periods between two dates, whereas
  &lsquo;<samp><var>date1</var> - <var>date2</var></samp>&rsquo;
  computes the number of calendar days between two dates without
  taking daylight saving into account.</p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dtime_002dzone" id=
  "index-calc_002dtime_002dzone"></a> <a name="index-tzone" id=
  "index-tzone"></a>

  <p>The <code>calc-time-zone</code> [<code>tzone</code>] command
  converts the time zone specified by its numeric prefix argument
  into a number of seconds difference from Greenwich mean time
  (GMT). If the argument is a number, the result is simply that
  value multiplied by 3600. Typical arguments for North America are
  5 (Eastern) or 8 (Pacific). If Daylight Saving time is in effect,
  one hour should be subtracted from the normal difference.</p>

  <p>If you give a prefix of plain <kbd>C-u</kbd>,
  <code>calc-time-zone</code> (like other date arithmetic commands
  that include a time zone argument) takes the zone argument from
  the top of the stack. (In the case of <kbd>t J</kbd> and <kbd>t
  U</kbd>, the normal argument is then taken from the second-to-top
  stack position.) This allows you to give a non-integer time zone
  adjustment. The time-zone argument can also be an HMS form, or it
  can be a variable which is a time zone name in upper- or
  lower-case. For example &lsquo;<samp>tzone(PST) =
  tzone(8)</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>tzone(pdt) =
  tzone(7)</samp>&rsquo; (for Pacific standard and daylight saving
  times, respectively).</p>

  <p>North American and European time zone names are defined as
  follows; note that for each time zone there is one name for
  standard time, another for daylight saving time, and a third for
  &ldquo;generalized&rdquo; time in which the daylight saving
  adjustment is computed from context.</p>

</pre>
  </div><a name="index-math_002dtzone_002dnames" id=
  "index-math_002dtzone_002dnames"></a>

  <p>To define time zone names that do not appear in the above
  table, you must modify the Lisp variable
  <code>math-tzone-names</code>. This is a list of lists describing
  the different time zone names; its structure is best explained by
  an example. The three entries for Pacific Time look like
  this:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
( ( "PST" 8 0 )    ; Name as an upper-case string, then standard
  ( "PDT" 8 -1 )   ; adjustment, then daylight saving adjustment.
  ( "PGT" 8 "PST" "PDT" ) )   ; Generalized time zone.
</pre>
  </div><a name="index-TimeZone-variable" id=
  "index-TimeZone-variable"></a> <a name="index-TimeZone" id=
  "index-TimeZone"></a>

  <p>With no arguments, <code>calc-time-zone</code> or
  &lsquo;<samp>tzone()</samp>&rsquo; will by default get the time
  zone and daylight saving information from the calendar (see
  <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Daylight-Saving.html#Daylight-Saving">
  The Calendar and the Diary</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs
  Manual</cite>). To use a different time zone, or if the calendar
  does not give the desired result, you can set the Calc variable
  <code>TimeZone</code> (which is by default <code>nil</code>) to
  an appropriate time zone name. (The easiest way to do this is to
  edit the <code>TimeZone</code> variable using Calc&rsquo;s <kbd>s
  T</kbd> command, then use the <kbd>s p</kbd>
  (<code>calc-permanent-variable</code>) command to save the value
  of <code>TimeZone</code> permanently.) If the time zone given by
  <code>TimeZone</code> is a generalized time zone, e.g.,
  <code>EGT</code>, Calc examines the date being converted to tell
  whether to use standard or daylight saving time. But if the
  current time zone is explicit, e.g., <code>EST</code> or
  <code>EDT</code>, then that adjustment is used exactly and
  Calc&rsquo;s daylight saving algorithm is not consulted. The
  special time zone name <code>local</code> is equivalent to no
  argument; i.e., it uses the information obtained from the
  calendar.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>t J</kbd> and <code>t U</code> commands with no
  numeric prefix arguments do the same thing as
  &lsquo;<samp>tzone()</samp>&rsquo;; namely, use the information
  from the calendar if <code>TimeZone</code> is <code>nil</code>,
  otherwise use the time zone given by
  <code>TimeZone</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-math_002ddaylight_002dsavings_002dhook" id=
  "index-math_002ddaylight_002dsavings_002dhook"></a> <a name=
  "index-math_002dstd_002ddaylight_002dsavings" id=
  "index-math_002dstd_002ddaylight_002dsavings"></a>

  <p>When Calc computes the daylight saving information itself
  (i.e., when the <code>TimeZone</code> variable is set), it will
  by default consider daylight saving time to begin at 2 a.m. on
  the second Sunday of March (for years from 2007 on) or on the
  last Sunday in April (for years before 2007), and to end at 2
  a.m. on the first Sunday of November. (for years from 2007 on) or
  the last Sunday in October (for years before 2007). These are the
  rules that have been in effect in much of North America since
  1966 and take into account the rule change that began in 2007. If
  you are in a country that uses different rules for computing
  daylight saving time, you have two choices: Write your own
  daylight saving hook, or control time zones explicitly by setting
  the <code>TimeZone</code> variable and/or always giving a
  time-zone argument for the conversion functions.</p>

  <p>The Lisp variable <code>math-daylight-savings-hook</code>
  holds the name of a function that is used to compute the daylight
  saving adjustment for a given date. The default is
  <code>math-std-daylight-savings</code>, which computes an
  adjustment (either 0 or <i>-1</i>) using the North American rules
  given above.</p>

  <p>The daylight saving hook function is called with four
  arguments: The date, as a floating-point number in standard Calc
  format; a six-element list of the date decomposed into year,
  month, day, hour, minute, and second, respectively; a string
  which contains the generalized time zone name in upper-case,
  e.g., <code>"WEGT"</code>; and a special adjustment to be applied
  to the hour value when converting into a generalized time zone
  (see below).</p><a name=
  "index-math_002dprev_002dweekday_002din_002dmonth" id=
  "index-math_002dprev_002dweekday_002din_002dmonth"></a>

  <p>The Lisp function <code>math-prev-weekday-in-month</code> is
  useful for daylight saving computations. This is an internal
  version of the user-level <code>pwday</code> function described
  in the previous section. It takes four arguments: The
  floating-point date value, the corresponding six-element date
  list, the day-of-month number, and the weekday number
  (0&ndash;6).</p>

  <p>The default daylight saving hook ignores the time zone name,
  but a more sophisticated hook could use different algorithms for
  different time zones. It would also be possible to use different
  algorithms depending on the year number, but the default hook
  always uses the algorithm for 1987 and later. Here is a listing
  of the default daylight saving hook:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
(defun math-std-daylight-savings (date dt zone bump)
  (cond ((&lt; (nth 1 dt) 4) 0)
        ((= (nth 1 dt) 4)
         (let ((sunday (math-prev-weekday-in-month date dt 7 0)))
           (cond ((&lt; (nth 2 dt) sunday) 0)
                 ((= (nth 2 dt) sunday)
                  (if (&gt;= (nth 3 dt) (+ 3 bump)) -1 0))
                 (t -1))))
        ((&lt; (nth 1 dt) 10) -1)
        ((= (nth 1 dt) 10)
         (let ((sunday (math-prev-weekday-in-month date dt 31 0)))
           (cond ((&lt; (nth 2 dt) sunday) -1)
                 ((= (nth 2 dt) sunday)
                  (if (&gt;= (nth 3 dt) (+ 2 bump)) 0 -1))
                 (t 0))))
        (t 0))
)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <code>bump</code> parameter is equal to zero when Calc is
  converting from a date form in a generalized time zone into a GMT
  date value. It is <i>-1</i> when Calc is converting in the other
  direction. The adjustments shown above ensure that the conversion
  behaves correctly and reasonably around the 2 a.m. transition in
  each direction.</p>

  <p>There is a &ldquo;missing&rdquo; hour between 2 a.m. and 3
  a.m. at the beginning of daylight saving time; converting a
  date/time form that falls in this hour results in a time value
  for the following hour, from 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. At the end of
  daylight saving time, the hour from 1 a.m. to 2 a.m. repeats
  itself; converting a date/time form that falls in this hour
  results in a time value for the first manifestation of that time
  (<em>not</em> the one that occurs one hour later).</p>

  <p>If <code>math-daylight-savings-hook</code> is
  <code>nil</code>, then the daylight saving adjustment is always
  taken to be zero.</p>

  <p>In algebraic formulas, &lsquo;<samp>tzone(<var>zone</var>,
  <var>date</var>)</samp>&rsquo; computes the time zone adjustment
  for a given zone name at a given date. The <var>date</var> is
  ignored unless <var>zone</var> is a generalized time zone. If
  <var>date</var> is a date form, the daylight saving computation
  is applied to it as it appears. If <var>date</var> is a numeric
  date value, it is adjusted for the daylight-saving version of
  <var>zone</var> before being given to the daylight saving hook.
  This odd-sounding rule ensures that the daylight-saving
  computation is always done in local time, not in the GMT time
  that a numeric <var>date</var> is typically represented
  in.</p><a name="index-dsadj" id="index-dsadj"></a>

  <p>The &lsquo;<samp>dsadj(<var>date</var>,
  <var>zone</var>)</samp>&rsquo; function computes the daylight
  saving adjustment that is appropriate for <var>date</var> in time
  zone <var>zone</var>. If <var>zone</var> is explicitly in or not
  in daylight saving time (e.g., <code>PDT</code> or
  <code>PST</code>) the <var>date</var> is ignored. If
  <var>zone</var> is a generalized time zone, the algorithms
  described above are used. If <var>zone</var> is omitted, the
  computation is done for the current time zone.</p>
