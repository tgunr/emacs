  <h4 class="subsection">2.7.8 Modes Tutorial Exercise 1</h4>

  <p>Calc always stores its numbers in decimal, so even though
  one-third has an exact base-3 representation
  (&lsquo;<samp>3#0.1</samp>&rsquo;), it is still stored as
  0.3333333 (chopped off after 12 or however many decimal digits)
  inside the calculator&rsquo;s memory. When this inexact number is
  converted back to base 3 for display, it may still be slightly
  inexact. When we multiply this number by 3, we get 0.999999, also
  an inexact value.</p>

  <p>When Calc displays a number in base 3, it has to decide how
  many digits to show. If the current precision is 12 (decimal)
  digits, that corresponds to &lsquo;<samp>12 / log10(3) =
  25.15</samp>&rsquo; base-3 digits. Because 25.15 is not an exact
  integer, Calc shows only 25 digits, with the result that stored
  numbers carry a little bit of extra information that may not show
  up on the screen. When Joe entered
  &lsquo;<samp>3#0.2</samp>&rsquo;, the stored number 0.666666
  happened to round to a pleasing value when it lost that last 0.15
  of a digit, but it was still inexact in Calc&rsquo;s memory. When
  he divided by 2, he still got the dreaded inexact value 0.333333.
  (Actually, he divided 0.666667 by 2 to get 0.333334, which is why
  he got something a little higher than <code>3#0.1</code> instead
  of a little lower.)</p>

  <p>If Joe didn&rsquo;t want to be bothered with all this, he
  could have typed <kbd>M-24 d n</kbd> to display with one less
  digit than the default. (If you give <kbd>d n</kbd> a negative
  argument, it uses default-minus-that, so <kbd>M-- d n</kbd> would
  be an easier way to get the same effect.) Those inexact results
  would still be lurking there, but they would now be rounded to
  nice, natural-looking values for display purposes. (Remember,
  &lsquo;<samp>0.022222</samp>&rsquo; in base 3 is like
  &lsquo;<samp>0.099999</samp>&rsquo; in base 10; rounding off one
  digit will round the number up to
  &lsquo;<samp>0.1</samp>&rsquo;.) Depending on the nature of your
  work, this hiding of the inexactness may be a benefit or a
  danger. With the <kbd>d n</kbd> command, Calc gives you the
  choice.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, another consequence of all this is that if you
  type <kbd>M-30 d n</kbd> to display more digits than are
  &ldquo;really there,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll see garbage digits at
  the end of the number. (In decimal display mode, with
  decimally-stored numbers, these garbage digits are always zero so
  they vanish and you don&rsquo;t notice them.) Because Calc rounds
  off that 0.15 digit, there is the danger that two numbers could
  be slightly different internally but still look the same. If you
  feel uneasy about this, set the <kbd>d n</kbd> precision to be a
  little higher than normal; you&rsquo;ll get ugly garbage digits,
  but you&rsquo;ll always be able to tell two distinct numbers
  apart.</p>

  <p>An interesting side note is that most computers store their
  floating-point numbers in binary, and convert to decimal for
  display. Thus everyday programs have the same problem: Decimal
  0.1 cannot be represented exactly in binary (try it: <kbd>0.1 d
  2</kbd>), so &lsquo;<samp>0.1 * 10</samp>&rsquo; comes out as an
  inexact approximation to 1 on some machines (though they
  generally arrange to hide it from you by rounding off one digit
  as we did above). Because Calc works in decimal instead of
  binary, you can be sure that numbers that look exact <em>are</em>
  exact as long as you stay in decimal display mode.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s not hard to show that any number that can be
  represented exactly in binary, octal, or hexadecimal is also
  exact in decimal, so the kinds of problems we saw in this
  exercise are likely to be severe only when you use a relatively
  unusual radix like 3.</p>
