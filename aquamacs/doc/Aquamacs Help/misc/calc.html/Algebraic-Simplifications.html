  <h4 class="subsection">10.3.2 Algebraic
  Simplifications</h4><a name="index-Algebraic-simplifications" id=
  "index-Algebraic-simplifications"></a> <a name="index-a-s-1" id=
  "index-a-s-1"></a> <a name="index-m-A-1" id="index-m-A-1"></a>

  <p>This section describes all simplifications that are performed
  by the algebraic simplification mode, which is the default
  simplification mode. If you have switched to a different
  simplification mode, you can switch back with the <kbd>m A</kbd>
  command. Even in other simplification modes, the <kbd>a s</kbd>
  command will use these algebraic simplifications to simplify the
  formula.</p>

  <p>There is a variable, <code>AlgSimpRules</code>, in which you
  can put rewrites to be applied. Its use is analogous to
  <code>EvalRules</code>, but without the special restrictions.
  Basically, the simplifier does &lsquo;<samp>a&nbsp;r<!-- /@w -->
   AlgSimpRules</samp>&rsquo; with an infinite repeat count on the
  whole expression being simplified, then it traverses the
  expression applying the built-in rules described below. If the
  result is different from the original expression, the process
  repeats with the basic simplifications (including
  <code>EvalRules</code>), then <code>AlgSimpRules</code>, then the
  built-in simplifications, and so on.</p>

  <p>Sums are simplified in two ways. Constant terms are commuted
  to the end of the sum, so that &lsquo;<samp>a + 2 +
  b</samp>&rsquo; changes to &lsquo;<samp>a + b + 2</samp>&rsquo;.
  The only exception is that a constant will not be commuted away
  from the first position of a difference, i.e., &lsquo;<samp>2 -
  x</samp>&rsquo; is not commuted to &lsquo;<samp>-x +
  2</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Also, terms of sums are combined by the distributive law, as
  in &lsquo;<samp>x + y + 2 x</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>y + 3
  x</samp>&rsquo;. This always occurs for adjacent terms, but
  Calc&rsquo;s algebraic simplifications compare all pairs of terms
  including non-adjacent ones.</p>

  <p>Products are sorted into a canonical order using the
  commutative law. For example, &lsquo;<samp>b c a</samp>&rsquo; is
  commuted to &lsquo;<samp>a b c</samp>&rsquo;. This allows easier
  comparison of products; for example, the basic simplifications
  will not change &lsquo;<samp>x y + y x</samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp>2 x y</samp>&rsquo;, but the algebraic
  simplifications; it first rewrites the sum to &lsquo;<samp>x y +
  x y</samp>&rsquo; which can then be recognized as a sum of
  identical terms.</p>

  <p>The canonical ordering used to sort terms of products has the
  property that real-valued numbers, interval forms and infinities
  come first, and are sorted into increasing order. The <kbd>V
  S</kbd> command uses the same ordering when sorting a vector.</p>

  <p>Sorting of terms of products is inhibited when Matrix mode is
  turned on; in this case, Calc will never exchange the order of
  two terms unless it knows at least one of the terms is a
  scalar.</p>

  <p>Products of powers are distributed by comparing all pairs of
  terms, using the same method that the default simplifications use
  for adjacent terms of products.</p>

  <p>Even though sums are not sorted, the commutative law is still
  taken into account when terms of a product are being compared.
  Thus &lsquo;<samp>(x + y) (y + x)</samp>&rsquo; will be
  simplified to &lsquo;<samp>(x + y)^2</samp>&rsquo;. A subtle
  point is that &lsquo;<samp>(x - y) (y - x)</samp>&rsquo; will
  <em>not</em> be simplified to &lsquo;<samp>-(x -
  y)^2</samp>&rsquo;; Calc does not notice that one term can be
  written as a constant times the other, even if that constant is
  <i>-1</i>.</p>

  <p>A fraction times any expression, &lsquo;<samp>(a:b)
  x</samp>&rsquo;, is changed to a quotient involving integers:
  &lsquo;<samp>a x / b</samp>&rsquo;. This is not done for
  floating-point numbers like &lsquo;<samp>0.5</samp>&rsquo;,
  however. This is one reason why you may find it convenient to
  turn Fraction mode on while doing algebra; see <a href=
  "Fraction-Mode.html#Fraction-Mode">Fraction Mode</a>.</p>

  <p>Quotients are simplified by comparing all terms in the
  numerator with all terms in the denominator for possible
  cancellation using the distributive law. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp>a x^2 b / c x^3 d</samp>&rsquo; will cancel
  &lsquo;<samp>x^2</samp>&rsquo; from the top and bottom to get
  &lsquo;<samp>a b / c x d</samp>&rsquo;. (The terms in the
  denominator will then be rearranged to &lsquo;<samp>c d
  x</samp>&rsquo; as described above.) If there is any common
  integer or fractional factor in the numerator and denominator, it
  is canceled out; for example, &lsquo;<samp>(4 x + 6) / 8
  x</samp>&rsquo; simplifies to &lsquo;<samp>(2 x + 3) / 4
  x</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Non-constant common factors are not found even by algebraic
  simplifications. To cancel the factor
  &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<samp>(a x + a) /
  a^2</samp>&rsquo; you could first use <kbd>j M</kbd> on the
  product &lsquo;<samp>a x</samp>&rsquo; to Merge the numerator to
  &lsquo;<samp>a (1+x)</samp>&rsquo;, which can then be simplified
  successfully.</p>

  <p>Integer powers of the variable <code>i</code> are simplified
  according to the identity &lsquo;<samp>i^2 = -1</samp>&rsquo;. If
  you store a new value other than the complex number
  &lsquo;<samp>(0,1)</samp>&rsquo; in <code>i</code>, this
  simplification will no longer occur. This is not done by the
  basic simplifications; in case someone (unwisely) wants to use
  the name <code>i</code> for a variable unrelated to complex
  numbers, they can use basic simplification mode.</p>

  <p>Square roots of integer or rational arguments are simplified
  in several ways. (Note that these will be left unevaluated only
  in Symbolic mode.) First, square integer or rational factors are
  pulled out so that &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt>(8)</samp>&rsquo; is
  rewritten as &lsquo;<samp>2 sqrt(2)</samp>&rsquo;. Conceptually
  speaking this implies factoring the argument into primes and
  moving pairs of primes out of the square root, but for reasons of
  efficiency Calc only looks for primes up to 29.</p>

  <p>Square roots in the denominator of a quotient are moved to the
  numerator: &lsquo;<samp>1 / <tt>sqrt</tt>(3)</samp>&rsquo;
  changes to &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt>(3) / 3</samp>&rsquo;. The
  same effect occurs for the square root of a fraction:
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt>(2:3)</samp>&rsquo; changes to
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt>(6) / 3</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The <code>%</code> (modulo) operator is simplified in several
  ways when the modulus &lsquo;<samp>M</samp>&rsquo; is a positive
  real number. First, if the argument is of the form &lsquo;<samp>x
  + n</samp>&rsquo; for some real number
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;, then &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;
  is itself reduced modulo &lsquo;<samp>M</samp>&rsquo;. For
  example, &lsquo;<samp>(x - 23) % 10</samp>&rsquo; is simplified
  to &lsquo;<samp>(x + 7) % 10</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If the argument is multiplied by a constant, and this constant
  has a common integer divisor with the modulus, then this factor
  is canceled out. For example, &lsquo;<samp>12 x %
  15</samp>&rsquo; is changed to &lsquo;<samp>3 (4 x %
  5)</samp>&rsquo; by factoring out 3. Also, &lsquo;<samp>(12 x +
  1) % 15</samp>&rsquo; is changed to &lsquo;<samp>3 ((4 x + 1:3) %
  5)</samp>&rsquo;. While these forms may not seem
  &ldquo;simpler,&rdquo; they allow Calc to discover useful
  information about modulo forms in the presence of
  declarations.</p>

  <p>If the modulus is 1, then Calc can use <code>int</code>
  declarations to evaluate the expression. For example, the idiom
  &lsquo;<samp>x % 2</samp>&rsquo; is often used to check whether a
  number is odd or even. As described above,
  &lsquo;<samp>2&nbsp;n&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> and
  &lsquo;<samp>(2 n + 1) % 2</samp>&rsquo; are simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp>2 (n % 1)</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>2 ((n +
  1:2) % 1)</samp>&rsquo;, respectively; Calc can simplify these to
  0 and 1 (respectively) if <code>n</code> has been declared to be
  an integer.</p>

  <p>Trigonometric functions are simplified in several ways.
  Whenever a products of two trigonometric functions can be
  replaced by a single function, the replacement is made; for
  example, &lsquo;<samp><tt>tan</tt>(x)
  <tt>cos</tt>(x)</samp>&rsquo; is simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>sin</tt>(x)</samp>&rsquo;. Reciprocals of
  trigonometric functions are replaced by their reciprocal
  function; for example,
  &lsquo;<samp>1/<tt>sec</tt>(x)</samp>&rsquo; is simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>cos</tt>(x)</samp>&rsquo;. The corresponding
  simplifications for the hyperbolic functions are also
  handled.</p>

  <p>Trigonometric functions of their inverse functions are
  simplified. The expression
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>sin</tt>(<tt>arcsin</tt>(x))</samp>&rsquo; is
  simplified to &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;, and similarly for
  <code>cos</code> and <code>tan</code>. Trigonometric functions of
  inverses of different trigonometric functions can also be
  simplified, as in
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>sin</tt>(<tt>arccos</tt>(x))</samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt>(1 - x^2)</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If the argument to <code>sin</code> is negative-looking, it is
  simplified to &lsquo;<samp>-<tt>sin</tt>(x)</samp>&rsquo;, and
  similarly for <code>cos</code> and <code>tan</code>. Finally,
  certain special values of the argument are recognized; see
  <a href=
  "Trigonometric-and-Hyperbolic-Functions.html#Trigonometric-and-Hyperbolic-Functions">
  Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions</a>.</p>

  <p>Hyperbolic functions of their inverses and of negative-looking
  arguments are also handled, as are exponentials of inverse
  hyperbolic functions.</p>

  <p>No simplifications for inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic
  functions are known, except for negative arguments of
  <code>arcsin</code>, <code>arctan</code>, <code>arcsinh</code>,
  and <code>arctanh</code>. Note that
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>arcsin</tt>(<tt>sin</tt>(x))</samp>&rsquo; can
  <em>not</em> safely change to &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;, since
  this only correct within an integer multiple of &lsquo;<samp>2
  pi</samp>&rsquo; radians or 360 degrees. However,
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>arcsinh</tt>(<tt>sinh</tt>(x))</samp>&rsquo; is
  simplified to &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; if
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is known to be real.</p>

  <p>Several simplifications that apply to logarithms and
  exponentials are that
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt>(<tt>ln</tt>(x))</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>e^<tt>ln</tt>(x)</samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp>10^<tt>log10</tt>(x)</samp>&rsquo; all reduce to
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;. Also,
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>ln</tt>(<tt>exp</tt>(x))</samp>&rsquo;, etc.,
  can reduce to &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; if
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is provably real. The form
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt>(x)^y</samp>&rsquo; is simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt>(x y)</samp>&rsquo;. If
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is a suitable multiple of
  &lsquo;<samp>pi i</samp>&rsquo; (as described above for the
  trigonometric functions), then
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt>(x)</samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp>e^x</samp>&rsquo; will be expanded. Finally,
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>ln</tt>(x)</samp>&rsquo; is simplified to a form
  involving <code>pi</code> and <code>i</code> where
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is provably negative, positive
  imaginary, or negative imaginary.</p>

  <p>The error functions <code>erf</code> and <code>erfc</code> are
  simplified when their arguments are negative-looking or are calls
  to the <code>conj</code> function.</p>

  <p>Equations and inequalities are simplified by canceling factors
  of products, quotients, or sums on both sides. Inequalities
  change sign if a negative multiplicative factor is canceled.
  Non-constant multiplicative factors as in &lsquo;<samp>a b = a
  c</samp>&rsquo; are canceled from equations only if they are
  provably nonzero (generally because they were declared so; see
  <a href="Declarations.html#Declarations">Declarations</a>).
  Factors are canceled from inequalities only if they are nonzero
  and their sign is known.</p>

  <p>Simplification also replaces an equation or inequality with 1
  or 0 (&ldquo;true&rdquo; or &ldquo;false&rdquo;) if it can
  through the use of declarations. If &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;
  is declared to be an integer greater than 5, then &lsquo;<samp>x
  &lt; 3</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>x = 3</samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp>x = 7.5</samp>&rsquo; are all simplified to 0, but
  &lsquo;<samp>x &gt; 3</samp>&rsquo; is simplified to 1. By a
  similar analysis, &lsquo;<samp>abs(x) &gt;= 0</samp>&rsquo; is
  simplified to 1, as is &lsquo;<samp>x^2 &gt;= 0</samp>&rsquo; if
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; is known to be real.</p>
