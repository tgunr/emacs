  <h4 class="subsection">2.7.57 Rewrites Tutorial Exercise 6</h4>

  <p>Here is a rule set that will do the job:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
[ a*(b + c) := a*b + a*c,
  opt(a) O(x^n) + opt(b) O(x^m) := O(x^n) :: n &lt;= m
     :: constant(a) :: constant(b),
  opt(a) O(x^n) + opt(b) x^m := O(x^n) :: n &lt;= m
     :: constant(a) :: constant(b),
  a O(x^n) := O(x^n) :: constant(a),
  x^opt(m) O(x^n) := O(x^(n+m)),
  O(x^n) O(x^m) := O(x^(n+m)) ]
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>If we really want the <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>*</kbd> keys to
  operate naturally on power series, we should put these rules in
  <code>EvalRules</code>. For testing purposes, it is better to put
  them in a different variable, say, <code>O</code>, first.</p>

  <p>The first rule just expands products of sums so that the rest
  of the rules can assume they have an expanded-out polynomial to
  work with. Note that this rule does not mention
  &lsquo;<samp>O</samp>&rsquo; at all, so it will apply to any
  product-of-sum it encounters&mdash;this rule may surprise you if
  you put it into <code>EvalRules</code>!</p>

  <p>In the second rule, the sum of two O&rsquo;s is changed to the
  smaller O. The optional constant coefficients are there mostly so
  that &lsquo;<samp>O(x^2) - O(x^3)</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>O(x^3) - O(x^2)</samp>&rsquo; are handled as well as
  &lsquo;<samp>O(x^2) + O(x^3)</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The third rule absorbs higher powers of
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; into O&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>The fourth rule says that a constant times a negligible
  quantity is still negligible. (This rule will also match
  &lsquo;<samp>O(x^3) / 4</samp>&rsquo;, with &lsquo;<samp>a =
  1/4</samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  <p>The fifth rule rewrites, for example, &lsquo;<samp>x^2
  O(x^3)</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>O(x^5)</samp>&rsquo;. (It is
  easy to see that if one of these forms is negligible, the other
  is, too.) Notice the &lsquo;<samp>x^opt(m)</samp>&rsquo; to pick
  up terms like &lsquo;<samp>x&nbsp;O(x^3)</samp>&rsquo;
  <!-- /@w -->. Optional powers will match
  &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; as &lsquo;<samp>x^1</samp>&rsquo;
  but not 1 as &lsquo;<samp>x^0</samp>&rsquo;. This turns out to be
  exactly what we want here.</p>

  <p>The sixth rule is the corresponding rule for products of two
  O&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>Another way to solve this problem would be to create a new
  &ldquo;data type&rdquo; that represents truncated power series.
  We might represent these as function calls
  &lsquo;<samp>series(<var>coefs</var>, <var>x</var>)</samp>&rsquo;
  where <var>coefs</var> is a vector of coefficients for
  &lsquo;<samp>x^0</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>x^1</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>x^2</samp>&rsquo;, and so on. Rules would exist for
  sums and products of such <code>series</code> objects, and as an
  optional convenience could also know how to combine a
  <code>series</code> object with a normal polynomial. (With this,
  and with a rule that rewrites &lsquo;<samp>O(x^n)</samp>&rsquo;
  to the equivalent <code>series</code> form, you could still enter
  power series in exactly the same notation as before.) Operations
  on such objects would probably be more efficient, although the
  objects would be a bit harder to read.</p>

  <p>Some other symbolic math programs provide a power series data
  type similar to this. Mathematica, for example, has an object
  that looks like &lsquo;<samp>PowerSeries[<var>x</var>,
  <var>x0</var>, <var>coefs</var>, <var>nmin</var>,
  <var>nmax</var>, <var>den</var>]</samp>&rsquo;, where
  <var>x0</var> is the point about which the power series is taken
  (we&rsquo;ve been assuming this was always zero), and
  <var>nmin</var>, <var>nmax</var>, and <var>den</var> allow
  pseudo-power-series with fractional or negative powers. Also, the
  <code>PowerSeries</code> objects have a special display format
  that makes them look like &lsquo;<samp>2 x^2 +
  O(x^4)</samp>&rsquo; when they are printed out. (See <a href=
  "Compositions.html#Compositions">Compositions</a>, for a way to
  do this in Calc, although for something as involved as this it
  would probably be better to write the formatting routine in
  Lisp.)</p>
