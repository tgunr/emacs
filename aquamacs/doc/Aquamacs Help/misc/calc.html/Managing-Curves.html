  <h3 class="section">13.3 Managing Curves</h3>

  <p>The <kbd>g f</kbd> command is really shorthand for the
  following commands: <kbd>C-u g d g a g p</kbd>. Likewise,
  <kbd>g&nbsp;F</kbd><!-- /@w --> is shorthand for <kbd>C-u g d g A
  g p</kbd>. You can gain more control over your graph by using
  these commands directly.</p><a name="index-g-a" id=
  "index-g-a"></a> <a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002dadd" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dadd"></a>

  <p>The <kbd>g a</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-add</code>) command adds
  the &ldquo;curve&rdquo; represented by the two values on the top
  of the stack to the current graph. You can have any number of
  curves in the same graph. When you give the <kbd>g p</kbd>
  command, all the curves will be drawn superimposed on the same
  axes.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>g a</kbd> command (and many others that affect the
  current graph) will cause a special buffer, <samp>*Gnuplot
  Commands*</samp>, to be displayed in another window. This buffer
  is a template of the commands that will be sent to GNUPLOT when
  it is time to draw the graph. The first <kbd>g a</kbd> command
  adds a <code>plot</code> command to this buffer. Succeeding
  <kbd>g a</kbd> commands add extra curves onto that
  <code>plot</code> command. Other graph-related commands put other
  GNUPLOT commands into this buffer. In normal usage you never need
  to work with this buffer directly, but you can if you wish. The
  only constraint is that there must be only one <code>plot</code>
  command, and it must be the last command in the buffer. If you
  want to save and later restore a complete graph configuration,
  you can use regular Emacs commands to save and restore the
  contents of the <samp>*Gnuplot Commands*</samp>
  buffer.</p><a name="index-PlotData1" id="index-PlotData1"></a>
  <a name="index-PlotData2" id="index-PlotData2"></a>

  <p>If the values on the stack are not variable names, <kbd>g
  a</kbd> will invent variable names for them (of the form
  &lsquo;<samp>PlotData<var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;) and store the
  values in those variables. The &ldquo;x&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;y&rdquo; variables are what go into the <code>plot</code>
  command in the template. If you add a curve that uses a certain
  variable and then later change that variable, you can replot the
  graph without having to delete and re-add the curve. That&rsquo;s
  because the variable name, not the vector, interval or formula
  itself, is what was added by <kbd>g a</kbd>.</p>

  <p>A numeric prefix argument on <kbd>g a</kbd> or <kbd>g f</kbd>
  changes the way stack entries are interpreted as curves. With a
  positive prefix argument &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;, the top
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; stack entries are &ldquo;y&rdquo;
  values for &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; different curves which
  share a common &ldquo;x&rdquo; value in the
  &lsquo;<samp>n+1</samp>&rsquo;st stack entry. (Thus <kbd>g
  a</kbd> with no prefix argument is equivalent to <kbd>C-u 1 g
  a</kbd>.)</p>

  <p>A prefix of zero or plain <kbd>C-u</kbd> means to take two
  stack entries, &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo; as usual, but
  to interpret &ldquo;y&rdquo; as a vector of &ldquo;y&rdquo;
  values for several curves that share a common
  &ldquo;x&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>A negative prefix argument tells Calc to read
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; vectors from the stack; each vector
  &lsquo;<samp>[x, y]</samp>&rsquo; describes an independent curve.
  This is the only form of <kbd>g a</kbd> that creates several
  curves at once that don&rsquo;t have common &ldquo;x&rdquo;
  values. (Of course, the range of &ldquo;x&rdquo; values covered
  by all the curves ought to be roughly the same if they are to
  look nice on the same graph.)</p>

  <p>For example, to plot &lsquo;<samp>sin(n x)</samp>&rsquo; for
  integers &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; from 1 to 5, you could use
  <kbd>v x</kbd> to create a vector of integers
  (&lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;), then <kbd>V M '</kbd> or <kbd>V M
  $</kbd> to map &lsquo;<samp>sin(n x)</samp>&rsquo; across this
  vector. The resulting vector of formulas is suitable for use as
  the &ldquo;y&rdquo; argument to a <kbd>C-u g a</kbd> or <kbd>C-u
  g f</kbd> command.</p><a name="index-g-A" id="index-g-A"></a>
  <a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002dadd_002d3d" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dadd_002d3d"></a>

  <p>The <kbd>g A</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-add-3d</code>) command
  adds a 3D curve to the graph. It is not valid to intermix 2D and
  3D curves in a single graph. This command takes three arguments,
  &ldquo;x&rdquo;, &ldquo;y&rdquo;, and &ldquo;z&rdquo;, from the
  stack. With a positive prefix &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;, it
  takes &lsquo;<samp>n+2</samp>&rsquo; arguments (common
  &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo;, plus
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; separate &ldquo;z&rdquo;s). With a
  zero prefix, it takes three stack entries but the &ldquo;z&rdquo;
  entry is a vector of curve values. With a negative prefix
  &lsquo;<samp>-n</samp>&rsquo;, it takes
  &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; vectors of the form &lsquo;<samp>[x,
  y, z]</samp>&rsquo;. The <kbd>g A</kbd> command works by adding a
  <code>splot</code> (surface-plot) command to the <samp>*Gnuplot
  Commands*</samp> buffer.</p>

  <p>(Although <kbd>g a</kbd> adds a 2D <code>plot</code> command
  to the <samp>*Gnuplot Commands*</samp> buffer, Calc changes this
  to <code>splot</code> before sending it to GNUPLOT if it notices
  that the data points are evaluating to <code>xyz</code> calls. It
  will not work to mix 2D and 3D <kbd>g a</kbd> curves in a single
  graph, although Calc does not currently check for
  this.)</p><a name="index-g-d" id="index-g-d"></a> <a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002ddelete" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002ddelete"></a>

  <p>The <kbd>g d</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-delete</code>) command
  deletes the most recently added curve from the graph. It has no
  effect if there are no curves in the graph. With a numeric prefix
  argument of any kind, it deletes all of the curves from the
  graph.</p><a name="index-g-H" id="index-g-H"></a> <a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dhide" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dhide"></a>

  <p>The <kbd>g H</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-hide</code>) command
  &ldquo;hides&rdquo; or &ldquo;unhides&rdquo; the most recently
  added curve. A hidden curve will not appear in the actual plot,
  but information about it such as its name and line and point
  styles will be retained.</p><a name="index-g-j" id=
  "index-g-j"></a> <a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002djuggle" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002djuggle"></a>

  <p>The <kbd>g j</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-juggle</code>) command
  moves the curve at the end of the list (the &ldquo;most recently
  added curve&rdquo;) to the front of the list. The
  next-most-recent curve is thus exposed for <kbd>g&nbsp;d</kbd>
  <!-- /@w --> or similar commands to use. With <kbd>g j</kbd> you
  can work with any curve in the graph even though curve-related
  commands only affect the last curve in the list.</p><a name=
  "index-g-p" id="index-g-p"></a> <a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dplot" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dplot"></a>

  <p>The <kbd>g p</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-plot</code>) command uses
  GNUPLOT to draw the graph described in the <samp>*Gnuplot
  Commands*</samp> buffer. Any GNUPLOT parameters which are not
  defined by commands in this buffer are reset to their default
  values. The variables named in the <code>plot</code> command are
  written to a temporary data file and the variable names are then
  replaced by the file name in the template. The resulting plotting
  commands are fed to the GNUPLOT program. See the documentation
  for the GNUPLOT program for more specific information. All
  temporary files are removed when Emacs or GNUPLOT exits.</p>

  <p>If you give a formula for &ldquo;y&rdquo;, Calc will remember
  all the values that it calculates for the formula so that later
  plots can reuse these values. Calc throws out these saved values
  when you change any circumstances that may affect the data, such
  as switching from Degrees to Radians mode, or changing the value
  of a parameter in the formula. You can force Calc to recompute
  the data from scratch by giving a negative numeric prefix
  argument to <kbd>g p</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Calc uses a fairly rough step size when graphing formulas over
  intervals. This is to ensure quick response. You can
  &ldquo;refine&rdquo; a plot by giving a positive numeric prefix
  argument to <kbd>g p</kbd>. Calc goes through the data points it
  has computed and saved from previous plots of the function, and
  computes and inserts a new data point midway between each of the
  existing points. You can refine a plot any number of times, but
  beware that the amount of calculation involved doubles each
  time.</p>

  <p>Calc does not remember computed values for 3D graphs. This
  means the numerix prefix argument, if any, to <kbd>g p</kbd> is
  effectively ignored if the current graph is
  three-dimensional.</p><a name="index-g-P" id="index-g-P"></a>
  <a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002dprint" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dprint"></a>

  <p>The <kbd>g P</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-print</code>) command is
  like <kbd>g p</kbd>, except that it sends the output to a printer
  instead of to the screen. More precisely, <kbd>g p</kbd> looks
  for &lsquo;<samp>set terminal</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>set
  output</samp>&rsquo; commands in the <samp>*Gnuplot
  Commands*</samp> buffer; lacking these it uses the default
  settings. However, <kbd>g P</kbd> ignores &lsquo;<samp>set
  terminal</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>set output</samp>&rsquo;
  commands and uses a different set of default values. All of these
  values are controlled by the <kbd>g D</kbd> and <kbd>g O</kbd>
  commands discussed below. Provided everything is set up properly,
  <kbd>g p</kbd> will plot to the screen unless you have specified
  otherwise and <kbd>g P</kbd> will always plot to the printer.</p>
