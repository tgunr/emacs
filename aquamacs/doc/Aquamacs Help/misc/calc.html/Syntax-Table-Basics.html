  <h4 class="subsubsection">6.8.11.1 Syntax Table Basics</h4>

  <p><em>Parsing</em> is the process of converting a raw string of
  characters, such as you would type in during algebraic entry,
  into a Calc formula. Calc&rsquo;s parser works in two stages.
  First, the input is broken down into <em>tokens</em>, such as
  words, numbers, and punctuation symbols like
  &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>:=</samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp>+/-</samp>&rsquo;. Space between tokens is ignored
  (except when it serves to separate adjacent words). Next, the
  parser matches this string of tokens against various built-in
  syntactic patterns, such as &ldquo;an expression followed by
  &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; followed by another
  expression&rdquo; or &ldquo;a name followed by
  &lsquo;<samp>(</samp>&rsquo;, zero or more expressions separated
  by commas, and &lsquo;<samp>)</samp>&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A <em>syntax table</em> is a list of user-defined <em>syntax
  rules</em>, which allow you to specify new patterns to define
  your own favorite input notations. Calc&rsquo;s parser always
  checks the syntax table for the current language mode, then the
  table for the Normal language mode, before it uses its built-in
  rules to parse an algebraic formula you have entered. Each syntax
  rule should go on its own line; it consists of a
  <em>pattern</em>, a &lsquo;<samp>:=</samp>&rsquo; symbol, and a
  Calc formula with an optional <em>condition</em>. (Syntax rules
  resemble algebraic rewrite rules, but the notation for patterns
  is completely different.)</p>

  <p>A syntax pattern is a list of tokens, separated by spaces.
  Except for a few special symbols, tokens in syntax patterns are
  matched literally, from left to right. For example, the rule,</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
foo ( ) := 2+3
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>would cause Calc to parse the formula
  &lsquo;<samp>4+foo()*5</samp>&rsquo; as if it were
  &lsquo;<samp>4+(2+3)*5</samp>&rsquo;. Notice that the parentheses
  were written as two separate tokens in the rule. As a result, the
  rule works for both &lsquo;<samp>foo()</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>foo&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;)</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.
  If we had written the rule as &lsquo;<samp>foo () :=
  2+3</samp>&rsquo;, then Calc would treat
  &lsquo;<samp>()</samp>&rsquo; as a single, indivisible token, so
  that &lsquo;<samp>foo(&nbsp;)</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> would not
  be recognized by the rule. (It would be parsed as a regular
  zero-argument function call instead.) In fact, this rule would
  also make trouble for the rest of Calc&rsquo;s parser: An
  unrelated formula like &lsquo;<samp>bar()</samp>&rsquo; would now
  be tokenized into &lsquo;<samp>bar ()</samp>&rsquo; instead of
  &lsquo;<samp>bar ( )</samp>&rsquo;, so that the standard parser
  for function calls would no longer recognize it!</p>

  <p>While it is possible to make a token with a mixture of letters
  and punctuation symbols, this is not recommended. It is better to
  break it into several tokens, as we did with
  &lsquo;<samp>foo()</samp>&rsquo; above.</p>

  <p>The symbol &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo; in a syntax pattern
  matches any Calc expression. On the righthand side, the things
  that matched the &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo;s can be referred to
  as &lsquo;<samp>#1</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>#2</samp>&rsquo;,
  and so on (where &lsquo;<samp>#1</samp>&rsquo; matches the
  leftmost &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo; in the pattern). For
  example, these rules match a user-defined function, prefix
  operator, infix operator, and postfix operator, respectively:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
foo ( # ) := myfunc(#1)
foo # := myprefix(#1)
# foo # := myinfix(#1,#2)
# foo := mypostfix(#1)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Thus &lsquo;<samp>foo(3)</samp>&rsquo; will parse as
  &lsquo;<samp>myfunc(3)</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>2+3
  foo</samp>&rsquo; will parse as
  &lsquo;<samp>mypostfix(2+3)</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>It is important to write the first two rules in the order
  shown, because Calc tries rules in order from first to last. If
  the pattern &lsquo;<samp>foo #</samp>&rsquo; came first, it would
  match anything that could match the &lsquo;<samp>foo ( #
  )</samp>&rsquo; rule, since an expression in parentheses is
  itself a valid expression. Thus the
  &lsquo;<samp>foo&nbsp;(&nbsp;#&nbsp;)</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
   rule would never get to match anything. Likewise, the last two
  rules must be written in the order shown or else &lsquo;<samp>3
  foo 4</samp>&rsquo; will be parsed as &lsquo;<samp>mypostfix(3) *
  4</samp>&rsquo;. (Of course, the best way to avoid these
  ambiguities is not to use the same symbol in more than one way at
  the same time! In case you&rsquo;re not convinced, try the
  following exercise: How will the above rules parse the input
  &lsquo;<samp>foo(3,4)</samp>&rsquo;, if at all? Work it out for
  yourself, then try it in Calc and see.)</p>

  <p>Calc is quite flexible about what sorts of patterns are
  allowed. The only rule is that every pattern must begin with a
  literal token (like &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo; in the first
  two patterns above), or with a &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo;
  followed by a literal token (as in the last two patterns). After
  that, any mixture is allowed, although putting two
  &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo;s in a row will not be very useful
  since two expressions with nothing between them will be parsed as
  one expression that uses implicit multiplication.</p>

  <p>As a more practical example, Maple uses the notation
  &lsquo;<samp>sum(a(i), i=1..10)</samp>&rsquo; for sums, which
  Calc&rsquo;s Maple mode doesn&rsquo;t recognize at present. To
  handle this syntax, we simply add the rule,</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
sum ( # , # = # .. # ) := sum(#1,#2,#3,#4)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>to the Maple mode syntax table. As another example, C mode
  can&rsquo;t read assignment operators like
  &lsquo;<samp>++</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>*=</samp>&rsquo;.
  We can define these operators quite easily:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
# *= # := muleq(#1,#2)
# ++ := postinc(#1)
++ # := preinc(#1)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>To complete the job, we would use corresponding composition
  functions and <kbd>Z C</kbd> to cause these functions to display
  in their respective Maple and C notations. (Note that the C
  example ignores issues of operator precedence, which are
  discussed in the next section.)</p>

  <p>You can enclose any token in quotes to prevent its usual
  interpretation in syntax patterns:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
# ":=" # := becomes(#1,#2)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Quotes also allow you to include spaces in a token, although
  once again it is generally better to use two tokens than one
  token with an embedded space. To include an actual quotation mark
  in a quoted token, precede it with a backslash. (This also works
  to include backslashes in tokens.)</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
# "bad token" # "/\"\\" # := silly(#1,#2,#3)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This will parse &lsquo;<samp>3 bad token 4 /"\ 5</samp>&rsquo;
  to &lsquo;<samp>silly(3,4,5)</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The token <kbd>#</kbd> has a predefined meaning in
  Calc&rsquo;s formula parser; it is not valid to use
  &lsquo;<samp>"#"</samp>&rsquo; in a syntax rule. However, longer
  tokens that include the &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo; character
  are allowed. Also, while &lsquo;<samp>"$"</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>"\""</samp>&rsquo; are allowed as tokens, their
  presence in the syntax table will prevent those characters from
  working in their usual ways (referring to stack entries and
  quoting strings, respectively).</p>

  <p>Finally, the notation &lsquo;<samp>%%</samp>&rsquo; anywhere
  in a syntax table causes the rest of the line to be ignored as a
  comment.</p>
