      <p>Works similarly, but copies the current difference region
      from buffer B to buffer A (in <em>comparison sessions</em>)
      or the merge buffer (in <em>merge sessions</em>).</p>

      <p>Ediff saves the old contents of the difference region

      <a name="index-j" id="index-j"></a>

      <p>Makes the very first difference region current.</p>

      <p><kbd>-j</kbd> makes the last region current. Typing a
      number, N, and then <kbd>j</kbd> makes the difference region
      N current. Typing -N (a negative number) then <kbd>j</kbd>

      <p>Makes current the difference region closest to the
      position of the point in buffer A.</p>

      <p>However, with a prefix argument, Ediff would position all
      variants around the area indicated by the current point in
      buffer A: if the point is inside a difference region, then
      the variants will be positioned at this difference region. If
      the point is not in any difference region, then it is in an
      area where all variants agree with each other. In this case,
      the variants will be positioned so that each would display
      this area (of agreement).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>gb</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-gb" id="index-gb"></a>

      <p>Makes current the difference region closest to the
      position of the point in buffer B.</p>

      <p>With a prefix argument, behaves like <kbd>ga</kbd>, but
      with respect to buffer B.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>gc</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-gc" id="index-gc"></a>

      <p><em>In merge sessions:</em> makes current the difference
      region closest to the point in the merge buffer.</p>

      <p><em>In 3-file comparison sessions:</em> makes current the
      region closest to the point in buffer C.</p>

      <p>With a prefix argument, behaves like <kbd>ga</kbd>, but
      with respect to buffer C.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>!</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-_0021" id="index-_0021"></a>

      <p>Recomputes the difference regions, bringing them up to
      date. This is often needed because it is common to do all
      sorts of editing during Ediff sessions, so after a while, the
      highlighted difference regions may no longer reflect the
      actual differences among the buffers.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>*</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-_002a" id="index-_002a"></a>

      <p>Forces refinement of the current difference region, which
      highlights the exact words of disagreement among the buffers.
      With a negative prefix argument, unhighlights the current
      region.</p>

      <p>Forceful refinement may be needed if Ediff encounters a
      difference region that is larger than
      <code>ediff-auto-refine-limit</code>. In this situation,
      Ediff doesn&rsquo;t do automatic refinement in order to
      improve response time. (Ediff doesn&rsquo;t auto-refine on
      dumb terminals as well, but <kbd>*</kbd> still works there.
      However, the only useful piece of information it can tell you
      is whether or not the difference regions disagree only in the
      amount of white space.)</p>

      <p>This command is also useful when the highlighted fine
      differences are no longer current, due to user editing.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>m</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-m" id="index-m"></a>

      <p>Displays the current Ediff session in a frame as wide as
      the physical display. This is useful when comparing files
      side-by-side. Typing <kbd>m</kbd> again restores the original
      size of the frame.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>|</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-_007c" id="index-_007c"></a>

      <p>Toggles the horizontal/vertical split of the Ediff
      display. Horizontal split is convenient when it is possible
      to compare files side-by-side. If the frame in which files
      are displayed is too narrow and lines are cut off, typing
      <kbd>m</kbd> may help some.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>@</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-_0040" id="index-_0040"></a>

      <p>Toggles auto-refinement of difference regions (i.e.,
      automatic highlighting of the exact words that differ among
      the variants). Auto-refinement is turned off on devices where
      Emacs doesn&rsquo;t support highlighting.</p>

      <p>On slow machines, it may be advantageous to turn
      auto-refinement off. The user can always forcefully refine
      specific difference regions by typing <kbd>*</kbd>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>h</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-h" id="index-h"></a>

      <p>Cycles between full highlighting, the mode where fine
      differences are not highlighted (but computed), and the mode
      where highlighting is done with <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
      strings. The latter is not really recommended, unless on a
      dumb TTY.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>r</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-r" id="index-r"></a>

      <p>Restores the old contents of the region in the merge
      buffer. (If you copied a difference region from buffer A or B
      into the merge buffer using the commands <kbd>a</kbd> or
      <kbd>b</kbd>, Ediff saves the old contents of the region in
      case you change your mind.)</p>

      <p>This command is enabled in merge sessions only.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>ra</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-ra" id="index-ra"></a>

      <p>Restores the old contents of the current difference region
      in buffer A, which was previously saved when the user invoked
      one of these commands: <kbd>b</kbd>, <kbd>ba</kbd>,
      <kbd>ca</kbd>, which see. This command is enabled in
      comparison sessions only.</p>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-rb" id="index-rb"></a>

      in buffer B, which was previously saved when the user invoked
      one of these commands: <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>ab</kbd>,
      <kbd>cb</kbd>, which see. This command is enabled in
      comparison sessions only.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>rc</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-rc" id="index-rc"></a>

      <p>Restores the old contents of the current difference region
      in buffer C, which was previously saved when the user invoked
      one of these commands: <kbd>ac</kbd>, <kbd>bc</kbd>, which
      see. This command is enabled in 3-file comparison sessions
      only.</p>

    <dt><kbd>##</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-_0023_0023" id="index-_0023_0023"></a>

      <p>Tell Ediff to skip over regions that disagree among
      themselves only in the amount of white space and line
      breaks.</p>

      <p>Even though such regions will be skipped over, you can
      still jump to any one of them by typing the region number and
      then <kbd>j</kbd>. Typing <kbd>##</kbd> again puts Ediff back
      in the original state.</p>

      <p>Toggle case sensitivity in the diff program. All diffs are
      recomputed. Case sensitivity is controlled by the variables
      <code>ediff-ignore-case-option</code>,
      <code>ediff-ignore-case-option3</code>, and
      <code>ediff-ignore-case</code>, which are explained

      <p>Ediff works hard to ameliorate the effects of boredom in
      the workplace...</p>

      <p>Quite often differences are due to identical replacements
      (e.g., the word &ldquo;foo&rdquo; is replaced with the word
      &ldquo;bar&rdquo; everywhere). If the number of regions with
      such boring differences exceeds your tolerance threshold, you
      may be tempted to tell Ediff to skip these regions altogether
      (you will still be able to jump to them via the command
      <kbd>j</kbd>). The above commands, <kbd>#h</kbd> and
      <kbd>#f</kbd>, may well save your day!</p>

      <p><kbd>#h</kbd> prompts you to specify regular expressions
      for each variant. Difference regions where each
      variant&rsquo;s region matches the corresponding regular
      expression will be skipped from then on. (You can also tell
      Ediff to skip regions where at least one variant matches its
      regular expression.)</p>

      <p><kbd>#f</kbd> does dual job: it focuses on regions that
      match the corresponding regular expressions. All other
      regions will be skipped over. See <a href=
      "Selective-Browsing.html#Selective-Browsing">Selective
      Browsing</a>, for more.</p>

    <dt><kbd>A</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-A" id="index-A"></a>

      <p>Toggles the read-only property in buffer A. If file A is

      <p>Displays a list of currently active Ediff
      sessions&mdash;the Ediff Registry. You can then restart any
      of these sessions by either clicking on a session record or
      by putting the cursor over it and then typing the return
      key.</p>

      <p>(Some poor souls leave so many active Ediff sessions
      around that they lose track of them completely... The
      <kbd>R</kbd> command is designed to save these people from
      the recently discovered Ediff Proficiency Syndrome.)</p>

      <p>Typing <kbd>R</kbd> brings up Ediff Registry only if it is
      typed into an Ediff Control Panel. If you don&rsquo;t have a
      control panel handy, type this in the minibuffer: <kbd>M-x
      eregistry</kbd>. See <a href=

      <p>The easiest way to resume a suspended Ediff session is

      <p>Terminates this Ediff session. With a prefix argument

      <p>While merging with an ancestor file, Ediff is determined
      to reduce user&rsquo;s wear and tear by saving him and her
      much of unproductive, repetitive typing. If it notices that,
      say, file A&rsquo;s difference region is identical to the
      same difference region in the ancestor file, then the merge
      buffer will automatically get the difference region taken
      from buffer B. The rationale is that this difference region
      in buffer A is as old as that in the ancestor buffer, so the
      contents of that region in buffer B represents real
      change.</p>

      <p>You may want to ignore such &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; merges
      and concentrate on difference regions where both files
      &ldquo;clash&rdquo; with the ancestor, since this means that
      two different people have been changing this region
      independently and they had different ideas on how to do
      this.</p>

      <p>The above command does this for you by skipping the
      regions where only one of the variants clashes with the
      ancestor but the other variant agrees with it. Typing
      <kbd>$$</kbd> again undoes this setting.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>$*</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-_0024_002a" id="index-_0024_002a"></a>

      <p>When merging files with large number of differences, it is
      sometimes convenient to be able to skip the difference
      regions for which you already decided which variant is most
      appropriate. Typing <kbd>$*</kbd> will accomplish precisely
      this.</p>

      <p>To be more precise, this toggles the check for whether the
      current merge is identical to its default setting, as
      originally decided by Ediff. For instance, if Ediff is
      merging according to the &ldquo;combined&rdquo; policy, then
      the merge region is skipped over if it is different from the
      combination of the regions in buffers A and B. (Warning:
      swapping buffers A and B will confuse things in this
      respect.) If the merge region is marked as
      &ldquo;prefer-A&rdquo; then this region will be skipped if it
      differs from the current difference region in buffer A,
      etc.</p>

      <a name="index-_0026" id="index-_0026"></a>

      <p>In some situations, such as when one of the files agrees
      with the ancestor file on a difference region and the other
      doesn&rsquo;t, Ediff knows what to do: it copies the current
      difference region from the second buffer into the merge
      buffer.</p>

      <p>In other cases, the right course of action is not that
      clearcut, and Ediff would use a default action. The above
      command changes the default action. The default action can be
      &lsquo;<samp>default-A</samp>&rsquo; (choose the region from
      buffer A), &lsquo;<samp>default-B</samp>&rsquo; (choose the
      region from buffer B), or &lsquo;<samp>combined</samp>&rsquo;
      (combine the regions from the two buffers). See <a href=
      "Merging-and-diff3.html#Merging-and-diff3">Merging and
      diff3</a>, for further details.</p>

      <p>The command <kbd>&amp;</kbd> also affects the regions in
      the merge buffers that have
      &lsquo;<samp>default-A</samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp>default-B</samp>&rsquo;, or
      &lsquo;<samp>combined</samp>&rsquo; status, provided they
      weren&rsquo;t changed with respect to the original. For
      instance, if such a region has the status
      &lsquo;<samp>default-A</samp>&rsquo; then changing the
      default action to &lsquo;<samp>default-B</samp>&rsquo; will
      also replace this merge-buffer&rsquo;s region with the
      corresponding region from buffer B.</p>

      <p>Causes the merge window shrink to its minimum size,
      thereby exposing as much of the variant buffers as possible.
      Typing <kbd>s</kbd> again restores the original size of that
      window.</p>

      <p>With a positive prefix argument, this command enlarges the
      merge window. E.g., <kbd>4s</kbd> increases the size of the
      window by about 4 lines, if possible. With a negative numeric
      argument, the size of the merge window shrinks by that many
      lines, if possible. Thus, <kbd>-s</kbd> shrinks the window by
      about 1 line and <kbd>-3s</kbd> by about 3 lines.</p>

      <p>This command is intended only for temporary viewing;
      therefore, Ediff restores window C to its original size
      whenever it makes any other change in the window
      configuration. However, redisplaying (<kbd>C-l</kbd>) or
      jumping to another difference does not affect window
      C&rsquo;s size.</p>

      <p>The split between the merge window and the variant windows
      is controlled by the variable
      <code>ediff-merge-window-share</code>, which see.</p>

      <p>You may run into situations when a large chunk of text in
      one file has been edited and then moved to a different place
      in another file. In such a case, these two chunks of text are
      unlikely to belong to the same difference region, so the
      refinement feature of Ediff will not be able to tell you what
      exactly differs inside these chunks. Since eyeballing large
      pieces of text is contrary to human nature, Ediff has a
      special command to help reduce the risk of developing a
      cataract.</p>

      <p>In other situations, the currently highlighted region
      might be big and you might want to reconcile of them
      interactively.</p>

      <p>All of this can be done with the above command,
      <kbd>=</kbd>, which compares regions within Ediff buffers.
      Typing <kbd>=</kbd> creates a child Ediff session for
      comparing regions in buffers A, B, or C as follows.</p>

      <p>First, you will be asked whether you want to compare the
      fine differences between the currently highlighted buffers on
      a word-by-word basis. If you accept, a child Ediff session
      will start using the currently highlighted regions. Ediff
      will let you step over the differences word-wise.</p>

      <p>If you reject the offer, you will be asked to select
      regions of your choice.</p>

      <p><em>If you are comparing 2 files or buffers:</em> Ediff
      will ask you to select regions in buffers A and B.</p>

      <p><em>If you are comparing 3 files or buffers
      simultaneously:</em> Ediff will ask you to choose buffers and
      then select regions inside those buffers.</p>

      <p><em>If you are merging files or buffers (with or without
      ancestor):</em> Ediff will ask you to choose which buffer (A
      or B) to compare with the merge buffer and then select
      regions in those buffers.</p>
