  <p>Ediff provides a convenient way for simultaneous browsing
  through the differences between a pair (or a triple) of files or
  buffers (which are called &lsquo;<samp>variants</samp>&rsquo; for
  our purposes). The files being compared, file-A, file-B, and
  file-C (if applicable) are shown in separate windows (side by
  side, one above the another, or in separate frames), and the
  differences are highlighted as you step through them. You can
  also copy difference regions from one buffer to another (and
  recover old differences if you change your mind).</p>

  <p>Another powerful feature is the ability to merge a pair of
  files into a third buffer. Merging with an ancestor file is also
  supported. Furthermore, Ediff is equipped with directory-level
  capabilities that allow the user to conveniently launch browsing
  or merging sessions on groups of files in two (or three)
  different directories.</p>

  <p>In addition, Ediff can apply a patch to a file and then let
  you step through both files, the patched and the original one,
  simultaneously, difference-by-difference. You can even apply a
  patch right out of a mail buffer, i.e., patches received by mail
  don&rsquo;t even have to be saved. Since Ediff lets you copy
  differences between variants, you can, in effect, apply patches
  selectively (i.e., you can copy a difference region from
  <samp>file.orig</samp> to <samp>file</samp>, thereby undoing any
  particular patch that you don&rsquo;t like).</p>

  <p>Ediff even understands multi-file patches and can apply them
  interactively! (Ediff can recognize multi-file patches only if
  they are in the context format or GNU unified format. All other
  patches are treated as 1-file patches. Ediff is [hopefully] using
  the same algorithm as <code>patch</code> to determine which files
  need to be patched.)</p>

  <p>Ediff is aware of version control, which lets you compare
  files with their older versions. Ediff also works with remote and
  compressed files, automatically ftp&rsquo;ing them over and
  uncompressing them. See <a href=
  "Remote-and-Compressed-Files.html#Remote-and-Compressed-Files">Remote
  and Compressed Files</a>, for details.</p>

  <p>This package builds upon ideas borrowed from Emerge, and
  several of Ediff&rsquo;s functions are adaptations from Emerge.
  Although Ediff subsumes and greatly extends Emerge, much of the
  functionality in Ediff is influenced by Emerge. The architecture
  and the interface are, of course, drastically different.</p>
