  <h2 class="appendix">Appendix B Performance Issues</h2><a name=
  "index-performance" id="index-performance"></a>

  <p>C and its derivative languages are highly complex creatures.
  Often, ambiguous code situations arise that require CC Mode to
  scan large portions of the buffer to determine syntactic context.
  Such pathological code can cause CC Mode to perform fairly badly.
  This section gives some insight in how CC Mode operates, how that
  interacts with some coding styles, and what you can use to
  improve performance.</p>

  <p>The overall goal is that CC Mode shouldn&rsquo;t be overly
  slow (i.e., take more than a fraction of a second) in any
  interactive operation. I.e., it&rsquo;s tuned to limit the
  maximum response time in single operations, which is sometimes at
  the expense of batch-like operations like reindenting whole
  blocks. If you find that CC Mode gradually gets slower and slower
  in certain situations, perhaps as the file grows in size or as
  the macro or comment you&rsquo;re editing gets bigger, then
  chances are that something isn&rsquo;t working right. You should
  consider reporting it, unless it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s
  mentioned in this section.</p>

  <p>Because CC Mode has to scan the buffer backwards from the
  current insertion point, and because C&rsquo;s syntax is fairly
  difficult to parse in the backwards direction, CC Mode often
  tries to find the nearest position higher up in the buffer from
  which to begin a forward scan (it&rsquo;s typically an opening or
  closing parenthesis of some kind). The farther this position is
  from the current insertion point, the slower it gets.</p><a name=
  "index-beginning_002dof_002ddefun" id=
  "index-beginning_002dof_002ddefun"></a>

  <p>In earlier versions of CC Mode, we used to recommend putting
  the opening brace of a top-level construct<a name="DOCF49" href=
  "#FOOT49" id="DOCF49"><sup>49</sup></a> into the leftmost column.
  Earlier still, this used to be a rigid Emacs constraint, as
  embodied in the <code>beginning-of-defun</code> function. CC Mode
  now caches syntactic information much better, so that the delay
  caused by searching for such a brace when it&rsquo;s not in
  column 0 is minimal, except perhaps when you&rsquo;ve just moved
  a long way inside the file.</p><a name=
  "index-defun_002dprompt_002dregexp" id=
  "index-defun_002dprompt_002dregexp"></a> <a name=
  "index-c_002dJava_002ddefun_002dprompt_002dregexp" id=
  "index-c_002dJava_002ddefun_002dprompt_002dregexp"></a> <a name=
  "index-Java_002ddefun_002dprompt_002dregexp-_0028c_002d_0029" id=
  "index-Java_002ddefun_002dprompt_002dregexp-_0028c_002d_0029"></a>

  <p>A special note about <code>defun-prompt-regexp</code> in Java
  mode: The common style is to hang the opening braces of functions
  and classes on the right side of the line, and that doesn&rsquo;t
  work well with the Emacs approach. CC Mode comes with a constant
  <code>c-Java-defun-prompt-regexp</code> which tries to define a
  regular expression usable for this style, but there are problems
  with it. In some cases it can cause
  <code>beginning-of-defun</code> to hang<a name="DOCF50" href=
  "#FOOT50" id="DOCF50"><sup>50</sup></a>. For this reason, it is
  not used by default, but if you feel adventurous, you can set
  <code>defun-prompt-regexp</code> to it in your mode hook. In any
  event, setting and relying on <code>defun-prompt-regexp</code>
  will definitely slow things down because (X)Emacs will be doing
  regular expression searches a lot, so you&rsquo;ll probably be
  taking a hit either way!</p>

  <p>CC Mode maintains a cache of the opening parentheses of the
  blocks surrounding the point, and it adapts that cache as the
  point is moved around. That means that in bad cases it can take
  noticeable time to indent a line in a new surrounding, but after
  that it gets fast as long as the point isn&rsquo;t moved far off.
  The farther the point is moved, the less useful is the cache.
  Since editing typically is done in &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; rather
  than on single lines far apart from each other, the cache
  typically gives good performance even when the code doesn&rsquo;t
  fit the Emacs approach to finding the defun starts.</p><a name=
  "index-c_002denable_002dxemacs_002dperformance_002dkludge_002dp"
  id=
  "index-c_002denable_002dxemacs_002dperformance_002dkludge_002dp"></a>
  <a name=
  "index-enable_002dxemacs_002dperformance_002dkludge_002dp-_0028c_002d_0029"
  id=
  "index-enable_002dxemacs_002dperformance_002dkludge_002dp-_0028c_002d_0029">
  </a>

  <p>XEmacs users can set the variable
  <code>c-enable-xemacs-performance-kludge-p</code> to
  non-<code>nil</code>. This tells CC Mode to use XEmacs-specific
  built-in functions which, in some circumstances, can locate the
  top-most opening brace much more quickly than
  <code>beginning-of-defun</code>. Preliminary testing has shown
  that for styles where these braces are hung (e.g., most
  JDK-derived Java styles), this hack can improve performance of
  the core syntax parsing routines from 3 to 60 times. However, for
  styles which <em>do</em> conform to Emacs&rsquo;s recommended
  style of putting top-level braces in column zero, this hack can
  degrade performance by about as much. Thus this variable is set
  to <code>nil</code> by default, since the Emacs-friendly styles
  should be more common (and encouraged!). Note that this variable
  has no effect in Emacs since the necessary built-in functions
  don&rsquo;t exist (in Emacs 22.1 as of this writing in February
  2007).</p>

  <p>Text properties are used to speed up skipping over syntactic
  whitespace, i.e., comments and preprocessor directives. Indenting
  a line after a huge macro definition can be slow the first time,
  but after that the text properties are in place and it should be
  fast (even after you&rsquo;ve edited other parts of the file and
  then moved back).</p>

  <p>Font locking can be a CPU hog, especially the font locking
  done on decoration level 3 which tries to be very accurate. Note
  that that level is designed to be used with a font lock support
  mode that only fontifies the text that&rsquo;s actually shown,
  i.e., Lazy Lock or Just-in-time Lock mode, so make sure you use
  one of them. Fontification of a whole buffer with some thousand
  lines can often take over a minute. That is a known weakness; the
  idea is that it never should happen.</p>

  <p>The most effective way to speed up font locking is to reduce
  the decoration level to 2 by setting
  <code>font-lock-maximum-decoration</code> appropriately. That
  level is designed to be as pretty as possible without sacrificing
  performance. See <a href=
  "Font-Locking-Preliminaries.html#Font-Locking-Preliminaries">Font
  Locking Preliminaries</a>, for more info.</p>
