  <p>You must read this section to understand how the Spam package
  works. Do not skip, speed-read, or glance through this
  section.</p>

  <p>Make sure you read the section on the <code>spam.el</code>
  sequence of events. See See <a href=
  "Extending-the-Spam-package.html#Extending-the-Spam-package">Extending
  the Spam package</a>.</p><a name="index-spam_002dinitialize" id=
  "index-spam_002dinitialize"></a> <a name=
  "index-spam_002duse_002dstat" id=
  "index-spam_002duse_002dstat"></a>

  <p>To use the Spam package, you <strong>must</strong> first run
  the function <code>spam-initialize</code>:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(spam-initialize)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This autoloads <code>spam.el</code> and installs the various
  hooks necessary to let the Spam package do its job. In order to
  make use of the Spam package, you have to set up certain group
  parameters and variables, which we will describe below. All of
  the variables controlling the Spam package can be found in the
  &lsquo;<samp>spam</samp>&rsquo; customization group.</p>

  <p>There are two &ldquo;contact points&rdquo; between the Spam
  package and the rest of Gnus: checking new mail for spam, and
  leaving a group.</p>

  <p>Checking new mail for spam is done in one of two ways: while
  splitting incoming mail, or when you enter a group.</p>

  <p>The first way, checking for spam while splitting incoming
  mail, is suited to mail back ends such as <code>nnml</code> or
  <code>nnimap</code>, where new mail appears in a single spool
  file. The Spam package processes incoming mail, and sends mail
  considered to be spam to a designated &ldquo;spam&rdquo; group.
  See <a href=
  "Filtering-Incoming-Mail.html#Filtering-Incoming-Mail">Filtering
  Incoming Mail</a>.</p>

  <p>The second way is suited to back ends such as
  <code>nntp</code>, which have no incoming mail spool, or back
  ends where the server is in charge of splitting incoming mail. In
  this case, when you enter a Gnus group, the unseen or unread
  messages in that group are checked for spam. Detected spam
  messages are marked as spam. See <a href=
  "Detecting-Spam-in-Groups.html#Detecting-Spam-in-Groups">Detecting
  Spam in Groups</a>.</p><a name="index-spam-back-ends" id=
  "index-spam-back-ends"></a>

  <p>In either case, you have to tell the Spam package what method
  to use to detect spam messages. There are several methods, or
  <em>spam back ends</em> (not to be confused with Gnus back ends!)
  to choose from: spam &ldquo;blacklists&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;whitelists&rdquo;, dictionary-based filters, and so forth.
  See <a href="Spam-Back-Ends.html#Spam-Back-Ends">Spam Back
  Ends</a>.</p>

  <p>In the Gnus summary buffer, messages that have been identified
  as spam always appear with a &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo;
  symbol.</p>

  <p>The Spam package divides Gnus groups into three categories:
  ham groups, spam groups, and unclassified groups. You should mark
  each of the groups you subscribe to as either a ham group or a
  spam group, using the <code>spam-contents</code> group parameter
  (see <a href="Group-Parameters.html#Group-Parameters">Group
  Parameters</a>). Spam groups have a special property: when you
  enter a spam group, all unseen articles are marked as spam. Thus,
  mail split into a spam group is automatically marked as spam.</p>

  <p>Identifying spam messages is only half of the Spam
  package&rsquo;s job. The second half comes into play whenever you
  exit a group buffer. At this point, the Spam package does several
  things:</p>

  <p>First, it calls <em>spam and ham processors</em> to process
  the articles according to whether they are spam or ham. There is
  a pair of spam and ham processors associated with each spam back
  end, and what the processors do depends on the back end. At
  present, the main role of spam and ham processors is for
  dictionary-based spam filters: they add the contents of the
  messages in the group to the filter&rsquo;s dictionary, to
  improve its ability to detect future spam. The
  <code>spam-process</code> group parameter specifies what spam
  processors to use. See <a href=
  "Spam-and-Ham-Processors.html#Spam-and-Ham-Processors">Spam and
  Ham Processors</a>.</p>

  <p>If the spam filter failed to mark a spam message, you can mark
  it yourself, so that the message is processed as spam when you
  exit the group:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt><kbd>$</kbd></dt>

    <dt><kbd>M-d</kbd></dt>

    <dt><kbd>M s x</kbd></dt>

    <dt><kbd>S x</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-_0024-_0028Summary_0029" id=
      "index-_0024-_0028Summary_0029"></a> <a name=
      "index-M_002dd-_0028Summary_0029" id=
      "index-M_002dd-_0028Summary_0029"></a> <a name=
      "index-S-x-_0028Summary_0029" id=
      "index-S-x-_0028Summary_0029"></a> <a name=
      "index-M-s-x-_0028Summary_0029" id=
      "index-M-s-x-_0028Summary_0029"></a> <a name=
      "index-gnus_002dsummary_002dmark_002das_002dspam" id=
      "index-gnus_002dsummary_002dmark_002das_002dspam"></a>
      <a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dmark_002das_002dspam-1"
      id="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dmark_002das_002dspam-1"></a>

      <p>Mark current article as spam, showing it with the
      &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; mark
      (<code>gnus-summary-mark-as-spam</code>).</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Similarly, you can unmark an article if it has been
  erroneously marked as spam. See <a href=
  "Setting-Marks.html#Setting-Marks">Setting Marks</a>.</p>

  <p>Normally, a ham message found in a non-ham group is not
  processed as ham&mdash;the rationale is that it should be moved
  into a ham group for further processing (see below). However, you
  can force these articles to be processed as ham by setting
  <code>spam-process-ham-in-spam-groups</code> and
  <code>spam-process-ham-in-nonham-groups</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dham_002dprocess_002ddestinations" id=
  "index-gnus_002dham_002dprocess_002ddestinations"></a> <a name=
  "index-gnus_002dspam_002dprocess_002ddestinations" id=
  "index-gnus_002dspam_002dprocess_002ddestinations"></a>

  <p>The second thing that the Spam package does when you exit a
  group is to move ham articles out of spam groups, and spam
  articles out of ham groups. Ham in a spam group is moved to the
  group specified by the variable
  <code>gnus-ham-process-destinations</code>, or the group
  parameter <code>ham-process-destination</code>. Spam in a ham
  group is moved to the group specified by the variable
  <code>gnus-spam-process-destinations</code>, or the group
  parameter <code>spam-process-destination</code>. If these
  variables are not set, the articles are left in their current
  group. If an article cannot be moved (e.g., with a read-only
  backend such as <acronym>NNTP</acronym>), it is copied.</p>

  <p>If an article is moved to another group, it is processed again
  when you visit the new group. Normally, this is not a problem,
  but if you want each article to be processed only once, load the
  <code>gnus-registry.el</code> package and set the variable
  <code>spam-log-to-registry</code> to <code>t</code>. See <a href=
  "Spam-Package-Configuration-Examples.html#Spam-Package-Configuration-Examples">
  Spam Package Configuration Examples</a>.</p>

  <p>Normally, spam groups ignore
  <code>gnus-spam-process-destinations</code>. However, if you set
  <code>spam-move-spam-nonspam-groups-only</code> to
  <code>nil</code>, spam will also be moved out of spam groups,
  depending on the <code>spam-process-destination</code>
  parameter.</p>

  <p>The final thing the Spam package does is to mark spam articles
  as expired, which is usually the right thing to do.</p>

  <p>If all this seems confusing, don&rsquo;t worry. Soon it will
  be as natural as typing Lisp one-liners on a neural
  interface&hellip; err, sorry, that&rsquo;s 50 years in the future
  yet. Just trust us, it&rsquo;s not so bad.</p>
