  <h3 class="section">7.6 Adaptive Scoring</h3><a name=
  "index-adaptive-scoring" id="index-adaptive-scoring"></a>

  <p>If all this scoring is getting you down, Gnus has a way of
  making it all happen automatically&mdash;as if by magic. Or
  rather, as if by artificial stupidity, to be precise.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002duse_002dadaptive_002dscoring" id=
  "index-gnus_002duse_002dadaptive_002dscoring"></a>

  <p>When you read an article, or mark an article as read, or kill
  an article, you leave marks behind. On exit from the group, Gnus
  can sniff these marks and add score elements depending on what
  marks it finds. You turn on this ability by setting
  <code>gnus-use-adaptive-scoring</code> to <code>t</code> or
  <code>(line)</code>. If you want score adaptively on separate
  words appearing in the subjects, you should set this variable to
  <code>(word)</code>. If you want to use both adaptive methods,
  set this variable to <code>(word line)</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002ddefault_002dadaptive_002dscore_002dalist" id=
  "index-gnus_002ddefault_002dadaptive_002dscore_002dalist"></a>

  <p>To give you complete control over the scoring process, you can
  customize the <code>gnus-default-adaptive-score-alist</code>
  variable. For instance, it might look something like this:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(setq gnus-default-adaptive-score-alist
  '((gnus-unread-mark)
    (gnus-ticked-mark (from 4))
    (gnus-dormant-mark (from 5))
    (gnus-del-mark (from -4) (subject -1))
    (gnus-read-mark (from 4) (subject 2))
    (gnus-expirable-mark (from -1) (subject -1))
    (gnus-killed-mark (from -1) (subject -3))
    (gnus-kill-file-mark)
    (gnus-ancient-mark)
    (gnus-low-score-mark)
    (gnus-catchup-mark (from -1) (subject -1))))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>As you see, each element in this alist has a mark as a key
  (either a variable name or a &ldquo;real&rdquo; mark&mdash;a
  character). Following this key is a arbitrary number of
  header/score pairs. If there are no header/score pairs following
  the key, no adaptive scoring will be done on articles that have
  that key as the article mark. For instance, articles with
  <code>gnus-unread-mark</code> in the example above will not get
  adaptive score entries.</p>

  <p>Each article can have only one mark, so just a single of these
  rules will be applied to each article.</p>

  <p>To take <code>gnus-del-mark</code> as an example&mdash;this
  alist says that all articles that have that mark (i.e., are
  marked with &lsquo;<samp>e</samp>&rsquo;) will have a score entry
  added to lower based on the <code>From</code> header by -4, and
  lowered by <code>Subject</code> by -1. Change this to fit your
  prejudices.</p>

  <p>If you have marked 10 articles with the same subject with
  <code>gnus-del-mark</code>, the rule for that mark will be
  applied ten times. That means that that subject will get a score
  of ten times -1, which should be, unless I&rsquo;m much mistaken,
  -10.</p>

  <p>If you have auto-expirable (mail) groups (see <a href=
  "Expiring-Mail.html#Expiring-Mail">Expiring Mail</a>), all the
  read articles will be marked with the
  &lsquo;<samp>E</samp>&rsquo; mark. This&rsquo;ll probably make
  adaptive scoring slightly impossible, so auto-expiring and
  adaptive scoring doesn&rsquo;t really mix very well.</p>

  <p>The headers you can score on are <code>from</code>,
  <code>subject</code>, <code>message-id</code>,
  <code>references</code>, <code>xref</code>, <code>lines</code>,
  <code>chars</code> and <code>date</code>. In addition, you can
  score on <code>followup</code>, which will create an adaptive
  score entry that matches on the <code>References</code> header
  using the <code>Message-ID</code> of the current article, thereby
  matching the following thread.</p>

  <p>If you use this scheme, you should set the score file atom
  <code>mark</code> to something small&mdash;like -300, perhaps, to
  avoid having small random changes result in articles getting
  marked as read.</p>

  <p>After using adaptive scoring for a week or so, Gnus should
  start to become properly trained and enhance the authors you like
  best, and kill the authors you like least, without you having to
  say so explicitly.</p>

  <p>You can control what groups the adaptive scoring is to be
  performed on by using the score files (see <a href=
  "Score-File-Format.html#Score-File-Format">Score File
  Format</a>). This will also let you use different rules in
  different groups.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dfile_002dsuffix" id=
  "index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dfile_002dsuffix"></a>

  <p>The adaptive score entries will be put into a file where the
  name is the group name with
  <code>gnus-adaptive-file-suffix</code> appended. The default is
  <samp>ADAPT</samp>.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dpretty_002dprint" id=
  "index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dpretty_002dprint"></a>

  <p>Adaptive score files can get huge and are not meant to be
  edited by human hands. If <code>gnus-adaptive-pretty-print</code>
  is <code>nil</code> (the default) those files will not be written
  in a human readable way.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dscore_002dexact_002dadapt_002dlimit" id=
  "index-gnus_002dscore_002dexact_002dadapt_002dlimit"></a>

  <p>When doing adaptive scoring, substring or fuzzy matching would
  probably give you the best results in most cases. However, if the
  header one matches is short, the possibility for false positives
  is great, so if the length of the match is less than
  <code>gnus-score-exact-adapt-limit</code>, exact matching will be
  used. If this variable is <code>nil</code>, exact matching will
  always be used to avoid this problem.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002ddefault_002dadaptive_002dword_002dscore_002dalist"
  id=
  "index-gnus_002ddefault_002dadaptive_002dword_002dscore_002dalist"></a>

  <p>As mentioned above, you can adapt either on individual words
  or entire headers. If you adapt on words, the
  <code>gnus-default-adaptive-word-score-alist</code> variable says
  what score each instance of a word should add given a mark.</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(setq gnus-default-adaptive-word-score-alist
      `((,gnus-read-mark . 30)
        (,gnus-catchup-mark . -10)
        (,gnus-killed-mark . -20)
        (,gnus-del-mark . -15)))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This is the default value. If you have adaption on words
  enabled, every word that appears in subjects of articles marked
  with <code>gnus-read-mark</code> will result in a score rule that
  increase the score with 30 points.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002ddefault_002dignored_002dadaptive_002dwords" id=
  "index-gnus_002ddefault_002dignored_002dadaptive_002dwords"></a>
  <a name="index-gnus_002dignored_002dadaptive_002dwords" id=
  "index-gnus_002dignored_002dadaptive_002dwords"></a>

  <p>Words that appear in the
  <code>gnus-default-ignored-adaptive-words</code> list will be
  ignored. If you wish to add more words to be ignored, use the
  <code>gnus-ignored-adaptive-words</code> list
  instead.</p><a name="index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dword_002dlength_002dlimit"
  id="index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dword_002dlength_002dlimit"></a>

  <p>Some may feel that short words shouldn&rsquo;t count when
  doing adaptive scoring. If so, you may set
  <code>gnus-adaptive-word-length-limit</code> to an integer. Words
  shorter than this number will be ignored. This variable defaults
  to <code>nil</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dword_002dsyntax_002dtable" id=
  "index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dword_002dsyntax_002dtable"></a>

  <p>When the scoring is done,
  <code>gnus-adaptive-word-syntax-table</code> is the syntax table
  in effect. It is similar to the standard syntax table, but it
  considers numbers to be non-word-constituent
  characters.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dword_002dminimum" id=
  "index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dword_002dminimum"></a>

  <p>If <code>gnus-adaptive-word-minimum</code> is set to a number,
  the adaptive word scoring process will never bring down the score
  of an article to below this number. The default is
  <code>nil</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dword_002dno_002dgroup_002dwords" id=
  "index-gnus_002dadaptive_002dword_002dno_002dgroup_002dwords"></a>

  <p>If <code>gnus-adaptive-word-no-group-words</code> is set to
  <code>t</code>, gnus won&rsquo;t adaptively word score any of the
  words in the group name. Useful for groups like
  &lsquo;<samp>comp.editors.emacs</samp>&rsquo;, where most of the
  subject lines contain the word
  &lsquo;<samp>emacs</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>After using this scheme for a while, it might be nice to write
  a <code>gnus-psychoanalyze-user</code> command to go through the
  rules and see what words you like and what words you don&rsquo;t
  like. Or perhaps not.</p>

  <p>Note that the adaptive word scoring thing is highly
  experimental and is likely to change in the future. Initial
  impressions seem to indicate that it&rsquo;s totally useless as
  it stands. Some more work (involving more rigorous statistical
  methods) will have to be done to make this useful.</p>
