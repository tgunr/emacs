  <p>Spam and ham processors specify special actions to take when
  you exit a group buffer. Spam processors act on spam messages,
  and ham processors on ham messages. At present, the main role of
  these processors is to update the dictionaries of
  dictionary-based spam back ends such as Bogofilter (see <a href=
  "Bogofilter.html#Bogofilter">Bogofilter</a>) and the Spam
  Statistics package (see <a href=
  "Spam-Statistics-Filtering.html#Spam-Statistics-Filtering">Spam
  Statistics Filtering</a>).</p>

  <p>The spam and ham processors that apply to each group are
  determined by the group&rsquo;s<code>spam-process</code> group
  parameter. If this group parameter is not defined, they are
  determined by the variable
  <code>gnus-spam-process-newsgroups</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dspam_002dnewsgroup_002dcontents" id=
  "index-gnus_002dspam_002dnewsgroup_002dcontents"></a>

  <p>Gnus learns from the spam you get. You have to collect your
  spam in one or more spam groups, and set or customize the
  variable <code>spam-junk-mailgroups</code> as appropriate. You
  can also declare groups to contain spam by setting their group
  parameter <code>spam-contents</code> to
  <code>gnus-group-spam-classification-spam</code>, or by
  customizing the corresponding variable
  <code>gnus-spam-newsgroup-contents</code>. The
  <code>spam-contents</code> group parameter and the
  <code>gnus-spam-newsgroup-contents</code> variable can also be
  used to declare groups as <em>ham</em> groups if you set their
  classification to
  <code>gnus-group-spam-classification-ham</code>. If groups are
  not classified by means of <code>spam-junk-mailgroups</code>,
  <code>spam-contents</code>, or
  <code>gnus-spam-newsgroup-contents</code>, they are considered
  <em>unclassified</em>. All groups are unclassified by
  default.</p><a name="index-gnus_002dspam_002dmark" id=
  "index-gnus_002dspam_002dmark"></a> <a name="index-_0024" id=
  "index-_0024"></a>

  <p>In spam groups, all messages are considered to be spam by
  default: they get the &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; mark
  (<code>gnus-spam-mark</code>) when you enter the group. If you
  have seen a message, had it marked as spam, then unmarked it, it
  won&rsquo;t be marked as spam when you enter the group
  thereafter. You can disable that behavior, so all unread messages
  will get the &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; mark, if you set the
  <code>spam-mark-only-unseen-as-spam</code> parameter to
  <code>nil</code>. You should remove the
  &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; mark when you are in the group
  summary buffer for every message that is not spam after all. To
  remove the &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; mark, you can use
  <kbd>M-u</kbd> to &ldquo;unread&rdquo; the article, or
  <kbd>d</kbd> for declaring it read the non-spam way. When you
  leave a group, all spam-marked (&lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo;)
  articles are sent to a spam processor which will study them as
  spam samples.</p>

  <p>Messages may also be deleted in various other ways, and unless
  <code>ham-marks</code> group parameter gets overridden below,
  marks &lsquo;<samp>R</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo; for default read or explicit delete,
  marks &lsquo;<samp>X</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>K</samp>&rsquo; for automatic or explicit kills, as
  well as mark &lsquo;<samp>Y</samp>&rsquo; for low scores, are all
  considered to be associated with articles which are not spam.
  This assumption might be false, in particular if you use kill
  files or score files as means for detecting genuine spam, you
  should then adjust the <code>ham-marks</code> group
  parameter.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-ham_002dmarks" id=
    "index-ham_002dmarks"></a>Variable:
    <strong>ham-marks</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>You can customize this group or topic parameter to be the
      list of marks you want to consider ham. By default, the list
      contains the deleted, read, killed, kill-filed, and low-score
      marks (the idea is that these articles have been read, but
      are not spam). It can be useful to also include the tick mark
      in the ham marks. It is not recommended to make the unread
      mark a ham mark, because it normally indicates a lack of
      classification. But you can do it, and we&rsquo;ll be happy
      for you.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-spam_002dmarks" id=
    "index-spam_002dmarks"></a>Variable:
    <strong>spam-marks</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>You can customize this group or topic parameter to be the
      list of marks you want to consider spam. By default, the list
      contains only the spam mark. It is not recommended to change
      that, but you can if you really want to.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>When you leave <em>any</em> group, regardless of its
  <code>spam-contents</code> classification, all spam-marked
  articles are sent to a spam processor, which will study these as
  spam samples. If you explicit kill a lot, you might sometimes end
  up with articles marked &lsquo;<samp>K</samp>&rsquo; which you
  never saw, and which might accidentally contain spam. Best is to
  make sure that real spam is marked with
  &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo;, and nothing else.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dham_002dprocess_002ddestinations-1" id=
  "index-gnus_002dham_002dprocess_002ddestinations-1"></a>

  <p>When you leave a <em>spam</em> group, all spam-marked articles
  are marked as expired after processing with the spam processor.
  This is not done for <em>unclassified</em> or <em>ham</em>
  groups. Also, any <strong>ham</strong> articles in a spam group
  will be moved to a location determined by either the
  <code>ham-process-destination</code> group parameter or a match
  in the <code>gnus-ham-process-destinations</code> variable, which
  is a list of regular expressions matched with group names
  (it&rsquo;s easiest to customize this variable with <kbd>M-x
  customize-variable <span class="key">RET</span>
  gnus-ham-process-destinations</kbd>). Each group name list is a
  standard Lisp list, if you prefer to customize the variable
  manually. If the <code>ham-process-destination</code> parameter
  is not set, ham articles are left in place. If the
  <code>spam-mark-ham-unread-before-move-from-spam-group</code>
  parameter is set, the ham articles are marked as unread before
  being moved.</p>

  <p>If ham can not be moved&mdash;because of a read-only back end
  such as <acronym>NNTP</acronym>, for example, it will be
  copied.</p>

  <p>Note that you can use multiples destinations per group or
  regular expression! This enables you to send your ham to a
  regular mail group and to a <em>ham training</em> group.</p>

  <p>When you leave a <em>ham</em> group, all ham-marked articles
  are sent to a ham processor, which will study these as non-spam
  samples.</p><a name=
  "index-spam_002dprocess_002dham_002din_002dspam_002dgroups" id=
  "index-spam_002dprocess_002dham_002din_002dspam_002dgroups"></a>

  <p>By default the variable
  <code>spam-process-ham-in-spam-groups</code> is <code>nil</code>.
  Set it to <code>t</code> if you want ham found in spam groups to
  be processed. Normally this is not done, you are expected instead
  to send your ham to a ham group and process it there.</p><a name=
  "index-spam_002dprocess_002dham_002din_002dnonham_002dgroups" id=
  "index-spam_002dprocess_002dham_002din_002dnonham_002dgroups"></a>

  <p>By default the variable
  <code>spam-process-ham-in-nonham-groups</code> is
  <code>nil</code>. Set it to <code>t</code> if you want ham found
  in non-ham (spam or unclassified) groups to be processed.
  Normally this is not done, you are expected instead to send your
  ham to a ham group and process it there.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dspam_002dprocess_002ddestinations-1" id=
  "index-gnus_002dspam_002dprocess_002ddestinations-1"></a>

  <p>When you leave a <em>ham</em> or <em>unclassified</em> group,
  all <strong>spam</strong> articles are moved to a location
  determined by either the <code>spam-process-destination</code>
  group parameter or a match in the
  <code>gnus-spam-process-destinations</code> variable, which is a
  list of regular expressions matched with group names (it&rsquo;s
  easiest to customize this variable with <kbd>M-x
  customize-variable <span class="key">RET</span>
  gnus-spam-process-destinations</kbd>). Each group name list is a
  standard Lisp list, if you prefer to customize the variable
  manually. If the <code>spam-process-destination</code> parameter
  is not set, the spam articles are only expired. The group name is
  fully qualified, meaning that if you see
  &lsquo;<samp>nntp:servername</samp>&rsquo; before the group name
  in the group buffer then you need it here as well.</p>

  <p>If spam can not be moved&mdash;because of a read-only back end
  such as <acronym>NNTP</acronym>, for example, it will be
  copied.</p>

  <p>Note that you can use multiples destinations per group or
  regular expression! This enables you to send your spam to
  multiple <em>spam training</em> groups.</p><a name=
  "index-spam_002dlog_002dto_002dregistry" id=
  "index-spam_002dlog_002dto_002dregistry"></a>

  <p>The problem with processing ham and spam is that Gnus
  doesn&rsquo;t track this processing by default. Enable the
  <code>spam-log-to-registry</code> variable so
  <code>spam.el</code> will use <code>gnus-registry.el</code> to
  track what articles have been processed, and avoid processing
  articles multiple times. Keep in mind that if you limit the
  number of registry entries, this won&rsquo;t work as well as it
  does without a limit.</p><a name=
  "index-spam_002dmark_002donly_002dunseen_002das_002dspam" id=
  "index-spam_002dmark_002donly_002dunseen_002das_002dspam"></a>

  <p>Set this variable if you want only unseen articles in spam
  groups to be marked as spam. By default, it is set. If you set it
  to <code>nil</code>, unread articles will also be marked as
  spam.</p><a name=
  "index-spam_002dmark_002dham_002dunread_002dbefore_002dmove_002dfrom_002dspam_002dgroup"
  id=
  "index-spam_002dmark_002dham_002dunread_002dbefore_002dmove_002dfrom_002dspam_002dgroup"></a>

  <p>Set this variable if you want ham to be unmarked before it is
  moved out of the spam group. This is very useful when you use
  something like the tick mark &lsquo;<samp>!</samp>&rsquo; to mark
  ham&mdash;the article will be placed in your
  <code>ham-process-destination</code>, unmarked as if it came
  fresh from the mail server.</p><a name=
  "index-spam_002dautodetect_002drecheck_002dmessages" id=
  "index-spam_002dautodetect_002drecheck_002dmessages"></a>

  <p>When autodetecting spam, this variable tells
  <code>spam.el</code> whether only unseen articles or all unread
  articles should be checked for spam. It is recommended that you
  leave it off.</p>
