  <h4 class="subsection">6.4.1 Mail in a Newsreader</h4>

  <p>If you are used to traditional mail readers, but have decided
  to switch to reading mail with Gnus, you may find yourself
  experiencing something of a culture shock.</p>

  <p>Gnus does not behave like traditional mail readers. If you
  want to make it behave that way, you can, but it&rsquo;s an
  uphill battle.</p>

  <p>Gnus, by default, handles all its groups using the same
  approach. This approach is very newsreaderly&mdash;you enter a
  group, see the new/unread messages, and when you read the
  messages, they get marked as read, and you don&rsquo;t see them
  any more. (Unless you explicitly ask for them.)</p>

  <p>In particular, you do not do anything explicitly to delete
  messages.</p>

  <p>Does this mean that all the messages that have been marked as
  read are deleted? How awful!</p>

  <p>But, no, it means that old messages are <em>expired</em>
  according to some scheme or other. For news messages, the expire
  process is controlled by the news administrator; for mail, the
  expire process is controlled by you. The expire process for mail
  is covered in depth in <a href=
  "Expiring-Mail.html#Expiring-Mail">Expiring Mail</a>.</p>

  <p>What many Gnus users find, after using it a while for both
  news and mail, is that the transport mechanism has very little to
  do with how they want to treat a message.</p>

  <p>Many people subscribe to several mailing lists. These are
  transported via <acronym>SMTP</acronym>, and are therefore mail.
  But we might go for weeks without answering, or even reading
  these messages very carefully. We may not need to save them
  because if we should need to read one again, they are archived
  somewhere else.</p>

  <p>Some people have local news groups which have only a handful
  of readers. These are transported via <acronym>NNTP</acronym>,
  and are therefore news. But we may need to read and answer a
  large fraction of the messages very carefully in order to do our
  work. And there may not be an archive, so we may need to save the
  interesting messages the same way we would personal mail.</p>

  <p>The important distinction turns out to be not the transport
  mechanism, but other factors such as how interested we are in the
  subject matter, or how easy it is to retrieve the message if we
  need to read it again.</p>

  <p>Gnus provides many options for sorting mail into
  &ldquo;groups&rdquo; which behave like newsgroups, and for
  treating each group (whether mail or news) differently.</p>

  <p>Some users never get comfortable using the Gnus (ahem)
  paradigm and wish that Gnus should grow up and be a male, er,
  mail reader. It is possible to whip Gnus into a more mailreaderly
  being, but, as said before, it&rsquo;s not easy. People who
  prefer proper mail readers should try <small>VM</small> instead,
  which is an excellent, and proper, mail reader.</p>

  <p>I don&rsquo;t mean to scare anybody off, but I want to make it
  clear that you may be required to learn a new way of thinking
  about messages. After you&rsquo;ve been subjected to The Gnus
  Way, you will come to love it. I can guarantee it. (At least the
  guy who sold me the Emacs Subliminal Brain-Washing Functions that
  I&rsquo;ve put into Gnus did guarantee it. You Will Be
  Assimilated. You Love Gnus. You Love The Gnus Mail Way. You
  Do.)</p>
