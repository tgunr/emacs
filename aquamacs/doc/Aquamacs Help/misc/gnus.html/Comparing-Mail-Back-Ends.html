  <h4 class="subsubsection">6.4.13.11 Comparing Mail Back Ends</h4>

  <p>First, just for terminology, the <em>back end</em> is the
  common word for a low-level access method&mdash;a transport, if
  you will, by which something is acquired. The sense is that
  one&rsquo;s mail has to come from somewhere, and so selection of
  a suitable back end is required in order to get that mail within
  spitting distance of Gnus.</p>

  <p>The same concept exists for Usenet itself: Though access to
  articles is typically done by <acronym>NNTP</acronym> these days,
  once upon a midnight dreary, everyone in the world got at Usenet
  by running a reader on the machine where the articles lay (the
  machine which today we call an <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server),
  and access was by the reader stepping into the articles&rsquo;
  directory spool area directly. One can still select between
  either the <code>nntp</code> or <code>nnspool</code> back ends,
  to select between these methods, if one happens actually to live
  on the server (or can see its spool directly, anyway, via
  NFS).</p>

  <p>The goal in selecting a mail back end is to pick one which
  simultaneously represents a suitable way of dealing with the
  original format plus leaving mail in a form that is convenient to
  use in the future. Here are some high and low points on each:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt><code>nnmbox</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>UNIX systems have historically had a single, very common,
      and well-defined format. All messages arrive in a single
      <em>spool file</em>, and they are delineated by a line whose
      regular expression matches &lsquo;<samp>^From_</samp>&rsquo;.
      (My notational use of &lsquo;<samp>_</samp>&rsquo; is to
      indicate a space, to make it clear in this instance that this
      is not the RFC-specified &lsquo;<samp>From:</samp>&rsquo;
      header.) Because Emacs and therefore Gnus emanate
      historically from the Unix environment, it is simplest if one
      does not mess a great deal with the original mailbox format,
      so if one chooses this back end, Gnus&rsquo; primary activity
      in getting mail from the real spool area to Gnus&rsquo;
      preferred directory is simply to copy it, with no
      (appreciable) format change in the process. It is the
      &ldquo;dumbest&rdquo; way to move mail into availability in
      the Gnus environment. This makes it fast to move into place,
      but slow to parse, when Gnus has to look at what&rsquo;s
      where.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>nnbabyl</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Once upon a time, there was the DEC-10 and DEC-20, running
      operating systems called TOPS and related things, and the
      usual (only?) mail reading environment was a thing called
      Babyl. I don&rsquo;t know what format was used for mail
      landing on the system, but Babyl had its own internal format
      to which mail was converted, primarily involving creating a
      spool-file-like entity with a scheme for inserting
      Babyl-specific headers and status bits above the top of each
      message in the file. Rmail was Emacs&rsquo;s first mail
      reader, it was written by Richard Stallman, and Stallman came
      out of that TOPS/Babyl environment, so he wrote Rmail to
      understand the mail files folks already had in existence.
      Gnus (and VM, for that matter) continue to support this
      format because it&rsquo;s perceived as having some good
      qualities in those mailer-specific headers/status bits stuff.
      Rmail itself still exists as well, of course, and is still
      maintained within Emacs. Since Emacs 23, it uses standard
      mbox format rather than Babyl.</p>

      <p>Both of the above forms leave your mail in a single file
      on your file system, and they must parse that entire file
      each time you take a look at your mail.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>nnml</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p><code>nnml</code> is the back end which smells the most as
      though you were actually operating with an
      <code>nnspool</code>-accessed Usenet system. (In fact, I
      believe <code>nnml</code> actually derived from
      <code>nnspool</code> code, lo these years ago.) One&rsquo;s
      mail is taken from the original spool file, and is then cut
      up into individual message files, 1:1. It maintains a
      Usenet-style active file (analogous to what one finds in an
      INN- or CNews-based news system in (for instance)
      <samp>/var/lib/news/active</samp>, or what is returned via
      the &lsquo;<samp>NNTP LIST</samp>&rsquo; verb) and also
      creates <em>overview</em> files for efficient group entry, as
      has been defined for <acronym>NNTP</acronym> servers for some
      years now. It is slower in mail-splitting, due to the
      creation of lots of files, updates to the <code>nnml</code>
      active file, and additions to overview files on a per-message
      basis, but it is extremely fast on access because of what
      amounts to the indexing support provided by the active file
      and overviews.</p>

      <p><code>nnml</code> costs <em>inodes</em> in a big way; that
      is, it soaks up the resource which defines available places
      in the file system to put new files. Sysadmins take a dim
      view of heavy inode occupation within tight, shared file
      systems. But if you live on a personal machine where the file
      system is your own and space is not at a premium,
      <code>nnml</code> wins big.</p>

      <p>It is also problematic using this back end if you are
      living in a FAT16-based Windows world, since much space will
      be wasted on all these tiny files.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>nnmh</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The Rand MH mail-reading system has been around UNIX
      systems for a very long time; it operates by splitting
      one&rsquo;s spool file of messages into individual files, but
      with little or no indexing support&mdash;<code>nnmh</code> is
      considered to be semantically equivalent to
      &ldquo;<code>nnml</code> without active file or
      overviews&rdquo;. This is arguably the worst choice, because
      one gets the slowness of individual file creation married to
      the slowness of access parsing when learning what&rsquo;s new
      in one&rsquo;s groups.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>nnfolder</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Basically the effect of <code>nnfolder</code> is
      <code>nnmbox</code> (the first method described above) on a
      per-group basis. That is, <code>nnmbox</code> itself puts
      <em>all</em> one&rsquo;s mail in one file;
      <code>nnfolder</code> provides a little bit of optimization
      to this so that each of one&rsquo;s mail groups has a Unix
      mail box file. It&rsquo;s faster than <code>nnmbox</code>
      because each group can be parsed separately, and still
      provides the simple Unix mail box format requiring minimal
      effort in moving the mail around. In addition, it maintains
      an &ldquo;active&rdquo; file making it much faster for Gnus
      to figure out how many messages there are in each separate
      group.</p>

      <p>If you have groups that are expected to have a massive
      amount of messages, <code>nnfolder</code> is not the best
      choice, but if you receive only a moderate amount of mail,
      <code>nnfolder</code> is probably the most friendly mail back
      end all over.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>nnmaildir</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>For configuring expiry and other things,
      <code>nnmaildir</code> uses incompatible group parameters,
      slightly different from those of other mail back ends.</p>

      <p><code>nnmaildir</code> is largely similar to
      <code>nnml</code>, with some notable differences. Each
      message is stored in a separate file, but the filename is
      unrelated to the article number in Gnus.
      <code>nnmaildir</code> also stores the equivalent of
      <code>nnml</code>&rsquo;s overview files in one file per
      article, so it uses about twice as many inodes as
      <code>nnml</code>. (Use <code>df -i</code> to see how
      plentiful your inode supply is.) If this slows you down or
      takes up very much space, a non-block-structured file
      system.</p>

      <p>Since maildirs don&rsquo;t require locking for delivery,
      the maildirs you use as groups can also be the maildirs your
      mail is directly delivered to. This means you can skip
      Gnus&rsquo; mail splitting if your mail is already organized
      into different mailboxes during delivery. A
      <code>directory</code> entry in <code>mail-sources</code>
      would have a similar effect, but would require one set of
      mailboxes for spooling deliveries (in mbox format, thus
      damaging message bodies), and another set to be used as
      groups (in whatever format you like). A maildir has a
      built-in spool, in the <code>new/</code> subdirectory. Beware
      that currently, mail moved from <code>new/</code> to
      <code>cur/</code> instead of via mail splitting will not
      undergo treatment such as duplicate checking.</p>

      <p><code>nnmaildir</code> stores article marks for a given
      group in the corresponding maildir, in a way designed so that
      it&rsquo;s easy to manipulate them from outside Gnus. You can
      tar up a maildir, unpack it somewhere else, and still have
      your marks.</p>

      <p><code>nnmaildir</code> uses a significant amount of memory
      to speed things up. (It keeps in memory some of the things
      that <code>nnml</code> stores in files and that
      <code>nnmh</code> repeatedly parses out of message files.) If
      this is a problem for you, you can set the
      <code>nov-cache-size</code> group parameter to something
      small (0 would probably not work, but 1 probably would) to
      make it use less memory. This caching will probably be
      removed in the future.</p>

      <p>Startup is likely to be slower with <code>nnmaildir</code>
      than with other back ends. Everything else is likely to be
      faster, depending in part on your file system.</p>

      <p><code>nnmaildir</code> does not use <code>nnoo</code>, so
      you cannot use <code>nnoo</code> to write an
      <code>nnmaildir</code>-derived back end.</p>
