  <h4 class="subsection">6.4.9 Expiring Mail</h4><a name=
  "index-article-expiry" id="index-article-expiry"></a> <a name=
  "index-expiring-mail-7" id="index-expiring-mail-7"></a>

  <p>Traditional mail readers have a tendency to remove mail
  articles when you mark them as read, in some way. Gnus takes a
  fundamentally different approach to mail reading.</p>

  <p>Gnus basically considers mail just to be news that has been
  received in a rather peculiar manner. It does not think that it
  has the power to actually change the mail, or delete any mail
  messages. If you enter a mail group, and mark articles as
  &ldquo;read&rdquo;, or kill them in some other fashion, the mail
  articles will still exist on the system. I repeat: Gnus will not
  delete your old, read mail. Unless you ask it to, of course.</p>

  <p>To make Gnus get rid of your unwanted mail, you have to mark
  the articles as <em>expirable</em>. (With the default key
  bindings, this means that you have to type <kbd>E</kbd>.) This
  does not mean that the articles will disappear right away,
  however. In general, a mail article will be deleted from your
  system if, 1) it is marked as expirable, AND 2) it is more than
  one week old. If you do not mark an article as expirable, it will
  remain on your system until hell freezes over. This bears
  repeating one more time, with some spurious capitalizations: IF
  you do NOT mark articles as EXPIRABLE, Gnus will NEVER delete
  those ARTICLES.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dauto_002dexpirable_002dmarks" id=
  "index-gnus_002dauto_002dexpirable_002dmarks"></a>

  <p>You do not have to mark articles as expirable by hand. Gnus
  provides two features, called &ldquo;auto-expire&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;total-expire&rdquo;, that can help you with this. In a
  nutshell, &ldquo;auto-expire&rdquo; means that Gnus hits
  <kbd>E</kbd> for you when you select an article. And
  &ldquo;total-expire&rdquo; means that Gnus considers all articles
  as expirable that are read. So, in addition to the articles
  marked &lsquo;<samp>E</samp>&rsquo;, also the articles marked
  &lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>R</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>O</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>K</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>Y</samp>&rsquo; (and so on) are considered
  expirable. <code>gnus-auto-expirable-marks</code> has the full
  list of these marks.</p>

  <p>When should either auto-expire or total-expire be used? Most
  people who are subscribed to mailing lists split each list into
  its own group and then turn on auto-expire or total-expire for
  those groups. (See <a href=
  "Splitting-Mail.html#Splitting-Mail">Splitting Mail</a>, for more
  information on splitting each list into its own group.)</p>

  <p>Which one is better, auto-expire or total-expire? It&rsquo;s
  not easy to answer. Generally speaking, auto-expire is probably
  faster. Another advantage of auto-expire is that you get more
  marks to work with: for the articles that are supposed to stick
  around, you can still choose between tick and dormant and read
  marks. But with total-expire, you only have dormant and ticked to
  choose from. The advantage of total-expire is that it works well
  with adaptive scoring (see <a href=
  "Adaptive-Scoring.html#Adaptive-Scoring">Adaptive Scoring</a>).
  Auto-expire works with normal scoring but not with adaptive
  scoring.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dauto_002dexpirable_002dnewsgroups" id=
  "index-gnus_002dauto_002dexpirable_002dnewsgroups"></a>

  <p>Groups that match the regular expression
  <code>gnus-auto-expirable-newsgroups</code> will have all
  articles that you read marked as expirable automatically. All
  articles marked as expirable have an &lsquo;<samp>E</samp>&rsquo;
  in the first column in the summary buffer.</p>

  <p>By default, if you have auto expiry switched on, Gnus will
  mark all the articles you read as expirable, no matter if they
  were read or unread before. To avoid having articles marked as
  read marked as expirable automatically, you can put something
  like the following in your <samp>~/.gnus.el</samp>
  file:</p><a name="index-gnus_002dmark_002darticle_002dhook-1" id=
  "index-gnus_002dmark_002darticle_002dhook-1"></a>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(remove-hook 'gnus-mark-article-hook
             'gnus-summary-mark-read-and-unread-as-read)
(add-hook 'gnus-mark-article-hook 'gnus-summary-mark-unread-as-read)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Note that making a group auto-expirable doesn&rsquo;t mean
  that all read articles are expired&mdash;only the articles marked
  as expirable will be expired. Also note that using the
  <kbd>d</kbd> command won&rsquo;t make articles
  expirable&mdash;only semi-automatic marking of articles as read
  will mark the articles as expirable in auto-expirable groups.</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s say you subscribe to a couple of mailing lists,
  and you want the articles you have read to disappear after a
  while:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(setq gnus-auto-expirable-newsgroups
      "mail.nonsense-list\\|mail.nice-list")
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Another way to have auto-expiry happen is to have the element
  <code>auto-expire</code> in the group parameters of the
  group.</p>

  <p>If you use adaptive scoring (see <a href=
  "Adaptive-Scoring.html#Adaptive-Scoring">Adaptive Scoring</a>)
  and auto-expiring, you&rsquo;ll have problems. Auto-expiring and
  adaptive scoring don&rsquo;t really mix very well.</p><a name=
  "index-nnmail_002dexpiry_002dwait" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dexpiry_002dwait"></a>

  <p>The <code>nnmail-expiry-wait</code> variable supplies the
  default time an expirable article has to live. Gnus starts
  counting days from when the message <em>arrived</em>, not from
  when it was sent. The default is seven days.</p>

  <p>Gnus also supplies a function that lets you fine-tune how long
  articles are to live, based on what group they are in.
  Let&rsquo;s say you want to have one month expiry period in the
  &lsquo;<samp>mail.private</samp>&rsquo; group, a one day expiry
  period in the &lsquo;<samp>mail.junk</samp>&rsquo; group, and a
  six day expiry period everywhere else:</p><a name=
  "index-nnmail_002dexpiry_002dwait_002dfunction-1" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dexpiry_002dwait_002dfunction-1"></a>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(setq nnmail-expiry-wait-function
      (lambda (group)
       (cond ((string= group "mail.private")
               31)
             ((string= group "mail.junk")
               1)
             ((string= group "important")
               'never)
             (t
               6))))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The group names this function is fed are
  &ldquo;unadorned&rdquo; group names&mdash;no
  &lsquo;<samp>nnml:</samp>&rsquo; prefixes and the like.</p>

  <p>The <code>nnmail-expiry-wait</code> variable and
  <code>nnmail-expiry-wait-function</code> function can either be a
  number (not necessarily an integer) or one of the symbols
  <code>immediate</code> or <code>never</code>.</p>

  <p>You can also use the <code>expiry-wait</code> group parameter
  to selectively change the expiry period (see <a href=
  "Group-Parameters.html#Group-Parameters">Group
  Parameters</a>).</p><a name="index-nnmail_002dexpiry_002dtarget"
  id="index-nnmail_002dexpiry_002dtarget"></a>

  <p>The normal action taken when expiring articles is to delete
  them. However, in some circumstances it might make more sense to
  move them to other groups instead of deleting them. The variable
  <code>nnmail-expiry-target</code> (and the
  <code>expiry-target</code> group parameter) controls this. The
  variable supplies a default value for all groups, which can be
  overridden for specific groups by the group parameter. default
  value is <code>delete</code>, but this can also be a string
  (which should be the name of the group the message should be
  moved to), or a function (which will be called in a buffer
  narrowed to the message in question, and with the name of the
  group being moved from as its parameter) which should return a
  target&mdash;either a group name or <code>delete</code>.</p>

  <p>Here&rsquo;s an example for specifying a group name:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(setq nnmail-expiry-target "nnml:expired")
</pre>
  </div><a name="index-nnmail_002dfancy_002dexpiry_002dtarget" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dfancy_002dexpiry_002dtarget"></a> <a name=
  "index-nnmail_002dfancy_002dexpiry_002dtargets" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dfancy_002dexpiry_002dtargets"></a>

  <p>Gnus provides a function
  <code>nnmail-fancy-expiry-target</code> which will expire mail to
  groups according to the variable
  <code>nnmail-fancy-expiry-targets</code>. Here&rsquo;s an
  example:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
 (setq nnmail-expiry-target 'nnmail-fancy-expiry-target
       nnmail-fancy-expiry-targets
       '((to-from "boss" "nnfolder:Work")
         ("subject" "IMPORTANT" "nnfolder:IMPORTANT.%Y.%b")
         ("from" ".*" "nnfolder:Archive-%Y")))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>With this setup, any mail that has <code>IMPORTANT</code> in
  its Subject header and was sent in the year <code>YYYY</code> and
  month <code>MMM</code>, will get expired to the group
  <code>nnfolder:IMPORTANT.YYYY.MMM</code>. If its From or To
  header contains the string <code>boss</code>, it will get expired
  to <code>nnfolder:Work</code>. All other mail will get expired to
  <code>nnfolder:Archive-YYYY</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-nnmail_002dkeep_002dlast_002darticle" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dkeep_002dlast_002darticle"></a>

  <p>If <code>nnmail-keep-last-article</code> is
  non-<code>nil</code>, Gnus will never expire the final article in
  a mail newsgroup. This is to make life easier for procmail
  users.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dtotal_002dexpirable_002dnewsgroups" id=
  "index-gnus_002dtotal_002dexpirable_002dnewsgroups"></a>

  <p>By the way: That line up there, about Gnus never expiring
  non-expirable articles, is a lie. If you put
  <code>total-expire</code> in the group parameters, articles will
  not be marked as expirable, but all read articles will be put
  through the expiry process. Use with extreme caution. Even more
  dangerous is the <code>gnus-total-expirable-newsgroups</code>
  variable. All groups that match this regexp will have all read
  articles put through the expiry process, which means that
  <em>all</em> old mail articles in the groups in question will be
  deleted after a while. Use with extreme caution, and don&rsquo;t
  come crying to me when you discover that the regexp you used
  matched the wrong group and all your important mail has
  disappeared. Be a <em>man</em>! Or a <em>woman</em>! Whatever you
  feel more comfortable with! So there!</p>

  <p>Most people make most of their mail groups total-expirable,
  though.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dinhibit_002duser_002dauto_002dexpire" id=
  "index-gnus_002dinhibit_002duser_002dauto_002dexpire"></a>

  <p>If <code>gnus-inhibit-user-auto-expire</code> is
  non-<code>nil</code>, user marking commands will not mark an
  article as expirable, even if the group has auto-expire turned
  on.</p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dmark_002dcopied_002dor_002dmoved_002darticles_002das_002dexpirable"
  id=
  "index-gnus_002dmark_002dcopied_002dor_002dmoved_002darticles_002das_002dexpirable"></a>

  <p>The expirable marks of articles will be removed when copying
  or moving them to a group in which auto-expire is not turned on.
  This is for preventing articles from being expired
  unintentionally. On the other hand, to a group that has turned
  auto-expire on, the expirable marks of articles that are copied
  or moved will not be changed by default. I.e., when copying or
  moving to such a group, articles that were expirable will be left
  expirable and ones that were not expirable will not be marked as
  expirable. So, even though in auto-expire groups, some articles
  will never get expired (unless you read them again). If you
  don&rsquo;t side with that behavior that unexpirable articles may
  be mixed into auto-expire groups, you can set
  <code>gnus-mark-copied-or-moved-articles-as-expirable</code> to a
  non-<code>nil</code> value. In that case, articles that have been
  read will be marked as expirable automatically when being copied
  or moved to a group that has auto-expire turned on. The default
  value is <code>nil</code>.</p>
