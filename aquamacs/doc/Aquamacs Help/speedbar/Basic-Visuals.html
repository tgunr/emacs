  <h3 class="section">2.2 Basic Visuals</h3>

  <p><a name="index-visuals-10" id="index-visuals-10"></a> Speedbar
  has visual cues for indicating different types of data. These
  cues are used consistently across the different speedbar modes to
  make them easier to interpret.</p>

  <p>At a high level, in File mode, there are directory buttons,
  sub directory buttons, file buttons, tag buttons, and expansion
  buttons. This makes it easy to use the mouse to navigate a
  directory tree, and quickly view files, or a summary of those
  files.</p>

  <p>The most basic visual effect used to distinguish between these
  button types is color and mouse highlighting. Anything the mouse
  highlights can be clicked on and is called a button (see <a href=
  "Mouse-Bindings.html#Mouse-Bindings">Mouse Bindings</a>).
  Anything not highlighted by the mouse will not be clickable.</p>

  <p>Text in speedbar consists of four different types of data.
  Knowing how to read these textual elements will make it easier to
  navigate by identifying the types of data available.</p>

  <h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.0.1 Groups</h5>

  <p><a name="index-groups-11" id="index-groups-11"></a> Groups
  summarize information in a single line, and provide a high level
  view of more complex systems, like a directory tree, or manual
  chapters.</p>

  <p>Groups appear at different indentation levels, and are
  prefixed with a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; in some sort of `box'. The group
  name will summarize the information within it, and the expansion
  box will display that information inline. In File mode,
  directories and files are `groups' where the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  surrounded by brackets like this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     &lt;+&gt; include
     &lt;-&gt; src
      [+] foo.c
</pre>

  <p>In this example, we see both open and closed directories, in
  addition to a file. The directories have a box consisting of
  angle brackets, and a file uses square brackets.</p>

  <p>In all modes, a group can be `edited' by pressing
  <kbd>RET</kbd>, meaning a file will be opened, or a directory
  explicitly opened in speedbar. A group can be expanded or
  contracted using <kbd>+</kbd> or <kbd>-</kbd>. See <a href=
  "Basic-Key-Bindings.html#Basic-Key-Bindings">Basic Key
  Bindings</a>.</p>

  <p>Sometimes groups may have a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; in its indicator box. This means
  that it is a group type, but there are no contents, or no known
  way of extracting contents of that group.</p>

  <p>When a group has been expanded, the indicator button changes
  from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;. This
  indicates that the contents are being shown. Click the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; button to
  contract the group, or hide the contents currently displayed.</p>

  <h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.0.2 Tags</h5>

  <p><a name="index-tags-12" id="index-tags-12"></a> Tags are the
  leaf nodes of the tree system. Tags are generally prefixed with a
  simple character, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;. Tags can only be jumped to
  using <kbd>RET</kbd> or <kbd>e</kbd>.</p>

  <h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.0.3 Boolean Flags</h5>

  <p>Sometimes a group or tag is given a boolean flag. These flags
  appear as extra text characters at the end of the line. File mode
  uses boolean flags, such as a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to indicate that a file has been
  checked out of a versioning system.</p>

  <p>For additional flags, see
  <!-- Note to self, update these to sub-nodes which are more relevant. -->
   <a href="File-Mode.html#File-Mode">File Mode</a>, and <a href=
  "Version-Control.html#Version-Control">Version Control</a>.</p>

  <h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.0.4 Unadorned Text</h5>

  <p>Unadorned text generally starts in column 0, without any
  special symbols prefixing them. In Buffers mode different buffer
  groups are prefixed with a description of what the following
  buffers are (Files, scratch buffers, and invisible buffers.)</p>

  <p>Unadorned text will generally be colorless, and not
  clickable.</p>

  <h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.0.5 Color Cues</h5>

  <p>Each type of Group, item indicator, and label is given a
  different color. The colors chosen are dependent on whether the
  background color is light or dark. Of important note is that the
  `current item', which may be a buffer or file name, is
  highlighted red, and underlined.</p>

  <p>Colors can be customized from the group
  <code>speedbar-faces</code>. Some modes, such as for Info, will
  use the Info colors instead of default speedbar colors as an
  indication of what is currently being displayed.</p>

  <p>The face naming convention mirrors the File display mode.
  Modes which do not use files will attempt to use the same colors
  on analogous entries.</p>
