  <h2 class="chapter">5 Outlining</h2>

  <p>nXML mode allows you to display all or part of a buffer as an
  outline, in a similar way to Emacs' outline mode. An outline in
  nXML mode is based on recognizing two kinds of element: sections
  and headings. There is one heading for every section and one
  section for every heading. A section contains its heading as or
  within its first child element. A section also contains its
  subordinate sections (its subsections). The text content of a
  section consists of anything in a section that is neither a
  subsection nor a heading.</p>

  <p>Note that this is a different model from that used by XHTML.
  nXML mode's outline support will not be useful for XHTML unless
  you adopt a convention of adding a <code>div</code> to enclose
  each section, rather than having sections implicitly delimited by
  different <code>h</code><var>n</var> elements. This limitation
  may be removed in a future version.</p>

  <p>The variable <code>nxml-section-element-name-regexp</code>
  gives a regexp for the local names (i.e. the part of the name
  following any prefix) of section elements. The variable
  <code>nxml-heading-element-name-regexp</code> gives a regexp for
  the local names of heading elements. For an element to be
  recognized as a section</p>

  <ul>
    <li>its start-tag must occur at the beginning of a line
    (possibly indented);</li>

    <li>its local name must match
    <code>nxml-section-element-name-regexp</code>;</li>

    <li>either its first child element or a descendant of that
    first child element must have a local name that matches
    <code>nxml-heading-element-name-regexp</code>; the first such
    element is treated as the section's heading.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="noindent">You can customize these variables using
  <kbd>M-x customize-variable</kbd>.</p>

  <p>There are three possible outline states for a section:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>normal, showing everything, including its heading, text
    content and subsections; each subsection is displayed according
    to the state of that subsection;</li>

    <li>showing just its heading, with both its text content and
    its subsections hidden; all subsections are hidden regardless
    of their state;</li>

    <li>showing its heading and its subsections, with its text
    content hidden; each subsection is displayed according to the
    state of that subsection.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the last two states, where the text content is hidden, the
  heading is displayed specially, in an abbreviated form. An
  element like this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     &lt;section&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Food&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;para&gt;There are many kinds of food.&lt;/para&gt;
     &lt;/section&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">would be displayed on a single line like
  this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     &lt;-section&gt;Food...&lt;/&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">If there are hidden subsections, then a
  <code>+</code> will be used instead of a <code>-</code> like
  this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     &lt;+section&gt;Food...&lt;/&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">If there are non-hidden subsections, then the
  section will instead be displayed like this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     &lt;-section&gt;Food...
       &lt;-section&gt;Delicious Food...&lt;/&gt;
       &lt;-section&gt;Distasteful Food...&lt;/&gt;
     &lt;/-section&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The heading is always displayed with an
  indent that corresponds to its depth in the outline, even it is
  not actually indented in the buffer. The variable
  <code>nxml-outline-child-indent</code> controls how much a
  subheading is indented with respect to its parent heading when
  the heading is being displayed specially.</p>

  <p>Commands to change the outline state of sections are bound to
  key sequences that start with <kbd>C-c C-o</kbd> (<kbd>o</kbd> is
  mnemonic for outline). The third and final key has been chosen to
  be consistent with outline mode. In the following descriptions
  current section means the section containing point, or, more
  precisely, the innermost section containing the character
  immediately following point.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><kbd>C-c C-o C-a</kbd> shows all sections in the buffer
    normally.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-c C-o C-t</kbd> hides the text content of all
    sections in the buffer.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-c C-o C-c</kbd> hides the text content of the
    current section.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-c C-o C-e</kbd> shows the text content of the
    current section.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-c C-o C-d</kbd> hides the text content and
    subsections of the current section.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-c C-o C-s</kbd> shows the current section and all
    its direct and indirect subsections normally.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-c C-o C-k</kbd> shows the headings of the direct and
    indirect subsections of the current section.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-c C-o C-l</kbd> hides the text content of the
    current section and of its direct and indirect
    subsections.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-c C-o C-i</kbd> shows the headings of the direct
    subsections of the current section.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-c C-o C-o</kbd> hides as much as possible without
    hiding the current section's text content; the headings of
    ancestor sections of the current section and their child
    section sections will not be hidden.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When a heading is displayed specially, you can use &lt;RET&gt;
  in that heading to show the text content of the section in the
  same way as <kbd>C-c C-o C-e</kbd>.</p>

  <p>You can also use the mouse to change the outline state:
  <kbd>S-mouse-2</kbd> hides the text content of a section in the
  same way as<kbd>C-c C-o C-c</kbd>; <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on a
  specially displayed heading shows the text content of the section
  in the same way as <kbd>C-c C-o C-e</kbd>; <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on
  a specially displayed start-tag toggles the display of
  subheadings on and off.</p>

  <p>The outline state for each section is stored with the first
  character of the section (as a text property). Every command that
  changes the outline state of any section updates the display of
  the buffer so that each section is displayed correctly according
  to its outline state. If the section structure is subsequently
  changed, then it is possible for the display to no longer
  correctly reflect the stored outline state. <kbd>C-c C-o
  C-r</kbd> can be used to refresh the display so it is correct
  again.</p>
