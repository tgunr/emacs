  <h2 class="chapter">7 DTDs</h2>

  <p>nxml-mode is designed to support the creation of standalone
  XML documents that do not depend on a DTD. Although it is common
  practice to insert a DOCTYPE declaration referencing an external
  DTD, this has undesirable side-effects. It means that the
  document is no longer self-contained. It also means that
  different XML parsers may interpret the document in different
  ways, since the XML Recommendation does not require XML parsers
  to read the DTD. With DTDs, it was impractical to get validation
  without using an external DTD or reference to an parameter
  entity. With RELAX NG and other schema languages, you can
  simulataneously get the benefits of validation and standalone XML
  documents. Therefore, I recommend that you do not reference an
  external DOCTYPE in your XML documents.</p>

  <p>One problem is entities for characters. Typically, as well as
  providing validation, DTDs also provide a set of character
  entities for documents to use. Schemas cannot provide this
  functionality, because schema validation happens after XML
  parsing. The recommended solution is to either use the Unicode
  characters directly, or, if this is impractical, use character
  references. nXML mode supports this by providing commands for
  entering characters and character references using the Unicode
  names, and can display the glyph corresponding to a character
  reference.</p>
