  <h2 class="chapter">4 Paragraphs</h2>

  <p>Emacs has several commands that operate on paragraphs, most
  notably <kbd>M-q</kbd>. nXML mode redefines these to work in a
  way that is useful for XML. The exact rules that are used to find
  the beginning and end of a paragraph are complicated; they are
  designed mainly to ensure that <kbd>M-q</kbd> does the right
  thing.</p>

  <p>A paragraph consists of one or more complete, consecutive
  lines. A group of lines is not considered a paragraph unless it
  contains some non-whitespace characters between tags or inside
  comments. A blank line separates paragraphs. A single tag on a
  line by itself also separates paragraphs. More precisely, if one
  tag together with any leading and trailing whitespace completely
  occupy one or more lines, then those lines will not be included
  in any paragraph.</p>

  <p>A start-tag at the beginning of the line (possibly indented)
  may be treated as starting a paragraph. Similarly, an end-tag at
  the end of the line may be treated as ending a paragraph. The
  following rules are used to determine whether such a tag is in
  fact treated as a paragraph boundary:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the schema does not allow text at that point, then it is
    a paragraph boundary.</li>

    <li>If the end-tag corresponding to the start-tag is not at the
    end of its line, or the start-tag corresponding to the end-tag
    is not at the beginning of its line, then it is not a paragraph
    boundary. For example, in
      <pre class="example">
          &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph with an
          &lt;emph&gt;emphasized&lt;/emph&gt; phrase.
</pre>

      <p class="noindent">the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">&lt;emph&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; start-tag would not
      be considered as starting a paragraph, because its
      corresponding end-tag is not at the end of the line.</p>
    </li>

    <li>If there is text that is a sibling in element tree, then it
    is not a paragraph boundary. For example, in
      <pre class="example">
          &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph with an
          &lt;emph&gt;emphasized phrase that takes one source line&lt;/emph&gt;
</pre>

      <p class="noindent">the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">&lt;emph&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; start-tag would not
      be considered as starting a paragraph, even though its
      end-tag is at the end of its line, because there the text
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">This is a paragraph with
      an</span></samp>&rsquo; is a sibling of the
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emph</span></samp>&rsquo;
      element.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Otherwise, it is a paragraph boundary.</li>
  </ul>
