  <h3 class="section">6.1 Commands for locating a schema</h3>

  <p>The command <kbd>C-c C-s C-w</kbd> will tell you what schema
  is currently being used.</p>

  <p>The rules for locating a schema are applied automatically when
  you visit a file in nXML mode. However, if you have just created
  a new file and the schema cannot be inferred from the file-name,
  then this will not locate the right schema. In this case, you
  should insert the start-tag of the root element and then use the
  command <kbd>C-c C-s C-a</kbd>, which reapplies the rules based
  on the current content of the document. It is usually not
  necessary to insert the complete start-tag; often just
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&lt;</span><var>name</var></samp>&rsquo; is enough.</p>

  <p>If you want to use a schema that has not yet been added to the
  schema locating files, you can use the command <kbd>C-c C-s
  C-f</kbd> to manually select the file containing the schema for
  the document in current buffer. Emacs will read the file-name of
  the schema from the minibuffer. After reading the file-name,
  Emacs will ask whether you wish to add a rule to a schema
  locating file that persistently associates the document with the
  selected schema. The rule will be added to the first file in the
  list specified &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">rng-schema-locating-files</span></samp>&rsquo;; it will
  create the file if necessary, but will not create a directory. If
  the variable &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">rng-schema-locating-files</span></samp>&rsquo; has not
  been customized, this means that the rule will be added to the
  file &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">schemas.xml</span></samp>&rsquo; in the same directory as
  the document being edited.</p>

  <p>The command <kbd>C-c C-s C-t</kbd> allows you to select a
  schema by specifying an identifier for the type of the document.
  The schema locating files determine the available type
  identifiers and what schema is used for each type identifier.
  This is useful when it is impossible to infer the right schema
  from either the file-name or the content of the document, even
  though the schema is already in the schema locating file. A
  situation in which this can occur is when there are multiple
  variants of a schema where all valid documents have the same
  document element. For example, XHTML has Strict and Transitional
  variants. In a situation like this, a schema locating file can
  define a type identifier for each variant. As with <kbd>C-c C-s
  C-f</kbd>, Emacs will ask whether you wish to add a rule to a
  schema locating file that persistently associates the document
  with the specified type identifier.</p>

  <p>The command <kbd>C-c C-s C-l</kbd> adds a rule to a schema
  locating file that persistently associates the document with the
  schema that is currently being used.</p>
