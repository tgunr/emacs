  <h2 class="chapter">2 Overview</h2>

  <p class="noindent">Common Lisp is a huge language, and Common
  Lisp systems tend to be massive and extremely complex. Emacs
  Lisp, by contrast, is rather minimalist in the choice of Lisp
  features it offers the programmer. As Emacs Lisp programmers have
  grown in number, and the applications they write have grown more
  ambitious, it has become clear that Emacs Lisp could benefit from
  many of the conveniences of Common Lisp.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>CL</dfn> package adds a number of Common Lisp
  functions and control structures to Emacs Lisp. While not a 100%
  complete implementation of Common Lisp, <dfn>CL</dfn> adds enough
  functionality to make Emacs Lisp programming significantly more
  convenient.</p>

  <p><strong>Please note:</strong> the <dfn>CL</dfn> functions are
  not standard parts of the Emacs Lisp name space, so it is
  legitimate for users to define them with other, conflicting
  meanings. To avoid conflicting with those user activities, we
  have a policy that packages installed in Emacs must not load
  <dfn>CL</dfn> at run time. (It is ok for them to load
  <dfn>CL</dfn> at compile time only, with
  <code>eval-when-compile</code>, and use the macros it provides.)
  If you are writing packages that you plan to distribute and
  invite widespread use for, you might want to observe the same
  rule.</p>

  <p>Some Common Lisp features have been omitted from this package
  for various reasons:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Some features are too complex or bulky relative to their
    benefit to Emacs Lisp programmers. CLOS and Common Lisp streams
    are fine examples of this group.</li>

    <li>Other features cannot be implemented without modification
    to the Emacs Lisp interpreter itself, such as multiple return
    values, lexical scoping, case-insensitive symbols, and complex
    numbers. The <dfn>CL</dfn> package generally makes no attempt
    to emulate these features.</li>

    <li>Some features conflict with existing things in Emacs Lisp.
    For example, Emacs' <code>assoc</code> function is incompatible
    with the Common Lisp <code>assoc</code>. In such cases, this
    package usually adds the suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to the function name of the
    Common Lisp version of the function (e.g.,
    <code>assoc*</code>).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The package described here was written by Dave Gillespie,
  <samp><span class="file">daveg@synaptics.com</span></samp>. It is
  a total rewrite of the original 1986 <samp><span class=
  "file">cl.el</span></samp> package by Cesar Quiroz. Most features
  of the Quiroz package have been retained; any incompatibilities
  are noted in the descriptions below. Care has been taken in this
  version to ensure that each function is defined efficiently,
  concisely, and with minimal impact on the rest of the Emacs
  environment.</p>
