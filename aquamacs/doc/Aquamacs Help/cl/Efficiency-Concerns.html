  <h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Efficiency Concerns</h2>

  <h3 class="appendixsec">A.1 Macros</h3>

  <p class="noindent">Many of the advanced features of this
  package, such as <code>defun*</code>, <code>loop</code>, and
  <code>setf</code>, are implemented as Lisp macros. In
  byte-compiled code, these complex notations will be expanded into
  equivalent Lisp code which is simple and efficient. For example,
  the forms</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (incf i n)
     (push x (car p))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">are expanded at compile-time to the Lisp
  forms</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (setq i (+ i n))
     (setcar p (cons x (car p)))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">which are the most efficient ways of doing
  these respective operations in Lisp. Thus, there is no
  performance penalty for using the more readable <code>incf</code>
  and <code>push</code> forms in your compiled code.</p>

  <p><em>Interpreted</em> code, on the other hand, must expand
  these macros every time they are executed. For this reason it is
  strongly recommended that code making heavy use of macros be
  compiled. (The features labeled &ldquo;Special Form&rdquo;
  instead of &ldquo;Function&rdquo; in this manual are macros.) A
  loop using <code>incf</code> a hundred times will execute
  considerably faster if compiled, and will also garbage-collect
  less because the macro expansion will not have to be generated,
  used, and thrown away a hundred times.</p>

  <p>You can find out how a macro expands by using the
  <code>cl-prettyexpand</code> function.</p>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Function: <b>cl-prettyexpand</b> <var>form
    &amp;optional full<a name="index-cl_002dprettyexpand-185" id=
    "index-cl_002dprettyexpand-185"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This function takes a single Lisp form as an argument and
      inserts a nicely formatted copy of it in the current buffer
      (which must be in Lisp mode so that indentation works
      properly). It also expands all Lisp macros which appear in
      the form. The easiest way to use this function is to go to
      the <code>*scratch*</code> buffer and type, say,</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (cl-prettyexpand '(loop for x below 10 collect x))
</pre>

      <p class="noindent">and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> immediately
      after the closing parenthesis; the expansion</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (block nil
            (let* ((x 0)
                   (G1004 nil))
              (while (&lt; x 10)
                (setq G1004 (cons x G1004))
                (setq x (+ x 1)))
              (nreverse G1004)))
</pre>

      <p class="noindent">will be inserted into the buffer. (The
      <code>block</code> macro is expanded differently in the
      interpreter and compiler, so <code>cl-prettyexpand</code>
      just leaves it alone. The temporary variable
      <code>G1004</code> was created by <code>gensym</code>.)</p>

      <p>If the optional argument <var>full</var> is true, then
      <em>all</em> macros are expanded, including
      <code>block</code>, <code>eval-when</code>, and compiler
      macros. Expansion is done as if <var>form</var> were a
      top-level form in a file being compiled. For example,</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (cl-prettyexpand '(pushnew 'x list))
               -| (setq list (adjoin 'x list))
          (cl-prettyexpand '(pushnew 'x list) t)
               -| (setq list (if (memq 'x list) list (cons 'x list)))
          (cl-prettyexpand '(caddr (member* 'a list)) t)
               -| (car (cdr (cdr (memq 'a list))))
</pre>

      <p>Note that <code>adjoin</code>, <code>caddr</code>, and
      <code>member*</code> all have built-in compiler macros to
      optimize them in common cases.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <h3 class="appendixsec">A.2 Error Checking</h3>

  <p class="noindent">Common Lisp compliance has in general not
  been sacrificed for the sake of efficiency. A few exceptions have
  been made for cases where substantial gains were possible at the
  expense of marginal incompatibility.</p>

  <p>The Common Lisp standard (as embodied in Steele's book) uses
  the phrase &ldquo;it is an error if&rdquo; to indicate a
  situation which is not supposed to arise in complying programs;
  implementations are strongly encouraged but not required to
  signal an error in these situations. This package sometimes omits
  such error checking in the interest of compactness and
  efficiency. For example, <code>do</code> variable specifiers are
  supposed to be lists of one, two, or three forms; extra forms are
  ignored by this package rather than signaling a syntax error. The
  <code>endp</code> function is simply a synonym for
  <code>null</code> in this package. Functions taking keyword
  arguments will accept an odd number of arguments, treating the
  trailing keyword as if it were followed by the value
  <code>nil</code>.</p>

  <p>Argument lists (as processed by <code>defun*</code> and
  friends) <em>are</em> checked rigorously except for the minor
  point just mentioned; in particular, keyword arguments are
  checked for validity, and <code>&amp;allow-other-keys</code> and
  <code>:allow-other-keys</code> are fully implemented. Keyword
  validity checking is slightly time consuming (though not too bad
  in byte-compiled code); you can use
  <code>&amp;allow-other-keys</code> to omit this check. Functions
  defined in this package such as <code>find</code> and
  <code>member*</code> do check their keyword arguments for
  validity.</p>

  <h3 class="appendixsec">A.3 Optimizing Compiler</h3>

  <p class="noindent">Use of the optimizing Emacs compiler is
  highly recommended; many of the Common Lisp macros emit code
  which can be improved by optimization. In particular,
  <code>block</code>s (whether explicit or implicit in constructs
  like <code>defun*</code> and <code>loop</code>) carry a fair
  run-time penalty; the optimizing compiler removes
  <code>block</code>s which are not actually referenced by
  <code>return</code> or <code>return-from</code> inside the
  block.</p>
