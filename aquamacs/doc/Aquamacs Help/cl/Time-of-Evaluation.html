  <h3 class="section">3.2 Time of Evaluation</h3>

  <p class="noindent">Normally, the byte-compiler does not actually
  execute the forms in a file it compiles. For example, if a file
  contains <code>(setq foo t)</code>, the act of compiling it will
  not actually set <code>foo</code> to <code>t</code>. This is true
  even if the <code>setq</code> was a top-level form (i.e., not
  enclosed in a <code>defun</code> or other form). Sometimes,
  though, you would like to have certain top-level forms evaluated
  at compile-time. For example, the compiler effectively evaluates
  <code>defmacro</code> forms at compile-time so that later parts
  of the file can refer to the macros that are defined.</p>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Special Form: <b>eval-when</b>
    (<var>situations...</var>) <var>forms...<a name=
    "index-eval_002dwhen-5" id=
    "index-eval_002dwhen-5"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This form controls when the body <var>forms</var> are
      evaluated. The <var>situations</var> list may contain any set
      of the symbols <code>compile</code>, <code>load</code>, and
      <code>eval</code> (or their long-winded ANSI equivalents,
      <code>:compile-toplevel</code>, <code>:load-toplevel</code>,
      and <code>:execute</code>).</p>

      <p>The <code>eval-when</code> form is handled differently
      depending on whether or not it is being compiled as a
      top-level form. Specifically, it gets special treatment if it
      is being compiled by a command such as
      <code>byte-compile-file</code> which compiles files or
      buffers of code, and it appears either literally at the top
      level of the file or inside a top-level
      <code>progn</code>.</p>

      <p>For compiled top-level <code>eval-when</code>s, the body
      <var>forms</var> are executed at compile-time if
      <code>compile</code> is in the <var>situations</var> list,
      and the <var>forms</var> are written out to the file (to be
      executed at load-time) if <code>load</code> is in the
      <var>situations</var> list.</p>

      <p>For non-compiled-top-level forms, only the
      <code>eval</code> situation is relevant. (This includes forms
      executed by the interpreter, forms compiled with
      <code>byte-compile</code> rather than
      <code>byte-compile-file</code>, and non-top-level forms.) The
      <code>eval-when</code> acts like a <code>progn</code> if
      <code>eval</code> is specified, and like <code>nil</code>
      (ignoring the body <var>forms</var>) if not.</p>

      <p>The rules become more subtle when <code>eval-when</code>s
      are nested; consult Steele (second edition) for the gruesome
      details (and some gruesome examples).</p>

      <p>Some simple examples:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          ;; Top-level forms in foo.el:
          (eval-when (compile)           (setq foo1 'bar))
          (eval-when (load)              (setq foo2 'bar))
          (eval-when (compile load)      (setq foo3 'bar))
          (eval-when (eval)              (setq foo4 'bar))
          (eval-when (eval compile)      (setq foo5 'bar))
          (eval-when (eval load)         (setq foo6 'bar))
          (eval-when (eval compile load) (setq foo7 'bar))
</pre>

      <p>When <samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp> is
      compiled, these variables will be set during the compilation
      itself:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          foo1  foo3  foo5  foo7      ; `compile'
</pre>

      <p>When <samp><span class="file">foo.elc</span></samp> is
      loaded, these variables will be set:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          foo2  foo3  foo6  foo7      ; `load'
</pre>

      <p>And if <samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp> is
      loaded uncompiled, these variables will be set:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          foo4  foo5  foo6  foo7      ; `eval'
</pre>

      <p>If these seven <code>eval-when</code>s had been, say,
      inside a <code>defun</code>, then the first three would have
      been equivalent to <code>nil</code> and the last four would
      have been equivalent to the corresponding
      <code>setq</code>s.</p>

      <p>Note that <code>(eval-when (load eval) ...)</code> is
      equivalent to <code>(progn ...)</code> in all contexts. The
      compiler treats certain top-level forms, like
      <code>defmacro</code> (sort-of) and <code>require</code>, as
      if they were wrapped in <code>(eval-when (compile load eval)
      ...)</code>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <p>Emacs includes two special forms related to
  <code>eval-when</code>. One of these,
  <code>eval-when-compile</code>, is not quite equivalent to any
  <code>eval-when</code> construct and is described below.</p>

  <p>The other form, <code>(eval-and-compile ...)</code>, is
  exactly equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(eval-when
  (compile load eval) ...)</span></samp>&rsquo; and so is not
  itself defined by this package.</p>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Special Form: <b>eval-when-compile</b>
    <var>forms...<a name="index-eval_002dwhen_002dcompile-6" id=
    "index-eval_002dwhen_002dcompile-6"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>The <var>forms</var> are evaluated at compile-time; at
      execution time, this form acts like a quoted constant of the
      resulting value. Used at top-level,
      <code>eval-when-compile</code> is just like
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">eval-when (compile
      eval)</span></samp>&rsquo;. In other contexts,
      <code>eval-when-compile</code> allows code to be evaluated
      once at compile-time for efficiency or other reasons.</p>

      <p>This form is similar to the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">#.</span></samp>&rsquo; syntax of true Common
      Lisp.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Special Form: <b>load-time-value</b> <var>form<a name=
    "index-load_002dtime_002dvalue-7" id=
    "index-load_002dtime_002dvalue-7"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>The <var>form</var> is evaluated at load-time; at
      execution time, this form acts like a quoted constant of the
      resulting value.</p>

      <p>Early Common Lisp had a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">#,</span></samp>&rsquo; syntax that was similar to
      this, but ANSI Common Lisp replaced it with
      <code>load-time-value</code> and gave it more well-defined
      semantics.</p>

      <p>In a compiled file, <code>load-time-value</code> arranges
      for <var>form</var> to be evaluated when the
      <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> file is loaded
      and then used as if it were a quoted constant. In code
      compiled by <code>byte-compile</code> rather than
      <code>byte-compile-file</code>, the effect is identical to
      <code>eval-when-compile</code>. In uncompiled code, both
      <code>eval-when-compile</code> and
      <code>load-time-value</code> act exactly like
      <code>progn</code>.</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (defun report ()
            (insert "This function was executed on: "
                    (current-time-string)
                    ", compiled on: "
                    (eval-when-compile (current-time-string))
                    ;; or '#.(current-time-string) in real Common Lisp
                    ", and loaded on: "
                    (load-time-value (current-time-string))))
</pre>

      <p class="noindent">Byte-compiled, the above defun will
      result in the following code (or its compiled equivalent, of
      course) in the <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp>
      file:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (setq --temp-- (current-time-string))
          (defun report ()
            (insert "This function was executed on: "
                    (current-time-string)
                    ", compiled on: "
                    '"Wed Jun 23 18:33:43 1993"
                    ", and loaded on: "
                    --temp--))
</pre>
