  <h2 class="appendix">Appendix C Old CL Compatibility</h2>

  <p class="noindent">Following is a list of all known
  incompatibilities between this package and the older Quiroz
  <samp><span class="file">cl.el</span></samp> package.</p>

  <p>This package's emulation of multiple return values in
  functions is incompatible with that of the older package. That
  package attempted to come as close as possible to true Common
  Lisp multiple return values; unfortunately, it could not be 100%
  reliable and so was prone to occasional surprises if used freely.
  This package uses a simpler method, namely replacing multiple
  values with lists of values, which is more predictable though
  more noticeably different from Common Lisp.</p>

  <p>The <code>defkeyword</code> form and <code>keywordp</code>
  function are not implemented in this package.</p>

  <p>The <code>member</code>, <code>floor</code>,
  <code>ceiling</code>, <code>truncate</code>, <code>round</code>,
  <code>mod</code>, and <code>rem</code> functions are suffixed by
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in this
  package to avoid collision with existing functions in Emacs. The
  older package simply redefined these functions, overwriting the
  built-in meanings and causing serious portability problems. (Some
  more recent versions of the Quiroz package changed the names to
  <code>cl-member</code>, etc.; this package defines the latter
  names as aliases for <code>member*</code>, etc.)</p>

  <p>Certain functions in the old package which were buggy or
  inconsistent with the Common Lisp standard are incompatible with
  the conforming versions in this package. For example,
  <code>eql</code> and <code>member</code> were synonyms for
  <code>eq</code> and <code>memq</code> in that package,
  <code>setf</code> failed to preserve correct order of evaluation
  of its arguments, etc.</p>

  <p>Finally, unlike the older package, this package is careful to
  prefix all of its internal names with <code>cl-</code>. Except
  for a few functions which are explicitly defined as additional
  features (such as <code>floatp-safe</code> and
  <code>letf</code>), this package does not export any
  non-&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cl-</span></samp>&rsquo;
  symbols which are not also part of Common Lisp.</p>

  <h3 class="appendixsec">C.1 The <code>cl-compat</code>
  package</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The <dfn>CL</dfn> package includes emulations
  of some features of the old <samp><span class=
  "file">cl.el</span></samp>, in the form of a compatibility
  package <code>cl-compat</code>. This file is obsolete and may be
  removed in future, so it should not be used in new code.</p>

  <p>The old package defined a number of internal routines without
  <code>cl-</code> prefixes or other annotations. Call to these
  routines may have crept into existing Lisp code.
  <code>cl-compat</code> provides emulations of the following
  internal routines: <code>pair-with-newsyms</code>,
  <code>zip-lists</code>, <code>unzip-lists</code>,
  <code>reassemble-arglists</code>,
  <code>duplicate-symbols-p</code>, <code>safe-idiv</code>.</p>

  <p>Some <code>setf</code> forms translated into calls to internal
  functions that user code might call directly. The functions
  <code>setnth</code>, <code>setnthcdr</code>, and
  <code>setelt</code> fall in this category; they are defined by
  <code>cl-compat</code>, but the best fix is to change to use
  <code>setf</code> properly.</p>

  <p>The <code>cl-compat</code> file defines the keyword functions
  <code>keywordp</code>, <code>keyword-of</code>, and
  <code>defkeyword</code>, which are not defined by the new
  <dfn>CL</dfn> package because the use of keywords as data is
  discouraged.</p>

  <p>The <code>build-klist</code> mechanism for parsing keyword
  arguments is emulated by <code>cl-compat</code>; the
  <code>with-keyword-args</code> macro is not, however, and in any
  case it's best to change to use the more natural keyword argument
  processing offered by <code>defun*</code>.</p>

  <p>Multiple return values are treated differently by the two
  Common Lisp packages. The old package's method was more
  compatible with true Common Lisp, though it used heuristics that
  caused it to report spurious multiple return values in certain
  cases. The <code>cl-compat</code> package defines a set of
  multiple-value macros that are compatible with the old CL
  package; again, they are heuristic in nature, but they are
  guaranteed to work in any case where the old package's macros
  worked. To avoid name collision with the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
  multiple-value facilities, the ones in <code>cl-compat</code>
  have capitalized names: <code>Values</code>,
  <code>Values-list</code>, <code>Multiple-value-bind</code>,
  etc.</p>

  <p>The functions <code>cl-floor</code>, <code>cl-ceiling</code>,
  <code>cl-truncate</code>, and <code>cl-round</code> are defined
  by <code>cl-compat</code> to use the old-style multiple-value
  mechanism, just as they did in the old package. The newer
  <code>floor*</code> and friends return their two results in a
  list rather than as multiple values. Note that older versions of
  the old package used the unadorned names <code>floor</code>,
  <code>ceiling</code>, etc.; <code>cl-compat</code> cannot use
  these names because they conflict with Emacs built-ins.</p>
