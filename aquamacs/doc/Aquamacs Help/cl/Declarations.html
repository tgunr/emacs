  <h2 class="chapter">7 Declarations</h2>

  <p class="noindent">Common Lisp includes a complex and powerful
  &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; mechanism that allows you to give the
  compiler special hints about the types of data that will be
  stored in particular variables, and about the ways those
  variables and functions will be used. This package defines
  versions of all the Common Lisp declaration forms:
  <code>declare</code>, <code>locally</code>,
  <code>proclaim</code>, <code>declaim</code>, and
  <code>the</code>.</p>

  <p>Most of the Common Lisp declarations are not currently useful
  in Emacs Lisp, as the byte-code system provides little
  opportunity to benefit from type information, and
  <code>special</code> declarations are redundant in a fully
  dynamically-scoped Lisp. A few declarations are meaningful when
  the optimizing byte compiler is being used, however. Under the
  earlier non-optimizing compiler, these declarations will
  effectively be ignored.</p>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Function: <b>proclaim</b> <var>decl-spec<a name=
    "index-proclaim-58" id="index-proclaim-58"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This function records a &ldquo;global&rdquo; declaration
      specified by <var>decl-spec</var>. Since
      <code>proclaim</code> is a function, <var>decl-spec</var> is
      evaluated and thus should normally be quoted.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Special Form: <b>declaim</b>
    <var>decl-specs<small class="dots">...</small><a name=
    "index-declaim-59" id="index-declaim-59"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This macro is like <code>proclaim</code>, except that it
      takes any number of <var>decl-spec</var> arguments, and the
      arguments are unevaluated and unquoted. The
      <code>declaim</code> macro also puts an <code>(eval-when
      (compile load eval) ...)</code> around the declarations so
      that they will be registered at compile-time as well as at
      run-time. (This is vital, since normally the declarations are
      meant to influence the way the compiler treats the rest of
      the file that contains the <code>declaim</code> form.)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Special Form: <b>declare</b>
    <var>decl-specs<small class="dots">...</small><a name=
    "index-declare-60" id="index-declare-60"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This macro is used to make declarations within functions
      and other code. Common Lisp allows declarations in various
      locations, generally at the beginning of any of the many
      &ldquo;implicit <code>progn</code>s&rdquo; throughout Lisp
      syntax, such as function bodies, <code>let</code> bodies,
      etc. Currently the only declaration understood by
      <code>declare</code> is <code>special</code>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Special Form: <b>locally</b>
    <var>declarations<small class="dots">...</small>
    forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-locally-61"
    id="index-locally-61"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>In this package, <code>locally</code> is no different from
      <code>progn</code>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Special Form: <b>the</b> <var>type form<a name=
    "index-the-62" id="index-the-62"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>Type information provided by <code>the</code> is ignored
      in this package; in other words, <code>(the</code>
      <var>type</var> <var>form</var><code>)</code> is equivalent
      to <var>form</var>. Future versions of the optimizing
      byte-compiler may make use of this information.</p>

      <p>For example, <code>mapcar</code> can map over both lists
      and arrays. It is hard for the compiler to expand
      <code>mapcar</code> into an in-line loop unless it knows
      whether the sequence will be a list or an array ahead of
      time. With <code>(mapcar 'car (the vector foo))</code>, a
      future compiler would have enough information to expand the
      loop in-line. For now, Emacs Lisp will treat the above code
      as exactly equivalent to <code>(mapcar 'car foo)</code>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <p>Each <var>decl-spec</var> in a <code>proclaim</code>,
  <code>declaim</code>, or <code>declare</code> should be a list
  beginning with a symbol that says what kind of declaration it is.
  This package currently understands <code>special</code>,
  <code>inline</code>, <code>notinline</code>,
  <code>optimize</code>, and <code>warn</code> declarations. (The
  <code>warn</code> declaration is an extension of standard Common
  Lisp.) Other Common Lisp declarations, such as <code>type</code>
  and <code>ftype</code>, are silently ignored.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>special</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Since all variables in Emacs Lisp are &ldquo;special&rdquo;
      (in the Common Lisp sense), <code>special</code> declarations
      are only advisory. They simply tell the optimizing byte
      compiler that the specified variables are intentionally being
      referred to without being bound in the body of the function.
      The compiler normally emits warnings for such references,
      since they could be typographical errors for references to
      local variables.

      <p>The declaration <code>(declare (special</code>
      <var>var1</var> <var>var2</var><code>))</code> is equivalent
      to <code>(defvar</code> <var>var1</var><code>) (defvar</code>
      <var>var2</var><code>)</code> in the optimizing compiler, or
      to nothing at all in older compilers (which do not warn for
      non-local references).</p>

      <p>In top-level contexts, it is generally better to write
      <code>(defvar</code> <var>var</var><code>)</code> than
      <code>(declaim (special</code> <var>var</var><code>))</code>,
      since <code>defvar</code> makes your intentions clearer. But
      the older byte compilers can not handle <code>defvar</code>s
      appearing inside of functions, while <code>(declare
      (special</code> <var>var</var><code>))</code> takes care to
      work correctly with all compilers.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>inline</code></dt>

    <dd>
      The <code>inline</code> <var>decl-spec</var> lists one or
      more functions whose bodies should be expanded
      &ldquo;in-line&rdquo; into calling functions whenever the
      compiler is able to arrange for it. For example, the Common
      Lisp function <code>cadr</code> is declared
      <code>inline</code> by this package so that the form
      <code>(cadr</code> <var>x</var><code>)</code> will expand
      directly into <code>(car (cdr</code>
      <var>x</var><code>))</code> when it is called in user
      functions, for a savings of one (relatively expensive)
      function call.

      <p>The following declarations are all equivalent. Note that
      the <code>defsubst</code> form is a convenient way to define
      a function and declare it inline all at once.</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (declaim (inline foo bar))
          (eval-when (compile load eval) (proclaim '(inline foo bar)))
          (defsubst foo (...) ...)       ; instead of defun
</pre>

      <p><strong>Please note:</strong> this declaration remains in
      effect after the containing source file is done. It is
      correct to use it to request that a function you have defined
      should be inlined, but it is impolite to use it to request
      inlining of an external function.</p>

      <p>In Common Lisp, it is possible to use <code>(declare
      (inline ...))</code> before a particular call to a function
      to cause just that call to be inlined; the current byte
      compilers provide no way to implement this, so <code>(declare
      (inline ...))</code> is currently ignored by this
      package.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>notinline</code></dt>

    <dd>The <code>notinline</code> declaration lists functions
    which should not be inlined after all; it cancels a previous
    <code>inline</code> declaration.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>optimize</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This declaration controls how much optimization is performed
      by the compiler. Naturally, it is ignored by the earlier
      non-optimizing compilers.

      <p>The word <code>optimize</code> is followed by any number
      of lists like <code>(speed 3)</code> or <code>(safety
      2)</code>. Common Lisp defines several optimization
      &ldquo;qualities&rdquo;; this package ignores all but
      <code>speed</code> and <code>safety</code>. The value of a
      quality should be an integer from 0 to 3, with 0 meaning
      &ldquo;unimportant&rdquo; and 3 meaning &ldquo;very
      important.&rdquo; The default level for both qualities is
      1.</p>

      <p>In this package, with the optimizing compiler, the
      <code>speed</code> quality is tied to the
      <code>byte-compile-optimize</code> flag, which is set to
      <code>nil</code> for <code>(speed 0)</code> and to
      <code>t</code> for higher settings; and the
      <code>safety</code> quality is tied to the
      <code>byte-compile-delete-errors</code> flag, which is set to
      <code>t</code> for <code>(safety 3)</code> and to
      <code>nil</code> for all lower settings. (The latter flag
      controls whether the compiler is allowed to optimize out code
      whose only side-effect could be to signal an error, e.g.,
      rewriting <code>(progn foo bar)</code> to <code>bar</code>
      when it is not known whether <code>foo</code> will be bound
      at run-time.)</p>

      <p>Note that even compiling with <code>(safety 0)</code>, the
      Emacs byte-code system provides sufficient checking to
      prevent real harm from being done. For example, barring
      serious bugs in Emacs itself, Emacs will not crash with a
      segmentation fault just because of an error in a
      fully-optimized Lisp program.</p>

      <p>The <code>optimize</code> declaration is normally used in
      a top-level <code>proclaim</code> or <code>declaim</code> in
      a file; Common Lisp allows it to be used with
      <code>declare</code> to set the level of optimization locally
      for a given form, but this will not work correctly with the
      current version of the optimizing compiler. (The
      <code>declare</code> will set the new optimization level, but
      that level will not automatically be unset after the
      enclosing form is done.)<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>warn</code></dt>

    <dd>This declaration controls what sorts of warnings are
    generated by the byte compiler. Again, only the optimizing
    compiler generates warnings. The word <code>warn</code> is
    followed by any number of &ldquo;warning qualities,&rdquo;
    similar in form to optimization qualities. The currently
    supported warning types are <code>redefine</code>,
    <code>callargs</code>, <code>unresolved</code>, and
    <code>free-vars</code>; in the current system, a value of 0
    will disable these warnings and any higher value will enable
    them. See the documentation for the optimizing byte compiler
    for details.</dd>
