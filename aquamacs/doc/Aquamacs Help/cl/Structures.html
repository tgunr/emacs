  <h2 class="chapter">12 Structures</h2>

  <p class="noindent">The Common Lisp <dfn>structure</dfn>
  mechanism provides a general way to define data types similar to
  C's <code>struct</code> types. A structure is a Lisp object
  containing some number of <dfn>slots</dfn>, each of which can
  hold any Lisp data object. Functions are provided for accessing
  and setting the slots, creating or copying structure objects, and
  recognizing objects of a particular structure type.</p>

  <p>In true Common Lisp, each structure type is a new type
  distinct from all existing Lisp types. Since the underlying Emacs
  Lisp system provides no way to create new distinct types, this
  package implements structures as vectors (or lists upon request)
  with a special &ldquo;tag&rdquo; symbol to identify them.</p>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Special Form: <b>defstruct</b> <var>name
    slots<small class="dots">...</small><a name=
    "index-defstruct-181" id="index-defstruct-181"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>The <code>defstruct</code> form defines a new structure
      type called <var>name</var>, with the specified
      <var>slots</var>. (The <var>slots</var> may begin with a
      string which documents the structure type.) In the simplest
      case, <var>name</var> and each of the <var>slots</var> are
      symbols. For example,</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (defstruct person name age sex)
</pre>

      <p class="noindent">defines a struct type called
      <code>person</code> which contains three slots. Given a
      <code>person</code> object <var>p</var>, you can access those
      slots by calling <code>(person-name</code>
      <var>p</var><code>)</code>, <code>(person-age</code>
      <var>p</var><code>)</code>, and <code>(person-sex</code>
      <var>p</var><code>)</code>. You can also change these slots
      by using <code>setf</code> on any of these place forms:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (incf (person-age birthday-boy))
</pre>

      <p>You can create a new <code>person</code> by calling
      <code>make-person</code>, which takes keyword arguments
      <code>:name</code>, <code>:age</code>, and <code>:sex</code>
      to specify the initial values of these slots in the new
      object. (Omitting any of these arguments leaves the
      corresponding slot &ldquo;undefined,&rdquo; according to the
      Common Lisp standard; in Emacs Lisp, such uninitialized slots
      are filled with <code>nil</code>.)</p>

      <p>Given a <code>person</code>, <code>(copy-person</code>
      <var>p</var><code>)</code> makes a new object of the same
      type whose slots are <code>eq</code> to those of
      <var>p</var>.</p>

      <p>Given any Lisp object <var>x</var>, <code>(person-p</code>
      <var>x</var><code>)</code> returns true if <var>x</var> looks
      like a <code>person</code>, false otherwise. (Again, in
      Common Lisp this predicate would be exact; in Emacs Lisp the
      best it can do is verify that <var>x</var> is a vector of the
      correct length which starts with the correct tag symbol.)</p>

      <p>Accessors like <code>person-name</code> normally check
      their arguments (effectively using <code>person-p</code>) and
      signal an error if the argument is the wrong type. This check
      is affected by <code>(optimize (safety ...))</code>
      declarations. Safety level 1, the default, uses a somewhat
      optimized check that will detect all incorrect arguments, but
      may use an uninformative error message (e.g., &ldquo;expected
      a vector&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;expected a
      <code>person</code>&rdquo;). Safety level 0 omits all checks
      except as provided by the underlying <code>aref</code> call;
      safety levels 2 and 3 do rigorous checking that will always
      print a descriptive error message for incorrect inputs. See
      <a href=
      "Declarations.html#Declarations">Declarations</a>.</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (setq dave (make-person :name "Dave" :sex 'male))
               &rArr; [cl-struct-person "Dave" nil male]
          (setq other (copy-person dave))
               &rArr; [cl-struct-person "Dave" nil male]
          (eq dave other)
               &rArr; nil
          (eq (person-name dave) (person-name other))
               &rArr; t
          (person-p dave)
               &rArr; t
          (person-p [1 2 3 4])
               &rArr; nil
          (person-p "Bogus")
               &rArr; nil
          (person-p '[cl-struct-person counterfeit person object])
               &rArr; t
</pre>

      <p>In general, <var>name</var> is either a name symbol or a
      list of a name symbol followed by any number of <dfn>struct
      options</dfn>; each <var>slot</var> is either a slot symbol
      or a list of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">(</span><var>slot-name</var> <var>default-value</var>
      <var>slot-options</var><span class=
      "samp">...)</span></samp>&rsquo;. The
      <var>default-value</var> is a Lisp form which is evaluated
      any time an instance of the structure type is created without
      specifying that slot's value.</p>

      <p>Common Lisp defines several slot options, but the only one
      implemented in this package is <code>:read-only</code>. A
      non-<code>nil</code> value for this option means the slot
      should not be <code>setf</code>-able; the slot's value is
      determined when the object is created and does not change
      afterward.</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (defstruct person
            (name nil :read-only t)
            age
            (sex 'unknown))
</pre>

      <p>Any slot options other than <code>:read-only</code> are
      ignored.</p>

      <p>For obscure historical reasons, structure options take a
      different form than slot options. A structure option is
      either a keyword symbol, or a list beginning with a keyword
      symbol possibly followed by arguments. (By contrast, slot
      options are key-value pairs not enclosed in lists.)</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (defstruct (person (:constructor create-person)
                             (:type list)
                             :named)
            name age sex)
</pre>

      <p>The following structure options are recognized.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><code>:conc-name</code></dt>

        <dd>The argument is a symbol whose print name is used as
        the prefix for the names of slot accessor functions. The
        default is the name of the struct type followed by a
        hyphen. The option <code>(:conc-name p-)</code> would
        change this prefix to <code>p-</code>. Specifying
        <code>nil</code> as an argument means no prefix, so that
        the slot names themselves are used to name the accessor
        functions.<br /></dd>

        <dt><code>:constructor</code></dt>

        <dd>
          In the simple case, this option takes one argument which
          is an alternate name to use for the constructor function.
          The default is <code>make-</code><var>name</var>, e.g.,
          <code>make-person</code>. The above example changes this
          to <code>create-person</code>. Specifying
          <code>nil</code> as an argument means that no standard
          constructor should be generated at all.

          <p>In the full form of this option, the constructor name
          is followed by an arbitrary argument list. See <a href=
          "Program-Structure.html#Program-Structure">Program
          Structure</a>, for a description of the format of Common
          Lisp argument lists. All options, such as
          <code>&amp;rest</code> and <code>&amp;key</code>, are
          supported. The argument names should match the slot
          names; each slot is initialized from the corresponding
          argument. Slots whose names do not appear in the argument
          list are initialized based on the
          <var>default-value</var> in their slot descriptor. Also,
          <code>&amp;optional</code> and <code>&amp;key</code>
          arguments which don't specify defaults take their
          defaults from the slot descriptor. It is valid to include
          arguments which don't correspond to slot names; these are
          useful if they are referred to in the defaults for
          optional, keyword, or <code>&amp;aux</code> arguments
          which <em>do</em> correspond to slots.</p>

          <p>You can specify any number of full-format
          <code>:constructor</code> options on a structure. The
          default constructor is still generated as well unless you
          disable it with a simple-format <code>:constructor</code>
          option.</p>
          <pre class="example">
               (defstruct
                (person
                 (:constructor nil)   ; no default constructor
                 (:constructor new-person (name sex &amp;optional (age 0)))
                 (:constructor new-hound (&amp;key (name "Rover")
                                               (dog-years 0)
                                          &amp;aux (age (* 7 dog-years))
                                               (sex 'canine))))
                name age sex)
</pre>

          <p>The first constructor here takes its arguments
          positionally rather than by keyword. (In official Common
          Lisp terminology, constructors that work By Order of
          Arguments instead of by keyword are called &ldquo;BOA
          constructors.&rdquo; No, I'm not making this up.) For
          example, <code>(new-person "Jane" 'female)</code>
          generates a person whose slots are <code>"Jane"</code>,
          0, and <code>female</code>, respectively.</p>

          <p>The second constructor takes two keyword arguments,
          <code>:name</code>, which initializes the
          <code>name</code> slot and defaults to
          <code>"Rover"</code>, and <code>:dog-years</code>, which
          does not itself correspond to a slot but which is used to
          initialize the <code>age</code> slot. The
          <code>sex</code> slot is forced to the symbol
          <code>canine</code> with no syntax for overriding
          it.<br /></p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>:copier</code></dt>

        <dd>The argument is an alternate name for the copier
        function for this type. The default is
        <code>copy-</code><var>name</var>. <code>nil</code> means
        not to generate a copier function. (In this implementation,
        all copier functions are simply synonyms for
        <code>copy-sequence</code>.)<br /></dd>

        <dt><code>:predicate</code></dt>

        <dd>
          The argument is an alternate name for the predicate which
          recognizes objects of this type. The default is
          <var>name</var><code>-p</code>. <code>nil</code> means
          not to generate a predicate function. (If the
          <code>:type</code> option is used without the
          <code>:named</code> option, no predicate is ever
          generated.)

          <p>In true Common Lisp, <code>typep</code> is always able
          to recognize a structure object even if
          <code>:predicate</code> was used. In this package,
          <code>typep</code> simply looks for a function called
          <var>typename</var><code>-p</code>, so it will work for
          structure types only if they used the default predicate
          name.<br /></p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>:include</code></dt>

        <dd>
          This option implements a very limited form of C++-style
          inheritance. The argument is the name of another
          structure type previously created with
          <code>defstruct</code>. The effect is to cause the new
          structure type to inherit all of the included structure's
          slots (plus, of course, any new slots described by this
          struct's slot descriptors). The new structure is
          considered a &ldquo;specialization&rdquo; of the included
          one. In fact, the predicate and slot accessors for the
          included type will also accept objects of the new type.

          <p>If there are extra arguments to the
          <code>:include</code> option after the included-structure
          name, these options are treated as replacement slot
          descriptors for slots in the included structure, possibly
          with modified default values. Borrowing an example from
          Steele:</p>
          <pre class="example">
               (defstruct person name (age 0) sex)
                    &rArr; person
               (defstruct (astronaut (:include person (age 45)))
                 helmet-size
                 (favorite-beverage 'tang))
                    &rArr; astronaut

               (setq joe (make-person :name "Joe"))
                    &rArr; [cl-struct-person "Joe" 0 nil]
               (setq buzz (make-astronaut :name "Buzz"))
                    &rArr; [cl-struct-astronaut "Buzz" 45 nil nil tang]

               (list (person-p joe) (person-p buzz))
                    &rArr; (t t)
               (list (astronaut-p joe) (astronaut-p buzz))
                    &rArr; (nil t)

               (person-name buzz)
                    &rArr; "Buzz"
               (astronaut-name joe)
                    &rArr; error: "astronaut-name accessing a non-astronaut"
</pre>

          <p>Thus, if <code>astronaut</code> is a specialization of
          <code>person</code>, then every <code>astronaut</code> is
          also a <code>person</code> (but not the other way
          around). Every <code>astronaut</code> includes all the
          slots of a <code>person</code>, plus extra slots that are
          specific to astronauts. Operations that work on people
          (like <code>person-name</code>) work on astronauts just
          like other people.<br /></p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>:print-function</code></dt>

        <dd>In full Common Lisp, this option allows you to specify
        a function which is called to print an instance of the
        structure type. The Emacs Lisp system offers no hooks into
        the Lisp printer which would allow for such a feature, so
        this package simply ignores
        <code>:print-function</code>.<br /></dd>

        <dt><code>:type</code></dt>

        <dd>
          The argument should be one of the symbols
          <code>vector</code> or <code>list</code>. This tells
          which underlying Lisp data type should be used to
          implement the new structure type. Vectors are used by
          default, but <code>(:type list)</code> will cause
          structure objects to be stored as lists instead.

          <p>The vector representation for structure objects has
          the advantage that all structure slots can be accessed
          quickly, although creating vectors is a bit slower in
          Emacs Lisp. Lists are easier to create, but take a
          relatively long time accessing the later slots.<br /></p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>:named</code></dt>

        <dd>
          This option, which takes no arguments, causes a
          characteristic &ldquo;tag&rdquo; symbol to be stored at
          the front of the structure object. Using
          <code>:type</code> without also using <code>:named</code>
          will result in a structure type stored as plain vectors
          or lists with no identifying features.

          <p>The default, if you don't specify <code>:type</code>
          explicitly, is to use named vectors. Therefore,
          <code>:named</code> is only useful in conjunction with
          <code>:type</code>.</p>
          <pre class="example">
               (defstruct (person1) name age sex)
               (defstruct (person2 (:type list) :named) name age sex)
               (defstruct (person3 (:type list)) name age sex)

               (setq p1 (make-person1))
                    &rArr; [cl-struct-person1 nil nil nil]
               (setq p2 (make-person2))
                    &rArr; (person2 nil nil nil)
               (setq p3 (make-person3))
                    &rArr; (nil nil nil)

               (person1-p p1)
                    &rArr; t
               (person2-p p2)
                    &rArr; t
               (person3-p p3)
                    &rArr; error: function person3-p undefined
</pre>

          <p>Since unnamed structures don't have tags,
          <code>defstruct</code> is not able to make a useful
          predicate for recognizing them. Also, accessors like
          <code>person3-name</code> will be generated but they will
          not be able to do any type checking. The
          <code>person3-name</code> function, for example, will
          simply be a synonym for <code>car</code> in this case. By
          contrast, <code>person2-name</code> is able to verify
          that its argument is indeed a <code>person2</code> object
          before proceeding.<br /></p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>:initial-offset</code></dt>

        <dd>The argument must be a nonnegative integer. It
        specifies a number of slots to be left &ldquo;empty&rdquo;
        at the front of the structure. If the structure is named,
        the tag appears at the specified position in the list or
        vector; otherwise, the first slot appears at that position.
        Earlier positions are filled with <code>nil</code> by the
        constructors and ignored otherwise. If the type
        <code>:include</code>s another type, then
        <code>:initial-offset</code> specifies a number of slots to
