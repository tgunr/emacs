  <h3 class="section">3.1 Topic Interface</h3>

  <p><a name="index-topic-interface-11" id=
  "index-topic-interface-11"></a> The topic interface is accessed
  principally via the command <code>woman</code>. The same command
  can be accessed via the menu item &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Help-&gt;Manuals-&gt;Read Man Page
  (WoMan)...</span></samp>&rsquo; once WoMan has been loaded. The
  command reads a manual topic in the minibuffer, which can be the
  <dfn>basename</dfn> of a man file anywhere in the man file
  structure. The &ldquo;basename&rdquo; in this context means the
  filename without any directory component and without any
  extension or suffix components that relate to the file type. So,
  for example, if there is a compressed source file in Chapter 5 of
  the UNIX Programmer's Manual with the full pathname
  <samp><span class=
  "file">/usr/local/man/man5/man.conf.5.gz</span></samp> then the
  topic is <code>man.conf</code>. Provided WoMan is configured
  correctly, this topic will appear among the completions offered
  by <code>woman</code>. If more than one file has the same topic
  name then WoMan will prompt for which file to format. Completion
  of topics is case insensitive.</p>

  <p>Clearly, <code>woman</code> has to know where to look for man
  files and there are two customizable user options that store this
  information: <code>woman-manpath</code> and
  <code>woman-path</code>. See <a href=
  "Interface-Options.html#Interface-Options">Interface Options</a>.
  If <code>woman-manpath</code> is not set explicitly then WoMan
  tries to pick up the information that would be used by the
  <code>man</code> command, as follows. If the environment variable
  <code>MANPATH</code> is set, which seems to be the standard
  mechanism under UNIX, then WoMan parses that. Otherwise, if WoMan
  can find a configuration file named (by default)
  <samp><span class="file">man.conf</span></samp> (or something
  very similar), which seems to be the standard mechanism under
  GNU/Linux, then it parses that. To be precise, &ldquo;something
  very similar&rdquo; means starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">man</span></samp>&rsquo; and ending with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.conf</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  possibly more lowercase letters, e.g. <samp><span class=
  "file">manual.configuration</span></samp>. The search path and/or
  precise full path name for this file are set by the value of the
  customizable user option <code>woman-man.conf-path</code>. If all
  else fails, WoMan uses a plausible default man search path.</p>

  <p>If the above default configuration does not work correctly for
  any reason then simply customize the value of
  <code>woman-manpath</code>. To access man files that are not in a
  conventional man file hierarchy, customize the value of
  <code>woman-path</code> to include the directories containing the
  files. In this way, <code>woman</code> can access manual files
  <em>anywhere</em> in the entire file system.</p>

  <p>There are two differences between <code>woman-manpath</code>
  and <code>woman-path</code>. Firstly, the elements of
  <code>woman-manpath</code> must be directories that contain
  <em>directories of</em> man files, whereas the elements of
  <code>woman-path</code> must be directories that contain man
  files <em>directly</em>. Secondly, the last directory component
  of each element of <code>woman-path</code> is treated as a
  regular (Emacs) match expression rather than a fixed name, which
  allows collections of related directories to be specified
  succinctly. Also, elements of <code>woman-manpath</code> can be
  conses, indicating a mapping from &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">PATH</span></samp>&rsquo; environment variable components
  to man directory hierarchies.</p>

  <p>For topic completion to work, WoMan must build a list of all
  the manual files that it can access, which can be very slow,
  especially if a network is involved. For this reason, it caches
  various amounts of information, after which retrieving it from
  the cache is very fast. If the cache ever gets out of synchronism
  with reality, running the <code>woman</code> command with a
  prefix argument (e.g. <kbd>C-u M-x woman</kbd>) will force it to
  rebuild its cache. This is necessary only if the names or
  locations of any man files change; it is not necessary if only
  their contents change. It would always be necessary if such a
  change occurred whilst Emacs were running and after WoMan has
  been loaded. It may be necessary if such a change occurs between
  Emacs sessions and persistent caching is used, although WoMan can
  detect some changes that invalidate its cache and rebuild it
  automatically.</p>

  <p>Customize the variable <code>woman-cache-filename</code> to
  save the cache between Emacs sessions. This is recommended only
  if the <code>woman</code> command is too slow the first time it
  is run in an Emacs session, while it builds its cache in main
  memory, which <em>may</em> be <em>very</em> slow. See <a href=
  "Cache.html#Cache">The WoMan Topic Cache</a>, for further
  details.</p>
