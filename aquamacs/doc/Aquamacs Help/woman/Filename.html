  <h3 class="section">3.2 Filename Interface</h3>

  <p><a name="index-filename-interface-16" id=
  "index-filename-interface-16"></a> The commands in this family
  are completely independent of the topic interface, caching
  mechanism, etc.</p>

  <p><a name="index-woman_002dfind_002dfile-17" id=
  "index-woman_002dfind_002dfile-17"></a>The filename interface is
  accessed principally via the extended command
  <code>woman-find-file</code>, which is available without any
  configuration at all (provided WoMan is installed and loaded or
  set up to autoload). This command can be used to browse any
  accessible man file, regardless of its filename or location. If
  the file is compressed then automatic file decompression must
  already be turned on (e.g. see the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Help-&gt;Options</span></samp>&rsquo; submenu)&mdash;it is
  turned on automatically only by the <code>woman</code> topic
  interface.</p>

  <p><a name="index-woman_002ddired_002dfind_002dfile-18" id=
  "index-woman_002ddired_002dfind_002dfile-18"></a>Once WoMan is
  loaded (or if specially set up), various additional commands in
  this family are available. In a dired buffer, the command
  <code>woman-dired-find-file</code> allows the file on the same
  line as point to be formatted and browsed by WoMan. It is bound
  to the key <kbd>W</kbd> in the dired mode map and added to the
  dired major mode menu. It may also be bound to <kbd>w</kbd>,
  unless this key is bound by another library, which it is by
  <code>dired-x</code>, for example. Because it is quite likely
  that other libraries will extend the capabilities of such a
  commonly used mode as dired, the precise key bindings added by
  WoMan to the dired mode map are controlled by the user option
  <code>woman-dired-keys</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-woman_002dtar_002dextract_002dfile-19" id=
  "index-woman_002dtar_002dextract_002dfile-19"></a>When a tar
  (Tape ARchive) file is visited in Emacs, it is opened in tar
  mode, which parses the tar file and shows a dired-like view of
  its contents. The WoMan command
  <code>woman-tar-extract-file</code> allows the file on the same
  line as point to be formatted and browsed by WoMan. It is bound
  to the key <kbd>w</kbd> in the tar mode map and added to the tar
  major mode menu.</p>

  <p>The command <code>woman-reformat-last-file</code>, which is
  bound to the key <kbd>R</kbd> in WoMan mode and available on the
  major mode menu, reformats the last file formatted by WoMan. This
  may occasionally be useful if formatting parameters, such as the
  fill column, are changed, or perhaps if the buffer is somehow
  corrupted.</p>

  <p><a name="index-woman_002ddecode_002dbuffer-20" id=
  "index-woman_002ddecode_002dbuffer-20"></a>The command
  <code>woman-decode-buffer</code> can be used to decode and browse
  the current buffer if it is visiting a man file, although it is
  primarily used internally by WoMan.</p>
