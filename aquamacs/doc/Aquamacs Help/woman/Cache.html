  <h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 The WoMan Topic Cache</h4>

  <p><a name="index-topic-cache-12" id=
  "index-topic-cache-12"></a><a name="index-cache_002c-topic-13"
  id="index-cache_002c-topic-13"></a> The amount of information
  that WoMan caches (in main memory and, optionally, saved to disc)
  is controlled by the user option <code>woman-cache-level</code>.
  There is a trade-off between the speed with which WoMan can find
  a file and the size of the cache, and the default setting gives a
  reasonable compromise.</p>

  <p>The <code>woman</code> command always performs a certain
  amount of caching in main memory, but it can also write its cache
  to the filestore as a persistent cache under control of the user
  option <code>woman-cache-filename</code>. If persistent caching
  is turned on then WoMan re-loads its internal cache from the
  cache file almost instantaneously, so that there is never any
  perceptible start-up delay <em>except</em> when WoMan rebuilds
  its cache. Persistent caching is currently turned off by default.
  This is because users with persistent caching turned on may
  overlook the need to force WoMan to rebuild its cache the first
  time they run it after they have installed new man files; with
  persistent caching turned off, WoMan automatically rebuilds its
  cache every time it is run in a new Emacs session.</p>

  <p>A prefix argument always causes the <code>woman</code> command
  (only) to rebuild its topic cache, and to re-save it to
  <code>woman-cache-filename</code> if this variable has a
  non-<code>nil</code> value. This is necessary if the
  <em>names</em> of any of the directories or files in the paths
  specified by <code>woman-manpath</code> or
  <code>woman-path</code> change. If WoMan user options that affect
  the cache are changed then WoMan will automatically update its
  cache file on disc (if one is in use) the next time it is run in
  a new Emacs session.</p>
