  <h2 class="chapter">2 Background</h2>

  <p><a name="index-background-2" id="index-background-2"></a>
  WoMan is a browser for traditional Unix-style manual page
  documentation. Each such document is conventionally referred to
  as a <dfn>manual page</dfn>, or <dfn>man page</dfn> for short,
  even though some are very much longer than one page. A man page
  is a document written using the Unix &ldquo;man&rdquo; macros,
  which are themselves written in the nroff/troff text processing
  markup language. <code>nroff</code> and <code>troff</code> are
  text processors originally written for the UNIX operating system
  by Joseph F. Ossanna at Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New
  Jersey, USA. They are closely related, and except in the few
  cases where the distinction between them is important I will
  refer to them both ambiguously as <code>roff</code>.</p>

  <p><code>roff</code> markup consists of <dfn>requests</dfn> and
  <dfn>escape sequences</dfn>. A request occupies a complete line
  and begins with either a period or a single forward quote. An
  escape sequences is embedded within the input text and begins (by
  default) with a backslash. The original man macro package defines
  20 new <code>roff</code> requests implemented as macros, which
  were considered to be sufficient for writing man pages. But
  whilst in principle man pages use only the man macros, in
  practice a significant number use many other <code>roff</code>
  requests.</p>

  <p>The distinction between <code>troff</code> and
  <code>nroff</code> is that <code>troff</code> was designed to
  drive a phototypesetter whereas <code>nroff</code> was designed
  to produce essentially <acronym>ASCII</acronym> output for a
  character-based device similar to a teletypewriter (usually
  abbreviated to &ldquo;teletype&rdquo; or &ldquo;tty&rdquo;).
  Hence, <code>troff</code> supports much finer control over output
  positioning than does <code>nroff</code> and can be seen as a
  forerunner of TeX. Traditionally, man pages are either formatted
  by <code>troff</code> for typesetting or by <code>nroff</code>
  for printing on a character printer or displaying on a screen. Of
  course, over the last 25 years or so, the distinction between
  typeset output on paper and characters on a screen has become
  blurred by the fact that most screens now support bit-mapped
  displays, so that any information that can be printed can also be
  rendered on screen, the only difference being the resolution.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Unix-style manual page documentation is still
  normally browsed on screen by running a program called
  <code>man</code>. This program looks in a predefined set of
  directories for the man page matching a specified topic, then
  either formats the source file by running <code>nroff</code> or
  recovers a pre-formatted file, and displays it via a pager such
  as <code>more</code>. <code>nroff</code> normally formats for a
  printer, so it paginates the output, numbers the pages, etc.,
  most of which is irrelevant when the document is browsed as a
  continuous scrollable document on screen. The only concession to
  on-screen browsing normally implemented by the <code>man</code>
  program is to squeeze consecutive blank lines into a single blank
  line.</p>

  <p>For some time, Emacs has offered an improved interface for
  browsing man pages in the form of the Emacs <code>man</code> (or
  <code>manual-entry</code>) command, see <a href=
  "../emacs/Documentation.html#Documentation">man</a>. This command
  runs <code>man</code> as described above, perhaps in the
  background, and then post-processes the output to remove much of
  the <code>nroff</code> pagination such as page headers and
  footers, and places the result into an Emacs buffer. It puts this
  buffer into a special major mode, which is tailored for man page
  browsing, and provides a number of useful navigation commands,
  support for following references, etc. It provides some support
  for special display faces (fonts), but no special menu or mouse
  support. The Emacs man package appears to have been developed
  over about 10 years, from the late 1980s to the late 1990s.</p>

  <p>There is considerable inefficiency in having
  <code>nroff</code> paginate a document and then removing most of
  the pagination!</p>

  <p>WoMan is an Emacs Lisp library that provides an emulation of
  the functionality of the Emacs <code>man</code> command, the main
  difference being that WoMan does not use any external programs.
  The only situation in which WoMan might use an external program
  is when the source file is compressed, when WoMan will use the
  standard Emacs automatic decompression facility, which does call
  an external program.</p>

  <p>I began developing WoMan in the Spring of 1997 and the first
  version was released in May 1997. The original motivation for
  WoMan was the fact that many GNU and Unix programs are ported to
  other platforms and come with Unix-style manual page
  documentation. This may be difficult to read because ports of the
  Unix-style <code>man</code> program can be a little awkward to
  set up. I decided that it should not be too hard to emulate the
  20 <code>man</code> macros directly, without treating them as
  macros and largely ignoring the underlying <code>roff</code>
  requests, given the text processing capabilities of Emacs. This
  proved to be essentially true, and it did not take a great deal
  of work to be able to format simple man pages acceptably.</p>

  <p>One problem arose with the significant number of man pages
  that use <code>roff</code> requests in addition to the
  <code>man</code> macros, and since releasing the first version of
  WoMan I have been continually extending it to support more
  <code>roff</code> requests. WoMan can now format a significant
  proportion of the man pages that I have tested, either well or at
  least readably. However, I have added capabilities partly by
  making additional passes through the document, a design that is
  fundamentally flawed. This can only be solved by a major
  re-design of WoMan to handle the major formatting within a single
  recursive pass, rather than the present multiple passes without
  any significant recursion. There are some <code>roff</code>
  requests that cannot be handled satisfactorily within the present
  design. Some of these are currently handled by kludges that
  &ldquo;usually more or less work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The principle advantage of WoMan is that it does not require
  <code>man</code>, and indeed the name WoMan is a contraction of
  &ldquo;without man.&rdquo; But it has other advantages. It does
  not paginate the document, so it does not need to un-paginate it
  again, thereby saving time. It could take full advantage of the
  display capabilities available to it, and I hope to develop WoMan
  to take advantage of developments in Emacs itself. At present,
  WoMan uses several display faces to support bold and italic text,
  to indicate other fonts, etc. The default faces are also colored,
  but the choice of faces is customizable. WoMan provides menu
  support for navigation and mouse support for following
  references, in addition to the navigation facilities provided by
  <code>man</code> mode. WoMan has (this) texinfo
  documentation!</p>

  <p>WoMan <em>does not</em> replace <code>man</code>, although it
  does use a number of the facilities implemented in the Emacs
  <code>man</code> library. WoMan and man can happily co-exist,
  which is very useful for comparison and debugging purposes.</p>

  <p><code>nroff</code> simulates non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
  characters by using one or more <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
  characters. WoMan should be able to do much better than this. I
  have recently begun to add support for WoMan to use more of the
  characters in its default font and to use a symbol font, and it
  is an aspect that I intend to develop further in the near future.
  It should be possible to move WoMan from an emulation of
  <code>nroff</code> to an emulation of <code>troff</code> as GNU
  Emacs moves to providing bit-mapped display facilities.</p>
