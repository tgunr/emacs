  <h3 class="section">1.11 Mailing Lists</h3>

  <p><a name="index-Mail_002dFollowup_002dTo-31" id=
  "index-Mail_002dFollowup_002dTo-31"></a>Sometimes while posting
  to mailing lists, the poster needs to direct followups to the
  post to specific places. The Mail-Followup-To (MFT) was created
  to enable just this. Three example scenarios where this is
  useful:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A mailing list poster can use MFT to express that responses
    should be sent to just the list, and not the poster as well.
    This will happen if the poster is already subscribed to the
    list.</li>

    <li>A mailing list poster can use MFT to express that responses
    should be sent to the list and the poster as well. This will
    happen if the poster is not subscribed to the list.</li>

    <li>If a message is posted to several mailing lists, MFT may
    also be used to direct the following discussion to one list
    only, because discussions that are spread over several lists
    tend to be fragmented and very difficult to follow.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Gnus honors the MFT header in other's messages (i.e. while
  following up to someone else's post) and also provides support
  for generating sensible MFT headers for outgoing messages as
  well. <!-- @menu -->

   <!-- @node Composing with a MFT header --></p>

  <h4 class="subsection">1.11.1 Composing a correct MFT header
  automagically</h4>

  <p>The first step in getting Gnus to automagically generate a MFT
  header in posts you make is to give Gnus a list of the mailing
  lists addresses you are subscribed to. You can do this in more
  than one way. The following variables would come in handy.
  <a name="index-message_002dsubscribed_002daddresses-32" id=
  "index-message_002dsubscribed_002daddresses-32"></a></p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>message-subscribed-addresses</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This should be a list of addresses the user is subscribed to.
      Its default value is <code>nil</code>. Example:
      <pre class="lisp">
          (setq message-subscribed-addresses
                '("ding@gnus.org" "bing@noose.org"))
</pre>

      <p><a name="index-message_002dsubscribed_002dregexps-33" id=
      "index-message_002dsubscribed_002dregexps-33"></a><br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>message-subscribed-regexps</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This should be a list of regexps denoting the addresses of
      mailing lists subscribed to. Default value is
      <code>nil</code>. Example: If you want to achieve the same
      result as above:
      <pre class="lisp">
          (setq message-subscribed-regexps
                '("\\(ding@gnus\\)\\|\\(bing@noose\\)\\.org")
</pre>

      <p><a name=
      "index-message_002dsubscribed_002daddress_002dfunctions-34"
      id=
      "index-message_002dsubscribed_002daddress_002dfunctions-34"></a><br />
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>message-subscribed-address-functions</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This can be a list of functions to be called (one at a
      time!!) to determine the value of MFT headers. It is
      advisable that these functions not take any arguments.
      Default value is <code>nil</code>.

      <p>There is a pre-defined function in Gnus that is a good
      candidate for this variable.
      <code>gnus-find-subscribed-addresses</code> is a function
      that returns a list of addresses corresponding to the groups
      that have the <code>subscribed</code> (see <a href=
      "../gnus/Group-Parameters.html#Group-Parameters">Group
      Parameters</a>) group parameter set to a non-<code>nil</code>
      value. This is how you would do it.</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (setq message-subscribed-address-functions
                '(gnus-find-subscribed-addresses))
</pre>

      <p><a name=
      "index-message_002dsubscribed_002daddress_002dfile-35" id=
      "index-message_002dsubscribed_002daddress_002dfile-35"></a><br />
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>message-subscribed-address-file</code></dt>

    <dd>You might be one organized human freak and have a list of
    addresses of all subscribed mailing lists in a separate file!
    Then you can just set this variable to the name of the file and
    life would be good.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>You can use one or more of the above variables. All their
  values are &ldquo;added&rdquo; in some way that works :-)</p>

  <p>Now you are all set. Just start composing a message as you
  normally do. And just send it; as always. Just before the message
  is sent out, Gnus' MFT generation thingy kicks in and checks if
  the message already has a MFT field. If there is one, it is left
  alone. (Except if it's empty - in that case, the field is removed
  and is not replaced with an automatically generated one. This
  lets you disable MFT generation on a per-message basis.) If there
  is none, then the list of recipient addresses (in the To: and Cc:
  headers) is checked to see if one of them is a list address you
  are subscribed to. If none of them is a list address, then no MFT
  is generated; otherwise, a MFT is added to the other headers and
  set to the value of all addresses in To: and Cc:</p>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002df-C_002da-36" id=
  "index-C_002dc-C_002df-C_002da-36"></a><a name=
  "index-message_002dgenerate_002dunsubscribed_002dmail_002dfollowup_002dto-37"
  id=
  "index-message_002dgenerate_002dunsubscribed_002dmail_002dfollowup_002dto-37"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002df-C_002dm-38"
  id="index-C_002dc-C_002df-C_002dm-38"></a><a name=
  "index-message_002dgoto_002dmail_002dfollowup_002dto-39" id=
  "index-message_002dgoto_002dmail_002dfollowup_002dto-39"></a>Hm.
  &ldquo;So&rdquo;, you ask, &ldquo;what if I send an email to a
  list I am not subscribed to? I want my MFT to say that I want an
  extra copy.&rdquo; (This is supposed to be interpreted by others
  the same way as if there were no MFT, but you can use an explicit
  MFT to override someone else's to-address group parameter.) The
  function
  <code>message-generate-unsubscribed-mail-followup-to</code> might
  come in handy. It is bound to <kbd>C-c C-f C-a</kbd> by default.
  In any case, you can insert a MFT of your own choice; <kbd>C-c
  C-f C-m</kbd> (<code>message-goto-mail-followup-to</code>) will
  help you get started. <!-- @node Honoring an MFT post --></p>

  <h4 class="subsection">1.11.2 Honoring an MFT post</h4>

  <p><a name=
  "index-message_002duse_002dmail_002dfollowup_002dto-40" id=
  "index-message_002duse_002dmail_002dfollowup_002dto-40"></a>When
  you followup to a post on a mailing list, and the post has a MFT
  header, Gnus' action will depend on the value of the variable
  <code>message-use-mail-followup-to</code>. This variable can be
  one of:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>use</code></dt>

    <dd>Always honor MFTs. The To: and Cc: headers in your followup
    will be derived from the MFT header of the original post. This
    is the default.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>nil</code></dt>

    <dd>Always dishonor MFTs (just ignore the darned
    thing)<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>ask</code></dt>

    <dd>Gnus will prompt you for an action.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>It is considered good netiquette to honor MFT, as it is
  assumed the fellow who posted a message knows where the followups
  need to go better than you do.</p>
