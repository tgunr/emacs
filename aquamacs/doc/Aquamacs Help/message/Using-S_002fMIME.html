  <h4 class="subsection">2.7.2 Using S/MIME</h4>

  <p><em>Note!</em> This section assume you have a basic
  familiarity with modern cryptography, <acronym>S/MIME</acronym>,
  various PKCS standards, OpenSSL and so on.</p>

  <p>The <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> support in Message (and
  <acronym>MML</acronym>) require OpenSSL. OpenSSL performs the
  actual <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> sign/encrypt operations. OpenSSL
  can be found at <a href=
  "http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a>. OpenSSL
  0.9.6 and later should work. Version 0.9.5a cannot extract mail
  addresses from certificates, and it insert a spurious CR
  character into <acronym>MIME</acronym> separators so you may wish
  to avoid it if you would like to avoid being regarded as someone
  who send strange mail. (Although by sending
  <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> messages you've probably already lost
  that contest.)</p>

  <p>To be able to send encrypted mail, a personal certificate is
  not required. Message (<acronym>MML</acronym>) need a certificate
  for the person to whom you wish to communicate with though.
  You're asked for this when you type <kbd>C-c C-m c s</kbd>.
  Currently there are two ways to retrieve this certificate, from a
  local file or from DNS. If you chose a local file, it need to
  contain a X.509 certificate in <acronym>PEM</acronym> format. If
  you chose DNS, you're asked for the domain name where the
  certificate is stored, the default is a good guess. To my belief,
  Message (<acronym>MML</acronym>) is the first mail agent in the
  world to support retrieving <acronym>S/MIME</acronym>
  certificates from DNS, so you're not likely to find very many
  certificates out there. At least there should be one, stored at
  the domain <code>simon.josefsson.org</code>. LDAP is a more
  popular method of distributing certificates, support for it is
  planned. (Meanwhile, you can use <code>ldapsearch</code> from the
  command line to retrieve a certificate into a file and use
  it.)</p>

  <p>As for signing messages, OpenSSL can't perform signing
  operations without some kind of configuration. Especially, you
  need to tell it where your private key and your certificate is
  stored. <acronym>MML</acronym> uses an Emacs interface to
  OpenSSL, aptly named <code>smime.el</code>, and it contain a
  <code>custom</code> group used for this configuration. So, try
  <kbd>M-x customize-group RET smime RET</kbd> and look around.</p>

  <p>Currently there is no support for talking to a CA (or RA) to
  create your own certificate. None is planned either. You need to
  do this manually with OpenSSL or using some other program. I used
  Netscape and got a free <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> certificate
  from one of the big CA's on the net. Netscape is able to export
  your private key and certificate in PKCS #12 format. Use OpenSSL
  to convert this into a plain X.509 certificate in PEM format as
  follows.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     $ openssl pkcs12 -in ns.p12 -clcerts -nodes &gt; key+cert.pem
</pre>

  <p>The <samp><span class="file">key+cert.pem</span></samp> file
  should be pointed to from the <code>smime-keys</code> variable.
  You should now be able to send signed mail.</p>

  <p><em>Note!</em> Your private key is now stored unencrypted in
  the file, so take care in handling it. Storing encrypted keys on
  the disk are supported, and Gnus will ask you for a passphrase
  before invoking OpenSSL. Read the OpenSSL documentation for how
  to achieve this. If you use unencrypted keys (e.g., if they are
  on a secure storage, or if you are on a secure single user
  machine) simply press <code>RET</code> at the passphrase
  prompt.</p>
