  <h2 class="chapter">2 Introduction</h2>

  <p>Todo lists, schedules, phone databases... everything we use
  databases for is really just a way to extend the power of our
  memory, to be able to remember what our conscious mind may not
  currently have access to.</p>

  <p>There are many different databases out there&mdash;and good
  ones&mdash;which this mode is not trying to replace. Rather, it's
  how that data gets there that's the question. Most of the time,
  we just want to say "Remember so-and-so's phone number, or that I
  have to buy dinner for the cats tonight." That's the FACT. How
  it's stored is really the computer's problem. But at this point
  in time, it's most definitely also the user's problem, and
  sometimes so laboriously so that people just let data slip,
  rather than expend the effort to record it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember&rdquo; is a mode for remembering data. It uses
  whatever back-end is appropriate to record and correlate the
  data, but its main intention is to allow you to express as
  <em>little</em> structure as possible up front. If you later want
  to express more powerful relationships between your data, or
  state assumptions that were at first too implicit to be
  recognized, you can &ldquo;study&rdquo; the data later and
  rearrange it. But the initial &ldquo;just remember this&rdquo;
  impulse should be as close to simply throwing the data at Emacs
  as possible.</p>

  <p>Have you ever noticed that having a laptop to write on doesn't
  <em>actually</em> increase the amount of quality material that
  you turn out, in the long run? Perhaps it's because the time we
  save electronically in one way, we're losing electronically in
  another; the tool should never dominate one's focus. As the
  mystic Faridu'd-Din `Attar wrote: &ldquo;Be occupied as little as
  possible with things of the outer world but much with things of
  the inner world; then right action will overcome
  inaction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If Emacs could become a more intelligent data store, where
  brainstorming would focus on the <em>ideas</em>
  involved&mdash;rather than the structuring and format of those
  ideas, or having to stop your current flow of work in order to
  record them&mdash;it would map much more closely to how the mind
  (well, at least mine) works, and hence would eliminate that very
  manual-ness which computers from the very beginning have been
  championed as being able to reduce.</p>
