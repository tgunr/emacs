  <h3 class="section">1.6 Menus and the <kbd>m</kbd> command</h3>

  <p><a name="index-menus-in-an-Info-document-23" id=
  "index-menus-in-an-Info-document-23"></a><a name=
  "index-Info-menus-24" id="index-Info-menus-24"></a> With only the
  <kbd>n</kbd> (next), <kbd>p</kbd> (previous),
  <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;</kbd>,
  <kbd>]</kbd> and <kbd>[</kbd> commands for moving between nodes,
  nodes are restricted to a linear sequence. Menus allow a
  branching structure. A menu is a list of other nodes you can move
  to. It is actually just part of the text of the node formatted
  specially so that Info can interpret it. The beginning of a menu
  is always identified by a line which starts with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*&nbsp;Menu:</span></samp>&rsquo;
  <!-- /@w -->. A node contains a menu if and only if it has a line
  in it which starts that way. The only menu you can use at any
  moment is the one in the node you are in. To use a menu in any
  other node, you must move to that node first.</p>

  <p>After the start of the menu, each line that starts with a
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; identifies
  one subtopic. The line usually contains a brief name for the
  subtopic (followed by a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;, normally hidden in Emacs), the
  name of the node that talks about that subtopic (again, normally
  hidden in Emacs), and optionally some further description of the
  subtopic. Lines in the menu that do not start with a
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; have no
  special meaning&mdash;they are only for the human reader's
  benefit and do not define additional subtopics. Here is an
  example:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     * Foo:  Node about FOO.      This tells about FOO.
</pre>

  <p>The subtopic name is Foo, and the node describing it is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Node about
  FOO</span></samp>&rsquo;. The rest of the line is just for the
  reader's Information. [[ But this line is not a real menu item,
  simply because there is no line above it which starts with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*&nbsp;Menu:</span></samp>&rsquo;
  <!-- /@w -->. Also, in a real menu item, the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; would
  appear at the very start of the line. This is why the
  &ldquo;normally hidden&rdquo; text in Emacs, namely
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">: Node about
  FOO.</span></samp>&rsquo;, is actually visible in this example,
  even when Visible mode is off.]]</p>

  <p>When you use a menu to go to another node (in a way that will
  be described soon), what you specify is the subtopic name, the
  first thing in the menu line. Info uses it to find the menu line,
  extracts the node name from it, and goes to that node. The reason
  that there is both a subtopic name and a node name is that the
  node name must be meaningful to the computer and may therefore
  have to be ugly looking. The subtopic name can be chosen just to
  be convenient for the user to specify. Often the node name is
  convenient for the user to specify and so both it and the
  subtopic name are the same. There is an abbreviation for
  this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     * Foo::   This tells about FOO.
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">This means that the subtopic name and node
  name are the same; they are both &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Foo</span></samp>&rsquo;. (The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; is normally hidden in Emacs.)</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Now use &lt;SPC&gt; to find the menu in this node, then come back to
   the front with a <kbd>b</kbd> and some &lt;SPC&gt;s.  As you see, a menu is
   actually visible in its node.  If you cannot find a menu in a node
   by looking at it, then the node does not have a menu and the
   <kbd>m</kbd> command is not available.
</pre>

  <p>If you keep typing &lt;SPC&gt; once the menu appears on the
  screen, it will move to another node (the first one in the menu).
  If that happens, type &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; to come back.</p>

  <p><a name="index-m-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-25" id=
  "index-m-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-25"></a> The command
  to go to one of the subnodes is <kbd>m</kbd>. This is very
  different from the commands you have used: it is a command that
  prompts you for more input.</p>

  <p>The Info commands you know do not need additional input; when
  you type one of them, Info processes it instantly and then is
  ready for another command. The <kbd>m</kbd> command is different:
  it needs to know the <dfn>name of the subtopic</dfn>. Once you
  have typed <kbd>m</kbd>, Info tries to read the subtopic
  name.</p>

  <p>Now, in the stand-alone Info, look for the line containing
  many dashes near the bottom of the screen. (This is the
  stand-alone equivalent for the mode line in Emacs.) There is one
  more line beneath that one, but usually it is blank. (In Emacs,
  this is the echo area.) When it is blank, Info is ready for a
  command, such as <kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>b</kbd> or &lt;SPC&gt; or
  <kbd>m</kbd>. If that line contains text ending in a colon, it
  means Info is reading more input for the last command. You can't
  type an Info command then, because Info is trying to read input,
  not commands. You must either give the input and finish the
  command you started, or type <kbd>Control-g</kbd> to cancel the
  command. When you have done one of those things, the input entry
  line becomes blank again. Then you can type Info commands
  again.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Info_002dmenu-26" id=
  "index-Info_002dmenu-26"></a> The command to go to a subnode via
  a menu is <kbd>m</kbd>. After you type the <kbd>m</kbd>, the line
  at the bottom of the screen says &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Menu item:</span></samp> &rsquo;. You must then type the
  name of the subtopic you want, and end it with a &lt;RET&gt;.</p>

  <p><a name="index-abbreviating-Info-subnodes-27" id=
  "index-abbreviating-Info-subnodes-27"></a> You can abbreviate the
  subtopic name. If the abbreviation is not unique, the first
  matching subtopic is chosen. Some menus put the shortest possible
  abbreviation for each subtopic name in capital letters, so you
  can see how much you need to type. It does not matter whether you
  use upper case or lower case when you type the subtopic. You
  should not put any spaces at the end, or inside of the item name,
  except for one space where a space appears in the item in the
  menu.</p>

  <p><a name="index-completion-of-Info-node-names-28" id=
  "index-completion-of-Info-node-names-28"></a> You can also use
  the <dfn>completion</dfn> feature to help enter the subtopic
  name. If you type the &lt;TAB&gt; key after entering part of a
  name, it will fill in more of the name&mdash;as much as Info can
  deduce from the part you have entered.</p>

  <p>If you move the cursor to one of the menu subtopic lines, then
  you do not need to type the argument: you just type a
  &lt;RET&gt;, and it stands for the subtopic of the line you are
  on. You can also click the middle mouse button directly on the
  subtopic line to go there.</p>

  <p>Here is a menu to give you a chance to practice. This menu
  gives you three ways of going to one place, Help-FOO:</p>

  <ul class="menu">
    <li><a accesskey="1" href=
    "Help_002dFOO.html#Help_002dFOO">Foo</a>: A node you can visit
    for fun.</li>

    <li><a accesskey="2" href=
    "Help_002dFOO.html#Help_002dFOO">Bar</a>: We have made two ways
    to get to the same place.</li>

    <li><a accesskey="3" href=
    "Help_002dFOO.html#Help_002dFOO">Help-FOO</a>: And yet
    another!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(Turn Visible mode on if you are using Emacs.)</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt;  Now type just an <kbd>m</kbd> and see what happens:
</pre>

  <p>Now you are &ldquo;inside&rdquo; an <kbd>m</kbd> command.
  Commands cannot be used now; the next thing you will type must be
  the name of a subtopic.</p>

  <p>You can change your mind about doing the <kbd>m</kbd> by
  typing <kbd>Control-g</kbd>.</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Try that now;  notice the bottom line clear.
</pre>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Then type another <kbd>m</kbd>.
</pre>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>BAR</kbd>, the item name.  Do not type &lt;RET&gt; yet.
</pre>

  <p>While you are typing the item name, you can use the
  &lt;DEL&gt; (or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;) key to cancel one character at
  a time if you make a mistake.</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Press &lt;DEL&gt; to cancel the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
"samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You could type another <kbd>R</kbd>
   to replace it.  But you do not have to, since &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BA</span></samp>&rsquo; is a valid
   abbreviation.
</pre>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Now you are ready to go.  Type a &lt;RET&gt;.
</pre>

  <p>After visiting &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Help-FOO</span></samp>&rsquo;, you should return here.</p>

  <p>Another way to move to the menu subtopic lines and between
  them is to type &lt;TAB&gt;. Each time you type a &lt;TAB&gt;,
  you move to the next subtopic line. To move to a previous
  subtopic line in the stand-alone reader, type
  <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>&mdash;that is, press and hold the
  &lt;META&gt; key and then press &lt;TAB&gt;. (On some keyboards,
  the &lt;META&gt; key might be labeled &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Alt</span></samp>&rsquo;.) In Emacs Info, type
  <kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to move to a previous subtopic line
  (press and hold the &lt;Shift&gt; key and then press
  &lt;TAB&gt;).</p>

  <p>Once you move cursor to a subtopic line, press &lt;RET&gt; to
  go to that subtopic's node.</p>

  <p><a name="index-mouse-support-in-Info-mode-29" id=
  "index-mouse-support-in-Info-mode-29"></a><a name=
  "index-Mouse_002d2-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-30" id=
  "index-Mouse_002d2-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-30"></a>
  If your terminal supports a mouse, you have yet another way of
  going to a subtopic. Move your mouse pointer to the subtopic
  line, somewhere between the beginning &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; and the colon
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; which ends
  the subtopic's brief name. You will see the subtopic's name
  change its appearance (usually, its background color will
  change), and the shape of the mouse pointer will change if your
  platform supports that. After a while, if you leave the mouse on
  that spot, a small window will pop up, saying &ldquo;Mouse-2: go
  to that node,&rdquo; or the same message may appear at the bottom
  of the screen.</p>

  <p><kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> is the second button of your mouse counting
  from the left&mdash;the middle button on a 3-button mouse. (On a
  2-button mouse, you may have to press both buttons together to
  &ldquo;press the middle button&rdquo;.) The message tells you
  pressing <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> with the current position of the
  mouse pointer (on subtopic in the menu) will go to that
  subtopic.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-Info_002dmouse_002dfollow_002dnearest_002dnode-31" id=
  "index-Info_002dmouse_002dfollow_002dnearest_002dnode-31"></a>
  More generally, <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> in an Info buffer finds the
  nearest link to another node and goes there. For example, near a
  cross reference it acts like <kbd>f</kbd>, in a menu it acts like
  <kbd>m</kbd>, on the node's header line it acts like
  <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>p</kbd>, or <kbd>u</kbd>, etc. At end of the
  node's text <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> moves to the next node, or up if
  there's no next node.</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>n</kbd> to see more commands.
