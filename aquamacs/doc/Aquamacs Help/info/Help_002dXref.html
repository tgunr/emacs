  <h3 class="section">1.7 Following Cross-References</h3>

  <p><a name="index-cross-references-in-Info-documents-34" id=
  "index-cross-references-in-Info-documents-34"></a> In Info
  documentation, you will see many <dfn>cross references</dfn>.
  Cross references look like this: See <a href=
  "Help_002dCross.html#Help_002dCross">Cross</a>. That text is a
  real, live cross reference, whose name is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Cross</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  which points to the node named &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Help-Cross</span></samp>&rsquo;. (The node name is hidden
  in Emacs. Do <kbd>M-x visible-mode</kbd> to show or hide it.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-f-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-35" id=
  "index-f-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-35"></a><a name=
  "index-Info_002dfollow_002dreference-36" id=
  "index-Info_002dfollow_002dreference-36"></a> You can follow a
  cross reference by moving the cursor to it and press &lt;RET&gt;,
  just as in a menu. In Emacs, you can also click
  <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> on a cross reference to follow it; you can see
  that the cross reference is mouse-sensitive by moving the mouse
  pointer to the reference and watching how the underlying text and
  the mouse pointer change in response.</p>

  <p>Another way to follow a cross reference is to type
  <kbd>f</kbd> and then specify the name of the cross reference (in
  this case, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Cross</span></samp>&rsquo;) as an argument. For this
  command, it does not matter where the cursor was. If the cursor
  is on or near a cross reference, <kbd>f</kbd> suggests that
  reference name in parentheses as the default; typing &lt;RET&gt;
  will follow that reference. However, if you type a different
  reference name, <kbd>f</kbd> will follow the other reference
  which has that name.</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>f</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Cross</kbd>, and then &lt;RET&gt;.
</pre>

  <p>As you enter the reference name, you can use the &lt;DEL&gt;
  (or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;) key to edit your input. If you change your
  mind about following any reference, you can use
  <kbd>Control-g</kbd> to cancel the command. Completion is
  available in the <kbd>f</kbd> command; you can complete among all
  the cross reference names in the current node by typing a
  &lt;TAB&gt;.</p>

  <p>To get a list of all the cross references in the current node,
  you can type <kbd>?</kbd> after an <kbd>f</kbd>. The <kbd>f</kbd>
  continues to await a cross reference name even after displaying
  the list, so if you don't actually want to follow a reference,
  you should type a <kbd>Control-g</kbd> to cancel the
  <kbd>f</kbd>.</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>f?</kbd> to get a list of the cross references in this node.  Then
   type a <kbd>Control-g</kbd> and see how the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; gives up.
</pre>

  <p>The &lt;TAB&gt;, <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> and
  <kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> keys, which move between menu items in a
  menu, also move between cross references outside of menus.</p>

  <p>Sometimes a cross reference (or a node) can lead to another
  file (in other words another &ldquo;manual&rdquo;), or, on
  occasion, even a file on a remote machine (although Info files
  distributed with Emacs or the stand-alone Info avoid using remote
  links). Such a cross reference looks like this: See <a href=
  "../texinfo/index.html#Top">Overview of Texinfo</a>. (After
  following this link, type <kbd>l</kbd> to get back to this node.)
  Here the name &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">texinfo</span></samp>&rsquo; between parentheses refers to
  the file name. This file name appears in cross references and
  node names if it differs from the current file, so you can always
  know that you are going to be switching to another manual and
  which one.</p>

  <p>However, Emacs normally hides some other text in
  cross-references. If you put your mouse over the cross reference,
  then the information appearing in a separate box (tool tip) or in
  the echo area will show the full cross-reference including the
  file name and the node name of the cross reference. If you have a
  mouse, just leave it over the cross reference See <a href=
  "../texinfo/index.html#Top">Overview of Texinfo</a>, and watch
  what happens. If you always like to have that information visible
  without having to move your mouse over the cross reference, use
  <kbd>M-x visible-mode</kbd>, or set
  <code>Info-hide-note-references</code> to a value other than
  <code>t</code> (see <a href=
  "Emacs-Info-Variables.html#Emacs-Info-Variables">Emacs Info
  Variables</a>).</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>n</kbd> to learn more commands.
