  <h3 class="section">3.2 How to Create Menus</h3>

  <p>Any node in the Info hierarchy may have a
  <dfn>menu</dfn>&mdash;a list of subnodes. The <kbd>m</kbd>
  command searches the current node's menu for the topic which it
  reads from the terminal.</p>

  <p><a name="index-menu-and-menu-entry-format-96" id=
  "index-menu-and-menu-entry-format-96"></a> A menu begins with a
  line starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*&nbsp;Menu:</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->. The rest of
  the line is a comment. After the starting line, every line that
  begins with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>
  &rsquo; lists a single topic. The name of the topic&mdash;what
  the user must type at the <kbd>m</kbd>'s command prompt to select
  this topic&mdash;comes right after the star and space, and is
  followed by a colon, spaces and tabs, and the name of the node
  which discusses that topic. The node name, like node names
  following &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Previous</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>&rsquo;, may be
  terminated with a tab, comma, or newline; it may also be
  terminated with a period.</p>

  <p>If the node name and topic name are the same, then rather than
  giving the name twice, the abbreviation &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span> <var>name</var><span class=
  "samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; may be used (and should be used,
  whenever possible, as it reduces the visual clutter in the
  menu).</p>

  <p>It is considerate to choose the topic names so that they
  differ from each other very near the beginning&mdash;this allows
  the user to type short abbreviations. In a long menu, it is a
  good idea to capitalize the beginning of each item name which is
  the minimum acceptable abbreviation for it (a long menu is more
  than 5 or so entries).</p>

  <p>The nodes listed in a node's menu are called its
  &ldquo;subnodes,&rdquo; and it is their &ldquo;superior&rdquo;.
  They should each have an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Up:</span></samp>&rsquo; pointing at the superior. It is
  often useful to arrange all or most of the subnodes in a sequence
  of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>&rsquo;
  pointers so that someone who wants to see them all need not keep
  revisiting the Menu.</p>

  <p>The Info Directory is simply the menu of the node
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(dir)Top</span></samp>&rsquo;&mdash;that is, node
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo; in file
  <samp><span class="file">.../info/dir</span></samp>. You can put
  new entries in that menu just like any other menu. The Info
  Directory is <em>not</em> the same as the file directory called
  <samp><span class="file">info</span></samp>. It happens that many
  of Info's files live in that file directory, but they do not have
  to; and files in that directory are not automatically listed in
  the Info Directory node.</p>

  <p>Also, although the Info node graph is claimed to be a
  &ldquo;hierarchy,&rdquo; in fact it can be <em>any</em> directed
  graph. Shared structures and pointer cycles are perfectly
  possible, and can be used if they are appropriate to the meaning
  to be expressed. There is no need for all the nodes in a file to
  form a connected structure. In fact, this file has two connected
  components. You are in one of them, which is under the node
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo;; the
  other contains the node &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Help</span></samp>&rsquo; which the <kbd>h</kbd> command
  goes to. In fact, since there is no garbage collector on the node
  graph, nothing terrible happens if a substructure is not pointed
  to, but such a substructure is rather useless since nobody can
  ever find out that it exists.</p>
