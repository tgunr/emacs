  <h3 class="section">2.2 <kbd>i</kbd> searches the indices for
  specific subjects</h3>

  <p><a name="index-searching-Info-indices-63" id=
  "index-searching-Info-indices-63"></a><a name=
  "index-i-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-64" id=
  "index-i-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-64"></a><a name=
  "index-Info_002dindex-65" id="index-Info_002dindex-65"></a> Since
  most topics in the manual should be indexed, you should try the
  index search first before the text search. The <kbd>i</kbd>
  command prompts you for a subject and then looks up that subject
  in the indices. If it finds an index entry with the subject you
  typed, it goes to the node to which that index entry points. You
  should browse through that node to see whether the issue you are
  looking for is described there. If it isn't, type <kbd>,</kbd>
  one or more times to go through additional index entries which
  match your subject.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>i</kbd> command and subsequent <kbd>,</kbd> commands
  find all index entries which include the string you typed <em>as
  a substring</em>. For each match, Info shows in the echo area the
  full index entry it found. Often, the text of the full index
  entry already gives you enough information to decide whether it
  is relevant to what you are looking for, so we recommend that you
  read what Info shows in the echo area before looking at the node
  it displays.</p>

  <p>Since <kbd>i</kbd> looks for a substring, you can search for
  subjects even if you are not sure how they are spelled in the
  index. For example, suppose you want to find something that is
  pertinent to commands which complete partial input (e.g., when
  you type &lt;TAB&gt;). If you want to catch index entries that
  refer to &ldquo;complete,&rdquo; &ldquo;completion,&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;completing,&rdquo; you could type
  <kbd>icomplet&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Info documents which describe programs should index the
  commands, options, and key sequences that the program provides.
  If you are looking for a description of a command, an option, or
  a key, just type their names when <kbd>i</kbd> prompts you for a
  topic. For example, if you want to read the description of what
  the <kbd>C-l</kbd> key does, type <kbd>iC-l&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
  literally.</p>

  "index-Info_002dvirtual_002dindex-66"></a><a name=
  "index-I-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-67" id=
  "index-I-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-67"></a>Emacs
  provides the command <code>Info-virtual-index</code>, bound to
  the <kbd>I</kbd> key. This behaves like <kbd>i</kbd>, but
  constructs a virtual info node displaying the results of an index
  search, making it easier to select the one you want.</p>

  <p><a name="index-info_002dapropos-68" id=
  "index-info_002dapropos-68"></a><a name=
  "index-index_002dapropos-69" id=
  "index-index_002dapropos-69"></a>If you aren't sure which manual
  documents the topic you are looking for, try the <kbd>M-x
  info-apropos</kbd> command in Emacs, or the <kbd>M-x
  index-apropos</kbd> command in the stand-alone reader. It prompts
  for a string and then looks up that string in all the indices of
  all the Info documents installed on your system.</p>
