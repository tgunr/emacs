  <h3 class="section">1.4 The Space, DEL, B and ^L commands</h3>

  <p>This node's mode line tells you that you are now at node
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Help-^L</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  the header line tells you that <kbd>p</kbd> would get you back to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Help-P</span></samp>&rsquo;. The
  node's title is highlighted and may be underlined as well; it
  says what the node is about.</p>

  <p>This is a big node and it does not all fit on your display
  screen. You can tell that there is more that is not visible
  because you can see the text &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">All</span></samp>&rsquo; near the
  bottom of the screen.</p>

  <p><a name="index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-8" id=
  "index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-8"></a><a name=

  "index-Info_002dscroll_002ddown-12" id=
  "index-Info_002dscroll_002ddown-12"></a> The &lt;SPC&gt;,
  &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; (or &lt;DEL&gt;)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1"
  name="fnd-1" id="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and <kbd>b</kbd>
  commands exist to allow you to &ldquo;move around&rdquo; in a
  node that does not all fit on the screen at once. &lt;SPC&gt;
  moves forward, to show what was below the bottom of the screen.
  &lt;DEL&gt; or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; moves backward, to show what was
  above the top of the screen (there is not anything above the top
  until you have typed some spaces).</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Now try typing a &lt;SPC&gt; (afterward, type a &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; to
   return here).
</pre>

  <p>When you type the &lt;SPC&gt;, the two lines that were at the
  bottom of the screen appear at the top, followed by more lines.
  &lt;DEL&gt; or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; takes the two lines from the top
  and moves them to the bottom, <em>usually</em>, but if there are
  not a full screen's worth of lines above them they may not make
  it all the way to the bottom.</p>

  <p>If you are reading this in Emacs, note that the header line is
  always visible, never scrolling off the display. That way, you
  can always see the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Prev</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Up</span></samp>&rsquo; links, and you can conveniently go
  to one of these links at any time by clicking the middle mouse
  button on the link.</p>

  <p><a name="index-reading-Info-documents-top-to-bottom-13" id=
  "index-reading-Info-documents-top-to-bottom-13"></a><a name=
  "index-Info-documents-as-tutorials-14" id=
  "index-Info-documents-as-tutorials-14"></a> &lt;SPC&gt; and
  &lt;DEL&gt; not only move forward and backward through the
  current node. They also move between nodes. &lt;SPC&gt; at the
  end of a node moves to the next node; &lt;DEL&gt; (or
  &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;) at the beginning of a node moves to the
  previous node. In effect, these commands scroll through all the
  nodes in an Info file as a single logical sequence. You can read
  an entire manual top to bottom by just typing &lt;SPC&gt;, and
  move backward through the entire manual from bottom to top by
  typing &lt;DEL&gt; (or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;).</p>

  <p>In this sequence, a node's subnodes appear following their
  parent. If a node has a menu, &lt;SPC&gt; takes you into the
  subnodes listed in the menu, one by one. Once you reach the end
  of a node, and have seen all of its subnodes, &lt;SPC&gt; takes
  you to the next node or to the parent's next node.</p>

  <p><a name="index-PAGEUP-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-15"
  id=
  "index-PAGEUP-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-15"></a><a name="index-PAGEDOWN-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-16"
  id="index-PAGEDOWN-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-16"></a>
  Many keyboards nowadays have two scroll keys labeled
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PageUp</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PageDown</span></samp>&rsquo; (or
  maybe &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Prior</span></samp>&rsquo;
  and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo;).
  If your keyboard has these keys, you can use them to move forward
  and backward through the text of one node, like &lt;SPC&gt; and
  &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; (or &lt;DEL&gt;). However, &lt;PAGEUP&gt; and
  &lt;PAGEDOWN&gt; keys never scroll beyond the beginning or the
  end of the current node.</p>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dl-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-17"
  id="index-C_002dl-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-17"></a> If
  your screen is ever garbaged, you can tell Info to display it
  again by typing <kbd>C-l</kbd> (<kbd>Control-L</kbd>&mdash;that
  is, hold down &lt;CTRL&gt; and type <kbd>L</kbd> or
  <kbd>l</kbd>).</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>C-l</kbd> now.
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-b-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-18" id=
  "index-b-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-18"></a> To move
  back to the beginning of the node you are on, you can type the
  &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; key (or &lt;DEL&gt;) many times. You can also
  type <kbd>b</kbd> just once. <kbd>b</kbd> stands for
  &ldquo;beginning.&rdquo;</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Try that now.  (We have put in enough verbiage to push this past
   the first screenful, but screens are so big nowadays that perhaps it
   isn't enough.  You may need to shrink your Emacs or Info window.)
   Then come back, by typing &lt;SPC&gt; one or more times.
</pre>

  <p><a name=
  "index-g_t_003f-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-19" id=
  "index-g_t_003f-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-19"></a><a name="index-Info_002dsummary-20"
  id="index-Info_002dsummary-20"></a> You have just learned a
  considerable number of commands. If you want to use one but have
  trouble remembering which, you should type <kbd>?</kbd>, which
  displays a brief list of commands. When you are finished looking
  at the list, make it go away by typing &lt;SPC&gt;
  repeatedly.</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Type a &lt;?&gt; now.  Press &lt;SPC&gt; to see consecutive screenfuls of
   the list until finished.  Then type &lt;SPC&gt; several times.  If
   you are using Emacs, the help will then go away automatically.
</pre>

  <p>(If you are using the stand-alone Info reader, type <kbd>C-x
  0</kbd> to return here, that is&mdash;press and hold
  &lt;CTRL&gt;, type an <kbd>x</kbd>, then release &lt;CTRL&gt; and
  <kbd>x</kbd>, and press <kbd>0</kbd>; that's a zero, not the
  letter &ldquo;o&rdquo;.)</p>

  <p>From now on, you will encounter large nodes without warning,
  and will be expected to know how to use &lt;SPC&gt; and
  &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; to move around in them without being told.
  Since not all terminals have the same size screen, it would be
  impossible to warn you anyway.</p>
  <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>n</kbd>, or click the middle mouse button on the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo; link,
   to visit the next node.
</pre>

    <h4>Footnotes</h4>

    <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1" id=
    "fn-1">1</a>]</small> The key which we call &ldquo;Backspace or
    DEL&rdquo; in this manual is labeled differently on different
    keyboards. Look for a key which is a little ways above the
    &lt;ENTER&gt; or &lt;RET&gt; key and which you normally use
    outside Emacs to erase the character before the cursor, i.e.
    the character you typed last. It might be labeled
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backspace</span></samp>&rsquo;
    or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;-</span></samp>&rsquo;
    or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DEL</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
