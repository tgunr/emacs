  <h3 class="section">3.3 Viper Specials</h3>

  <p>Viper extends Vi with a number of useful features. This
  includes various search functions, histories of search strings,
  Ex commands, insertions, and Vi's destructive commands. In
  addition, Viper supports file name completion and history,
  completion of Ex commands and variables, and many other features.
  Some of these features are explained in detail elsewhere in this
  document. Other features are explained here.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>(viper-buffer-search-enable)</code><br /></dt>

    <dt><code>viper-buffer-search-char nil</code></dt>

    <dd>Enable buffer search. Explicit call to
    <code>viper-buffer-search-enable</code> sets
    <code>viper-buffer-search-char</code> to <kbd>g</kbd>.
    Alternatively, the user can set
    <code>viper-buffer-search-char</code> in <samp><span class=
    "file">.viper</span></samp> to a key sequence to be used for
    buffer search. There is no need to call
    <code>viper-buffer-search-enable</code> in that case. <a name=
    "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dbuffer_002dsearch_002denable_007d-245"
    id=
    "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dbuffer_002dsearch_002denable_007d-245">
    </a><a name=
    "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dbuffer_002dsearch_002dchar_007d-246"
    id=
    "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dbuffer_002dsearch_002dchar_007d-246"></a><br />
    </dd>

    <dt><code>viper-toggle-search-style</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function, bound to <kbd>C-c /</kbd>, lets one toggle
      case-sensitive and case-insensitive search, and also switch
      between plain vanilla search and search via regular
      expressions. Without the prefix argument, the user is asked
      which mode to toggle. With prefix argument 1, this toggles
      case-sensitivity. With prefix argument 2, regular
      expression/vanilla search will be toggled.

      <p>However, we found that the most convenient way to toggle
      these options is to bind a Vi macro to bind <kbd>//</kbd> to
      toggles case sensitivity and to <kbd>///</kbd> to toggles
      vanilla search. Thus, quickly hitting <kbd>/</kbd> twice will
      switch Viper from case sensitive search to case-insensitive.
      Repeating this once again will restore the original state.
      Likewise, quickly hitting <kbd>/</kbd> three times will
      switch you from vanilla-style search to search via regular
      expressions. If you hit something other than <kbd>/</kbd>
      after the first <kbd>/</kbd> or if the second <kbd>/</kbd>
      doesn't follow quickly enough, then Viper will issue the
      usual prompt <kbd>/</kbd> and will wait for input, as usual
      in Vi. If you don't like this behavior, you can
      &ldquo;unrecord&rdquo; these macros in your
      <samp><span class="file">~/.viper</span></samp> file. For
      instance, if you don't like the above feature, put this in
      <samp><span class="file">~/.viper</span></samp>:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (viper-set-searchstyle-toggling-macros 'undefine)
</pre>

      <p><a name=
      "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dset_002dsearchstyle_002dtoggling_002dmacros_007d-247"

      </a> If you don't like this feature as a default, but would
      still like to have it in some major modes, you can do so by
      first unsetting it globally, as shown above, and then setting
      it in the desired major modes as follows:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (viper-set-searchstyle-toggling-macros nil 'c-mode)
          (viper-set-searchstyle-toggling-macros nil 'lisp-mode)
</pre><br />
    </dd>

    <dt><code>Vi-isms in Emacs state</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Some people find it useful to use the Vi-style search key,
      `/', to invoke search in modes which Viper leaves in
      emacs-state. These modes are: <code>dired-mode</code>,
      <code>mh-folder-mode</code>, <code>Info-mode</code>, and
      <code>Buffer-menu-mode</code> (more may be added in the
      future). So, in the above modes, Viper binds `/' so that it
      will behave Vi-style. Furthermore, in those major modes,
      Viper binds `:' to invoke ex-style commands, like in
      vi-state. And, as described above, `//' and `///' get bound
      to Vi-style macros that toggle case-insensitivity and
      regexp-search.

      <p>If you don't like these features&mdash;which I don't
      really understand&mdash;you can unbind `/' and `:' in
      <code>viper-dired-modifier-map</code> (for Dired) or in
      <code>viper-slash-and-colon-map</code>, for other modes.
      <a name=
      "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dslash_002dand_002dcolon_002dmap_007d-248"
      id=

      id=
      "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002ddired_002dmodifier_002dmap_007d-249"></a>
      To unbind the macros `//' and `///' for a major mode where
      you feel they are undesirable, execute
      <code>viper-set-emacs-state-searchstyle-macros</code> with a
      non-<code>nil</code> argument. This can be done either
      interactively, by supplying a prefix argument, or by
      placing</p>

      </a>Viper supports Emacs-style file completion when it
      prompts the user for a file name. However, in many cases, the
      same directory may contain files with identical prefix but
      different suffixes, e.g., prog.c, prog.o, paper.tex,
      paper.dvi. In such cases, completion will stop at the `.'. If
      the above variable is a list of strings representing
      suffixes, Viper will try these suffixes in the order listed
      and will check if the corresponding file exists.

      <p>For instance, if completion stopped at `paper.' and the
      user typed &lt;RET&gt;, then Viper will check if the files
      `paper.', `paper.tex', `paper.c', etc., exist. It will take
      the first such file. If no file exists, Viper will give a
      chance to complete the file name by typing the appropriate
      suffix. If `paper.' was the intended file name, hitting
      return will accept it.</p>

      </a><a name="index-Insertion-ring-258" id=
      "index-Insertion-ring-258"></a>Viper remembers what was
      previously inserted in Insert and Replace states. Several
      such recent insertions are kept in a special ring of strings
      of size <code>viper-insertion-ring-size</code>. If you enter
      Insert or Replace state you can reinsert strings from this
      ring by typing <kbd>C-c M-p</kbd> or <kbd>C-c M-n</kbd>. The
      former will search the ring in the direction of older
      insertions, and the latter will search in the direction of
      newer insertions. Hitting <kbd>C-c M-p</kbd> or <kbd>C-c
      M-n</kbd> in succession will undo the previous insertion from
      the ring and insert the next item on the ring. If a larger
      ring size is needed, change the value of the above variable
      in the <samp><span class="file">~/.viper</span></samp> file.

      <p>Since typing these sequences of keys may be tedious, it is
      suggested that the user should bind a function key, such as
      <kbd>f31</kbd>, as follows:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (define-key viper-insert-global-user-map [f31]
                      'viper-insert-prev-from-insertion-ring)
</pre>

      <p>This binds <kbd>f31</kbd> (which is usually <kbd>R11</kbd>
      on a Sun workstation) to the function that inserts the
      previous string in the insertion history. To rotate the
      history in the opposite direction, you can either bind an
      unused key to
      <code>viper-insert-next-from-insertion-ring</code> or hit any
      digit (1 to 9) then <kbd>f31</kbd>.</p>

      <p>One should not bind the above functions to <kbd>M-p</kbd>
      or <kbd>M-n</kbd>, since this will interfere with the
      minibuffer histories and, possibly, other major
      modes.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>viper-command-ring-size 14</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name=
      "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dcommand_002dring_002dsize_007d-259"
      id=

      "index-Destructive-command-history-261" id=
      "index-Destructive-command-history-261"></a>Viper keeps track
      of the recent history of destructive commands, such as
      <kbd>dw</kbd>, <kbd>i</kbd>, etc. In Vi state, the most
      recent command can be re-executed by hitting `<kbd>.</kbd>',
      as in Vi. However, repeated typing <kbd>C-c M-p</kbd> will
      cause Viper to show the previous destructive commands in the
      minibuffer. Subsequent hitting `<kbd>.</kbd>' will execute
      the command that was displayed last. The key <kbd>C-c
      M-n</kbd> will cycle through the command history in the
      opposite direction. Since typing <kbd>C-c M-p</kbd> may be
      tedious, it is more convenient to bind an appropriate
      function to an unused function key on the keyboard and use
      that key. For instance, the following
      <pre class="example">
          (define-key viper-vi-global-user-map [f31]
                      'viper-prev-destructive-command)
</pre>

      <p>binds the key <kbd>f31</kbd> (which is usually
      <kbd>R11</kbd> on a Sun workstation) to the function that
      searches the command history in the direction of older
      commands. To search in the opposite direction, you can either
      bind an unused key to
      <code>viper-next-destructive-command</code> or hit any digit
      (1 to 9) then <kbd>f31</kbd>.</p>

      <p>One should not bind the above functions to <kbd>M-p</kbd>
      or <kbd>M-n</kbd>, since this will interfere with the
      minibuffer histories and, possibly, other major
      modes.<br /></p>

      These faces control the appearance of the minibuffer text in
      the corresponding Viper states. You can change the appearance
      of these faces through Emacs' customization widget, which is
      accessible through the menubar.

      <p>Viper is located in this widget under the
      <em>Emulations</em> customization subgroup of the
      <em>Editing</em> group. All Viper faces are grouped together
      in Viper's <em>Highlighting</em> customization subgroup.</p>

      <p>Note that only the text you type in is affected by the
      above faces. Prompts and minibuffer messages are not
      affected.</p>

      <p>Purists who do not like adornments in the minibuffer can
      always zap them by putting</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (copy-face 'default 'viper-minibuffer-vi-face)
          (copy-face 'default 'viper-minibuffer-insert-face)

</pre>

      <p>in the <samp><span class="file">~/.viper</span></samp>
      file or through the customization widget, as described above.
      However, in that case, the user will not have any indication
      of the current Viper state in the minibuffer. (This is
      important if the user accidentally switches to another Viper
      state by typing &lt;ESC&gt; or <kbd>C-z</kbd>).<br /></p>

  <p><a name="index-Multifile-documents-and-programs-264" id=
  "index-Multifile-documents-and-programs-264"></a> Viper provides
  some support for multi-file documents and programs. If a document
  consists of several files we can designate one of them as a
  master and put the following at the end of that file:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     ;; Local Variables:
     ;; eval: (viper-setup-master-buffer "file1" "file2" "file3" "file4")
     ;; End:
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">where <code>file1</code> to
  <code>file4</code> are names of files related to the master file.
  Next time, when the master file is visited, the command
  <code>viper-setup-master-buffer</code> will be evaluated and the
  above files will be associated with the master file. Then, the
  new Ex command <kbd>:RelatedFile</kbd> (abbr. <kbd>:R</kbd>) will
  display files 1 to 4 one after another, so you can edit them. If
  a file is not in any Emacs buffer, it will be visited. The
  command <kbd>PreviousRelatedFile</kbd> (abbr., <kbd>:P</kbd>)
  goes through the file list in the opposite direction. <a name=
  "index-g_t_0040kbd_007b_003aRelatedFile_007d-265" id=

  "index-g_t_0040kbd_007b_003aPreviousRelatedFile_007d-266"></a>
  These commands are akin to <kbd>:n</kbd> and <kbd>:N</kbd>, but
  they allow the user to focus on relevant files only.</p>

  <p>Note that only the master file needs to have the
  aforementioned block of commands. Also, ";;" above can be
  replaced by some other markers. Semicolon is good for Lisp
  programs, since it is considered a comment designator there. For
  LaTeX, this could be "%%%", and for C the above block should be
  commented out.</p>

  <p>Even though these commands are sometimes useful, they are no
  substitute for the powerful <em>tag table</em> facility of Emacs.
  Viper's <kbd>:tag</kbd> command in a primitive interface to Emacs
  tags. See <a href="../emacs/Tags.html#Tags">Tags</a>, for more
  information on tags.</p>

  <p>The following two commands are normally bound to a mouse click
  and are part of Viper. They work only if Emacs runs as an
  application under X Windows (or under some other window system
  for which a port of GNU Emacs 20 is available). Clicking the
  mouse when Emacs is invoked in an Xterm window (using <code>emacs
  -nw</code>) will do no good. <a name="index-mouse-267" id=

      Shift keys while clicking mouse button 1 should initiate
      search for a region under the mouse pointer (defined below).
      This command can take a prefix argument, which indicates the
      occurrence of the pattern to search for.

      <p>Note: while loading initially, Viper binds this mouse
      action only if it is not already bound to something else. If
      you want to use the mouse-search feature, and the
      <kbd>Meta-Shift-Mouse-1</kbd> mouse action is already bound
      to something else, you can rebind the mouse-search feature by
      setting <code>viper-mouse-search-key</code> to something else
      in your <code>~/.viper</code> file:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (setq viper-mouse-search-key '(meta 1))
</pre>

      <p>This would bind mouse search to the action invoked by
      pressing the Meta key and clicking mouse button 1. The
      allowed values of <code>viper-mouse-search-key</code> are
      lists that contain a mouse-button number (1,2, or 3) and any
      combination of the words `control', `meta', and `shift'.</p>

      <p>If the requested mouse action (e.g., (meta 1)) is already
      taken for other purposes then you have to confirm your
      intention by placing the following command in
      <code>~/.viper</code> after setting
      <code>viper-mouse-search-key</code>:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (viper-bind-mouse-search-key 'force)
</pre>

      <p>You can also change this setting interactively, through
      the customization widget of Emacs (type
      <kbd>:customize</kbd>).</p>

      <p>The region that is chosen as a pattern to search for is
      determined as follows. If search is invoked via a single
      click, Viper chooses the region that lies between the
      beginning of the &ldquo;word&rdquo; under the pointer
      (&ldquo;word&rdquo; is understood in Vi sense) and the end of
      that word. The only difference with Vi's words is that in
      Lisp major modes `-' is considered an alphanumeric symbol.
      This is done for the convenience of working with Lisp
      symbols, which often have an `-' in them. Also, if you click
      on a non-alphanumeric character that is not a word separator
      (in Vi sense) then this character will also be considered
      alphanumeric, provided that it is adjacent (from either side)
      to an alphanumeric character. This useful feature gives added
      control over the patterns selected by the mouse click.</p>

      <p>On a double-click, the region is determined by the
      beginning of the current Vi's &ldquo;Word&rdquo; (i.e., the
      largest non-separator chunk of text) and the End of that
      &ldquo;Word&rdquo; (as determined by the <kbd>E</kbd>
      command).</p>

      <p>On a triple-click, the region consists of the entire line
      where the click occurred with all leading and trailing spaces
      and tabs removed.</p>

      </a>This variable controls the <em>mouse-insert</em> feature
      of Viper. The above default value states that holding Meta
      and Shift keys while clicking mouse button 2 should insert
      the region surrounding the mouse pointer. The rules defining
      this region are the same as for mouse-search. This command
      takes an optional prefix argument, which indicates how many
      such regions to snarf from the buffer and insert. (In case of
      a triple-click, the prefix argument is ignored.)

      <p>Note: while loading initially, Viper binds this mouse
      action only if it not already bound to something else. If you
      want to use this feature and the default mouse action is
      already bound, you can rebind mouse-insert by placing this
      command in <code>~/.viper</code>:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (setq viper-mouse-insert-key '(meta 2))
</pre>

      <p>If you want to bind mouse-insert to an action even if this
      action is already taken for other purposes in Emacs, then you
      should add this command to <code>~/.viper</code>, after
      setting <code>viper-mouse-insert-key</code>:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (viper-bind-mouse-insert-key 'force)
</pre>

      <p>This value can also be changed via the Emacs customization
      widget at the menubar.<br /></p>

    <dt><code>viper-multiclick-timeout</code></dt>

    <dd>This variable controls the rate at which double-clicking
    must occur for the purpose of mouse search and mouse insert. By
    default, this is set to <code>double-click-time</code> in Emacs
    and to <code>mouse-track-multi-click-time</code> milliseconds
    in XEmacs.</dd>

  Note: The above functions search and insert in the selected
  window of the latest active frame. This means that you can click
  in another window or another frame and have search or insertion
  done in the frame and window you just left. This lets one use
  these functions in a multi-frame configuration. However, this may
  require some getting used to. For instance, if you are typing in
  a frame, A, and then move the mouse to frame B and click to
  invoke mouse search, search (or insertion) will be performed in
  frame A. To perform search/insertion in frame B, you will first
  have to shift focus there, which doesn't happen until you type a
  character or perform some other action in frame B&mdash;mouse
  search doesn't shift focus.

  <p>If you decide that you don't like the above feature and always
  want search/insertion be performed in the frame where the click
  occurs, don't bind (and unbind, if necessary)
  <code>viper-mouse-catch-frame-switch</code> from the mouse event
  it is bound to.</p>

  <p>Mouse search is integrated with Vi-style search, so you can
  repeat it with <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>N</kbd>. It should be also
  noted that, while case-sensitivity of search in Viper is
  controlled by the variable <code>viper-case-fold-search</code>,
  the case of mouse search is controlled by the Emacs variable
  <code>case-fold-search</code>, which may be set differently from
  <code>viper-case-fold-search</code>. Therefore, case-sensitivity
  of mouse search may be different from that of the usual Vi-style
  search.</p>

  <p>Finally, if the way Viper determines the word to be searched
  for or to be inserted is not what you want, there is a variable,
  <code>viper-surrounding-word-function</code>, which can be
  changed to indicate another function for snarfing words out of
  the buffer. The catch is that you will then have to write such a
  function and make it known to your Emacs. The function
  <code>viper-surrounding-word</code> in <samp><span class=
  "file">viper.el</span></samp> can be used as a guiding
  example.</p>
