  Viper has four states, Emacs, Vi, Insert, and Replace.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Emacs
    state</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      This is the state plain vanilla Emacs is normally in. After
      you have loaded Viper, <kbd>C-z</kbd> will normally take you
      to Vi command state. Another <kbd>C-z</kbd> will take you
      back to Emacs state. This toggle key can be changed, see
      <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>
      You can also type <kbd>M-x viper-mode</kbd> to change to Vi
      state.

      <p>For users who chose to set their user level to 1 at Viper
      setup time, switching to Emacs state is deliberately made
      harder in order to not confuse the novice user. In this case,
      <kbd>C-z</kbd> will either iconify Emacs (if Emacs runs as an
      application under X) or it will stop Emacs (if Emacs runs on
      a dumb terminal or in an Xterm window).<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Vi
    state</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      This is the Vi command mode. Any of the Vi commands, such as
      <kbd>i, o, a</kbd>, <small class="dots">...</small>, will
      take you to Insert state. All Vi commands may be used in this
      mode. Most Ex commands can also be used. For a full list of
      Ex commands supported by Viper, type <kbd>:</kbd> and then
      &lt;TAB&gt;. To get help on any issue, including the Ex
      commands, type <kbd>:help</kbd>. This will invoke Viper Info
      (if it is installed). Then typing <kbd>i</kbd> will prompt
      you for a topic to search in the index. Note: to search for
      Ex commands in the index, you should start them with a
      <kbd>:</kbd>, e.g., <kbd>:WW</kbd>.

      <p>In Viper, Ex commands can be made to work on the current
      Emacs region. This is done by typing a digit argument before
      <kbd>:</kbd>. For instance, typing <kbd>1:</kbd> will prompt
      you with something like <em>:123,135</em>, assuming that the
      current region starts at line 123 and ends at line 135. There
      is no need to type the line numbers, since Viper inserts them
      automatically in front of the Ex command.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Insert
    state</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>Insert state is the Vi insertion mode. &lt;ESC&gt; will
    take you back to Vi state. Insert state editing can be done,
    including auto-indentation. By default, Viper disables Emacs
    key bindings in Insert state.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Replace
    state</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>Commands like <kbd>cw</kbd> invoke the Replace state. When
    you cross the boundary of a replacement region (usually
    designated via a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; sign), it will automatically
    change to Insert state. You do not have to worry about it. The
    key bindings remain practically the same as in Insert state. If
    you type &lt;ESC&gt;, Viper will switch to Vi command mode,
    terminating the replacement state.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p><a name="index-mode-line-34" id="index-mode-line-34"></a> The
  modes are indicated on the <dfn>mode line</dfn> as &lt;E&gt;,
  &lt;I&gt;, &lt;V&gt;, and &lt;R&gt;, so that the multiple modes
  do not confuse you. Most of your editing can be done in Vi and
  Insert states. Viper will try to make all new buffers be in Vi
  state, but sometimes they may come up in Emacs state.
  <kbd>C-z</kbd> will take you to Vi state in such a case. In some
  major modes, like Dired, Info, Gnus, etc., you should not switch
  to Vi state (and Viper will not attempt to do so) because these
  modes are not intended for text editing and many of the Vi keys
  have special meaning there. If you plan to read news, browse
  directories, read mail, etc., from Emacs (which you should start
  doing soon!), you should learn about the meaning of the various
  keys in those special modes (typing <kbd>C-h m</kbd> in a buffer
  provides help with key bindings for the major mode of that
  buffer).</p>

  <p>If you switch to Vi in Dired or similar modes&mdash;no harm is
  done. It is just that the special key bindings provided by those
  modes will be temporarily overshadowed by Viper's bindings.
  Switching back to Viper's Emacs state will revive the environment
  provided by the current major mode.</p>

  <p>States in Viper are orthogonal to Emacs major modes, such as C
  mode or Dired mode. You can turn Viper on and off for any Emacs
  state. When Viper is turned on, Vi state can be used to move
  around. In Insert state, the bindings for these modes can be
  accessed. For beginners (users at Viper levels 1 and 2), these
  bindings are suppressed in Insert state, so that new users are
  not confused by the Emacs states. Note that unless you allow
  Emacs bindings in Insert state, you cannot do many interesting
  things, like language sensitive editing. For the novice user (at
  Viper level 1), all major mode bindings are turned off in Vi
  state as well. This includes the bindings for key sequences that
  start with <kbd>C-c</kbd>, which practically means that all major
  mode bindings are unsupported. See <a href=
  "Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>, to find out
  how to allow Emacs keys in Insert state.</p>
