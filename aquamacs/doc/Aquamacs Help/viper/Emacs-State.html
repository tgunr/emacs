  <h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 Emacs State</h4>

  <p><a name="index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002dz_007d-35" id=
  "index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002dz_007d-35"></a><a name=

  <p>You will be in this mode only by accident (hopefully). This is
  the state Emacs is normally in (imagine!!). Now leave it as soon
  as possible by typing <kbd>C-z</kbd>. Then you will be in Vi
  state (sigh of relief) :-).</p>

  <p>Emacs state is actually a Viperism to denote all the major and
  minor modes (see <a href=
  "Emacs-Preliminaries.html#Emacs-Preliminaries">Emacs
  Preliminaries</a>) other than Viper that Emacs can be in. Emacs
  can have several modes, such as C mode for editing C programs,
  LaTeX mode for editing LaTeX documents, Dired for directory
  editing, etc. These are major modes, each with a different set of
  key-bindings. Viper states are orthogonal to these Emacs major
  modes. The presence of these language sensitive and other modes
  is a major win over Vi. See <a href=
  "Improvements-over-Vi.html#Improvements-over-Vi">Improvements
  over Vi</a>, for more.</p>

  <p>The bindings for these modes can be made available in the
  Viper Insert state as well as in Emacs state. Unless you specify
  your user level as 1 (a novice), all major mode key sequences
  that start with <kbd>C-x</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd> are also
  available in Vi state. This is important because major modes
  designed for editing files, such as cc-mode or latex-mode, use
  key sequences that begin with <kbd>C-x</kbd> and
  <kbd>C-c</kbd>.</p>

  <p>There is also a key that lets you temporarily escape to Vi
  command state from the Insert state: typing <kbd>C-z</kbd> will
  let you execute a single Vi command while staying in Viper's
  Insert state.</p>
