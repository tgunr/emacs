  <h4 class="subsection">1.3.2 Vi State</h4>

  <p><a name="index-Vi-state-37" id="index-Vi-state-37"></a> This
  is the Vi command mode. When Viper is in Vi state, you will see
  the sign &lt;V&gt; in the mode line. Most keys will work as in
  Vi. The notable exceptions are:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><kbd>C-x</kbd></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002dx_007d-38" id=
    "index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002dx_007d-38"></a><kbd>C-x</kbd> is
    used to invoke Emacs commands, mainly those that do window
    management. <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> will split a window, <kbd>C-x
    0</kbd> will close a window. <kbd>C-x 1</kbd> will close all
    other windows. <kbd>C-xb</kbd> is used to switch buffers in a
    window, and <kbd>C-xo</kbd> to move through windows. These are
    about the only necessary keystrokes. For the rest, see the GNU
    Emacs Manual.<br /></dd>

    <dt><kbd>C-c</kbd></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002dc_007d-39" id=
    "index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002dc_007d-39"></a>For user levels 2
    and higher, this key serves as a prefix key for the key
    sequences used by various major modes. For users at Viper level
    1, <kbd>C-c</kbd> simply beeps.<br /></dd>

    <dt><kbd>C-g and C-]</kbd></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002dg_007d-40" id=
    "index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002dg_007d-40"></a><a name=
    "index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002d_005d_007d-41" id=
    "index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002d_005d_007d-41"></a> These are the
    Emacs &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">quit</span></samp>&rsquo;
    keys. There will be cases where you will have to use
    <kbd>C-g</kbd> to quit. Similarly, <kbd>C-]</kbd> is used to
    exit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Recursive
    Edits</span></samp>&rsquo; in Emacs for which there is no
    comparable Vi functionality and no key-binding. Recursive edits
    are indicated by &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo; brackets framing the modes on
    the mode line. See <a href=
    "../emacs/Recursive-Edit.html#Recursive-Edit">Recursive
    Edit</a>. At user level 1, <kbd>C-g</kbd> is bound to
    <code>viper-info-on-file</code> function instead.<br /></dd>

    <dt><kbd>C-\</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002d_005c_007d-42" id=
      "index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002d_005c_007d-42"></a><a name=
      "index-Meta-key-43" id="index-Meta-key-43"></a> Viper uses
      &lt;ESC&gt; as a switch between Insert and Vi states. Emacs
      uses &lt;ESC&gt; for Meta. The Meta key is very important in
      Emacs since many functions are accessible only via that key
      as <kbd>M-x function-name</kbd>. Therefore, we need to
      simulate it somehow. In Viper's Vi, Insert, and Replace
      states, the meta key is set to be <kbd>C-\</kbd>. Thus, to
      get <kbd>M-x</kbd>, you should type <kbd>C-\ x</kbd> (if the
      keyboard has no Meta key, which is rare these days). This
      works both in the Vi command state and in the Insert and
      Replace states. In Vi command state, you can also use <kbd>\
      &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> as the meta key.

      <p>Note: Emacs binds <kbd>C-\</kbd> to a function that offers
      to change the keyboard input method in the multilingual
      environment. Viper overrides this binding. However, it is
      still possible to switch the input method by typing <kbd>\
      C-\</kbd> in the Vi command state and <kbd>C-z \ C-\</kbd> in
      the Insert state. Or you can use the MULE menu in the
      menubar.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>Other differences are mostly improvements. The ones you
  should know about are:

  <dl>
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Undo</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd><a name="index-g_t_0040kbd_007bu_007d-44" id=
    "index-g_t_0040kbd_007bu_007d-44"></a><kbd>u</kbd> will undo.
    Undo can be repeated by the <kbd>.</kbd> key. Undo itself can
    be undone. Another <kbd>u</kbd> will change the direction. The
    presence of repeatable undo means that <kbd>U</kbd>, undoing
    lines, is not very important. Therefore, <kbd>U</kbd> also
    calls <code>viper-undo</code>. <a name="index-multiple-undo-45"
    id="index-multiple-undo-45"></a><a name="index-undo-46" id=
    "index-undo-46"></a><br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Counts</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>Most commands, <kbd>~</kbd>, <kbd>[[</kbd>, <kbd>p</kbd>,
    <kbd>/</kbd>, <small class="dots">...</small>, etc., take
    counts. <!-- ]] Just to balance parens -->
    <br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Regexps</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>Viper uses Emacs Regular Expressions for searches. These
    are a superset of Vi regular expressions, excepting the
    change-of-case escapes &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">\u</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">\L</span></samp>&rsquo;, <small class=
    "dots">...</small>, etc. See <a href=
    "../emacs/Regexps.html#Regexps">Syntax of Regular
    Expressions</a>, for details. Files specified to <kbd>:e</kbd>
    use <code>csh</code> regular expressions (globbing, wildcards,
    what have you). However, the function
    <code>viper-toggle-search-style</code>, bound to <kbd>C-c
    /</kbd>, lets the user switch from search with regular
    expressions to plain vanilla search and vice versa. It also
    lets one switch from case-sensitive search to case-insensitive
    and back. See <a href=
    "Viper-Specials.html#Viper-Specials">Viper Specials</a>, for
    more details. <a name="index-regular-expressions-47" id=

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ex
    commands</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-Ex-commands-52" id=
      "index-Ex-commands-52"></a>The current working directory of a
      buffer is automatically inserted in the minibuffer if you
      type <kbd>:e</kbd> then space. Absolute filenames are
      required less often in Viper. For file names, Emacs uses a
      convention that is slightly different from other programs. It
      is designed to minimize the need for deleting file names that
      Emacs provides in its prompts. (This is usually convenient,
      but occasionally the prompt may suggest a wrong file name for
      you.) If you see a prompt <kbd>/usr/foo/</kbd> and you wish
      to edit the file <kbd>~/.viper</kbd>, you don't have to erase
      the prompt. Instead, simply continue typing what you need.
      Emacs will interpret <kbd>/usr/foo/~/.viper</kbd> correctly.
      Similarly, if the prompt is <kbd>~/foo/</kbd> and you need to
      get to <kbd>/bar/file</kbd>, keep typing. Emacs interprets
      <kbd>~/foo//bar/</kbd> as <kbd>/bar/file</kbd>, since when it
      sees &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>&rsquo;,
      it understands that <kbd>~/foo/</kbd> is to be discarded.

      <p>The command <kbd>:cd</kbd> will change the default
      directory for the current buffer. The command <kbd>:e</kbd>
      will interpret the filename argument in <code>csh</code>. See
      <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>,
      if you want to change the default shell. The command
      <kbd>:next</kbd> takes counts from <kbd>:args</kbd>, so that
      <kbd>:rew</kbd> is obsolete. Also, <kbd>:args</kbd> will show
      only the invisible files (i.e., those that are not currently
      seen in Emacs windows).</p>

      <p>When applicable, Ex commands support file completion and
      history. This means that by typing a partial file name and
      then &lt;TAB&gt;, Emacs will try to complete the name or it
      will offer a menu of possible completions. This works
      similarly to Tcsh and extends the behavior of Csh. While
      Emacs is waiting for a file name, you can type <kbd>M-p</kbd>
      to get the previous file name you typed. Repeatedly typing
      <kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-n</kbd> will let you browse through
      the file history.</p>

      <p>Like file names, partially typed Ex commands can be
      completed by typing &lt;TAB&gt;, and Viper keeps the history
      of Ex commands. After typing <kbd>:</kbd>, you can browse
      through the previously entered Ex commands by typing
      <kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-n</kbd>. Viper tries to rationalize
      when it puts Ex commands on the history list. For instance,
      if you typed <kbd>:w! foo</kbd>, only <kbd>:w!</kbd> will be
      placed on the history list. This is because the last history
      element is the default that can be invoked simply by typing
      <kbd>: &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. If <kbd>:w! foo</kbd> were placed
      on the list, it would be all to easy to override valuable
      data in another file. Reconstructing the full command,
      <kbd>:w! foo</kbd>, from the history is still not that hard,
      since Viper has a separate history for file names. By typing
      <kbd>: M-p</kbd>, you will get <kbd>:w!</kbd> in the
      minibuffer. Then, repeated <kbd>M-p</kbd> will get you
      through the file history, inserting one file name after
      another.</p>

      <p>In contrast to <kbd>:w! foo</kbd>, if the command were
      <kbd>:r foo</kbd>, the entire command will appear in the
      history list. This is because having <kbd>:r</kbd> alone as a
      default is meaningless, since this command requires a file
      argument.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>As in Vi, Viper's destructive commands can be re-executed by
  typing `<kbd>.</kbd>'. However, in addition, Viper keeps track of
  the history of such commands. This history can be perused by
  typing <kbd>C-c M-p</kbd> and <kbd>C-c M-n</kbd>. Having found
  the appropriate command, it can be then executed by typing
  `<kbd>.</kbd>'. See <a href=
  "Improvements-over-Vi.html#Improvements-over-Vi">Improvements
  over Vi</a>, for more information.
