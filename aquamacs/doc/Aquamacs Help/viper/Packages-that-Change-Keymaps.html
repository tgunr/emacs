  <h4 class="subsection">3.2.1 Packages that Change Keymaps</h4>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dc-and-Viper-232" id=
  "index-C_002dc-and-Viper-232"></a><a name=
  "index-Viper-and-C_002dc-233" id=
  "index-Viper-and-C_002dc-233"></a> Viper is designed to coexist
  with all major and minor modes of Emacs. This means that bindings
  set by those modes are generally available with Viper (unless you
  explicitly prohibit them by setting
  <code>viper-want-emacs-keys-in-vi</code> and
  <code>viper-want-emacs-keys-in-insert</code> to
  <code>nil</code>). If <code>viper-always</code> is set to
  <code>t</code> (which is the default), Viper will try to bring
  each buffer in the Viper state that is most appropriate for that
  buffer. Usually, this would be the Vi state, but sometimes it
  could be the Insert state or the Emacs state.</p>

  <p>Some major mode bindings will necessarily be overwritten by
  Viper. Indeed, in Vi state, most of the 1-character keys are used
  for Vi-style editing. This usually causes no problems because
  most packages designed for editing files typically do not bind
  such keys. Instead, they use key sequences that start with
  <kbd>C-x</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd>. This is why it was so
  important for us to free up <kbd>C-x</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd>. It
  is common for language-specific major modes to bind &lt;TAB&gt;
  and <kbd>C-j</kbd> (the line feed) keys to various formatting
  functions. This is extremely useful, but may require some getting
  used to for a Vi user. If you decide that this feature is not for
  you, you can re-bind these keys as explained earlier (see
  <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>).</p>

  <p>Binding for &lt;TAB&gt; is one of the most unusual aspects of
  Viper for many novice users. In Emacs, &lt;TAB&gt; is used to
  format text and programs, and is extremely useful. For instance,
  hitting &lt;TAB&gt; causes the current line to be re-indented in
  accordance with the context. In programming, this is very
  important, since improper automatic indentation would immediately
  alert the programmer to a possible error. For instance, if a
  <kbd>)</kbd> or a <kbd>"</kbd> is missing somewhere above the
  current line, &lt;TAB&gt; is likely to mis-indent the line.</p>

  <p>For this reason, Viper doesn't change the standard Emacs
  binding of &lt;TAB&gt;, thereby sacrificing Vi compatibility
  (except for users at level 1). Instead, in Viper, the key
  <kbd>S-tab</kbd> (shift+ tab) is chosen to emulate Vi's
  &lt;TAB&gt;.</p>

  <p>We should note that on some non-windowing terminals, Shift
  doesn't modify the &lt;TAB&gt; key, so <kbd>S-tab</kbd> behaves
  as if it were &lt;TAB&gt;. In such a case, you will have to bind
  <code>viper-insert-tab</code> to some other convenient key.</p>

  <p>Some packages, notably Dired, Gnus, Info, etc., attach special
  meaning to common keys like &lt;SPC&gt;, <kbd>x</kbd>,
  <kbd>d</kbd>, <kbd>v</kbd>, and others. This means that Vi
  command state is inappropriate for working with these packages.
  Fortunately, these modes operate on read-only buffers and are
  designed not for editing files, but for special-purpose browsing,
  reading news, mail, etc., and Vi commands are meaningless in
  these situations. For this reason, Viper doesn't force Vi state
  on such major modes&mdash;it brings them in Emacs state. You can
  switch to Vi state by typing <kbd>C-z</kbd> if, for instance, you
  want to do Vi-style search in a buffer (although, usually,
  incremental search, which is bound to <kbd>C-s</kbd>, is
  sufficient in these situations). But you should then switch back
  to Emacs state if you plan to continue using these major modes
  productively. You can also switch to Vi temporarily, to execute
  just one command. This is done by typing <kbd>C-c \</kbd>. (In
  some of these modes, <kbd>/</kbd> and <kbd>:</kbd> are bound
  Vi-style, unless these keys perform essential duties.)</p>

  <p>If you would like certain major modes to come up in Emacs
  state rather than Vi state (but Viper thinks otherwise), you
  should put these major modes on the
  <code>viper-emacs-state-mode-list</code> list and delete them
  from <code>viper-vi-state-mode-list</code>. Likewise, you can
  force Viper's Insert state on a major mode by putting it in
  <code>viper-insert-state-mode-list</code>. <a name=
  "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002demacs_002dstate_002dmode_002dlist_007d-234"
  id=
  "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002demacs_002dstate_002dmode_002dlist_007d-234">
  </a><a name=
  "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dinsert_002dstate_002dmode_002dlist_007d-235"
  id=
  "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dinsert_002dstate_002dmode_002dlist_007d-235"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dvi_002dstate_002dmode_002dlist_007d-236"
  id=
  "index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dvi_002dstate_002dmode_002dlist_007d-236"></a>
  It is also possible to impose Vi on some major modes, even though
  they may bind common keys to specialized commands. This might
  make sense for modes that bind only a small number of common
  keys. For instance, Viper subverts the Shell mode by changing the
  bindings for <kbd>C-m</kbd> and <kbd>C-d</kbd> using
  <code>viper-add-local-keys</code> described in the section on
  customization (see <a href=
  "Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>).</p>

  <p>In some cases, some <em>minor</em> modes might override
  certain essential bindings in Vi command state. This is not a big
  problem because this can happen only in the beginning, when the
  minor mode kicks in. Typing <code>M-x viper-mode</code> will
  correct the situation. Viper knows about several such minor modes
  and takes care of them, so the above trick is usually not
  necessary. If you find that some minor mode, e.g.,
  <code>nasty-mode</code> interferes with Viper, putting the
  following in <samp><span class="file">.viper</span></samp> should
  fix the problem:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (viper-harness-minor-mode "nasty-mode")
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The argument to
  <code>viper-harness-minor-mode</code> is the name of the file for
  the offending minor mode with the suffixes <samp><span class=
  "file">.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class=
  "file">.elc</span></samp> removed.</p>

  <p>It may not be always obvious which minor mode is at fault. The
  only guidance here is to look into the file that defines the
  minor mode you are suspecting, say <samp><span class=
  "file">nasty-mode.el</span></samp>, and see if it has a variable
  called <code>nasty-mode-map</code>. Then check if there is a
  statement of the form</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (define-key nasty-mode-map key function)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">that binds the misbehaving keys. If so, use
  the above line to harness <code>nasty-mode</code>. If your
  suspicion is wrong, no harm is done if you harness a minor mode
  that doesn't need to be harnessed.</p>

  <p>It is recommended to harness even those minor modes that don't
  override Viper keys, but still have their own keymaps. A general
  way to make a minor mode, <code>my-mode</code>, compatible with
  Viper is to have the file <samp><span class=
  "file">my-mode.el</span></samp> include the following code:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (when (fboundp 'viper-harness-minor-mode)
       (let ((lib (file-name-sans-extension
                    (file-name-nondirectory load-file-name))))
         (viper-harness-minor-mode lib)))
</pre>
