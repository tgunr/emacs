  <h4 class="subsection">1.3.3 Insert State</h4>

  <p><a name="index-Insert-state-53" id=
  "index-Insert-state-53"></a> To avoid confusing the beginner (at
  Viper level 1 and 2), Viper makes only the standard Vi keys
  available in Insert state. The implication is that Emacs major
  modes cannot be used in Insert state. It is strongly recommended
  that as soon as you are comfortable, make the Emacs state
  bindings visible (by changing your user level to 3 or higher).
  See <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>,
  to see how to do this.</p>

  <p>Once this is done, it is possible to do quite a bit of editing
  in Insert state. For instance, Emacs has a <dfn>yank</dfn>
  command, <kbd>C-y</kbd>, which is similar to Vi's <kbd>p</kbd>.
  However, unlike <kbd>p</kbd>, <kbd>C-y</kbd> can be used in
  Insert state of Viper. Emacs also has a kill ring where it keeps
  pieces of text you deleted while editing buffers. The command
  <kbd>M-y</kbd> is used to delete the text previously put back by
  Emacs' <kbd>C-y</kbd> or by Vi's <kbd>p</kbd> command and
  reinsert text that was placed on the kill-ring earlier.</p>

  <p>This works both in Vi and Insert states. In Vi state,
  <kbd>M-y</kbd> is a much better alternative to the usual Vi's way
  of recovering the 10 previously deleted chunks of text. In Insert
  state, you can use this as follows. Suppose you deleted a piece
  of text and now you need to re-insert it while editing in Insert
  mode. The key <kbd>C-y</kbd> will put back the most recently
  deleted chunk. If this is not what you want, type <kbd>M-y</kbd>
  repeatedly and, hopefully, you will find the chunk you want.</p>

  <p>Finally, in Insert and Replace states, Viper provides the
  history of pieces of text inserted in previous insert or replace
  commands. These strings of text can be recovered by repeatedly
  typing <kbd>C-c M-p</kbd> or <kbd>C-c M-n</kbd> while in Insert
  or Replace state. (This feature is disabled in the minibuffer:
  the above keys are usually bound to other histories, which are
  more appropriate in the minibuffer.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-Meta-key-54" id="index-Meta-key-54"></a> You
  can call Meta functions from Insert state. As in Vi state, the
  Meta key is <kbd>C-\</kbd>. Thus <kbd>M-x</kbd> is typed as
  <kbd>C-\ x</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Other Emacs commands that are useful in Insert state are
  <kbd>C-e</kbd> and <kbd>C-a</kbd>, which move the cursor to the
  end and the beginning of the current line, respectively. You can
  also use <kbd>M-f</kbd> and <kbd>M-b</kbd>, which move the cursor
  forward (or backward) one word. If your display has a Meta key,
  these functions are invoked by holding the Meta key and then
  typing <kbd>f</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>, respectively. On displays
  without the Meta key, these functions are invoked by typing
  <kbd>C-\ f</kbd> and <kbd>C-\ b</kbd> (<kbd>C-\</kbd> simulates
  the Meta key in Insert state, as explained above).</p>

  <p>The key <kbd>C-z</kbd> is sometimes also useful in Insert
  state: it allows you to execute a single command in Vi state
  without leaving the Insert state! For instance, <kbd>C-z
  d2w</kbd> will delete the next two words without leaving the
  Insert state.</p>

  <p>When Viper is in Insert state, you will see &lt;I&gt; in the
  mode line.</p>
