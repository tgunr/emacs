  "index-region-8"></a> Emacs can edit several files at once. A
  file in Emacs is placed in a <dfn>buffer</dfn> that usually has
  the same name as the file. Buffers are also used for other
  purposes, such as shell interfaces, directory editing, etc. See
  <a href="../emacs/Dired.html#Dired">Directory Editor</a>, for an
  example.</p>

  <p>A buffer has a distinguished position called the
  <dfn>point</dfn>. A <dfn>point</dfn> is always between 2
  characters, and is <dfn>looking at</dfn> the right hand
  character. The cursor is positioned on the right hand character.
  Thus, when the <dfn>point</dfn> is looking at the end-of-line,
  the cursor is on the end-of-line character, i.e. beyond the last
  character on the line. This is the default Emacs behavior.</p>

  <p>The default settings of Viper try to mimic the behavior of Vi,
  preventing the cursor from going beyond the last character on the
  line. By using Emacs commands directly (such as those bound to
  arrow keys), it is possible to get the cursor beyond the
  end-of-line. However, this won't (or shouldn't) happen if you
  restrict yourself to standard Vi keys, unless you modify the
  default editing style. See <a href=
  "Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition to the <dfn>point</dfn>, there is another
  distinguished buffer position called the <dfn>mark</dfn>. See
  <a href="../emacs/Mark.html#Mark">Mark</a>, for more info on the
  mark. The text between the <dfn>point</dfn> and the
  <dfn>mark</dfn> is called the <dfn>region</dfn> of the buffer.
  For the Viper user, this simply means that in addition to the Vi
  textmarkers a&ndash;z, there is another marker called
  <dfn>mark</dfn>. This is similar to the unnamed Vi marker used by
  the jump commands <kbd>``</kbd> and <kbd>''</kbd>, which move the
  cursor to the position of the last absolute jump. Viper provides
  access to the region in most text manipulation commands as
  <kbd>r</kbd> and <kbd>R</kbd> suffix to commands that operate on
  text regions, e.g., <kbd>dr</kbd> to delete region, etc.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Viper lets Ex-style commands to work on the
  current region. This is done by typing a digit argument before
  <kbd>:</kbd>. For instance, typing <kbd>1:</kbd> will prompt you
  with something like <em>:123,135</em>, assuming that the current
  region starts at line 123 and ends at line 135. There is no need
  to type the line numbers, since Viper inserts them automatically
  in front of the Ex command.</p>

  <p>See <a href="Basics.html#Basics">Basics</a>, for more
  info.</p>

  screen into tiled <dfn>windows</dfn>. You can see the contents of
  a buffer through the window associated with the buffer. The
  cursor of the screen is positioned on the character after
  <dfn>point</dfn>. Every window has a <dfn>mode line</dfn> that
  displays information about the buffer. You can change the format
  of the mode line, but normally if you see
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">**</span></samp>&rsquo; at the
  beginning of a mode line it means that the buffer is
  <dfn>modified</dfn>. If you write out the contents of a buffer to
  a file, then the buffer will become not modified. Also if you see
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo; at the
  beginning of the mode line, it means that the file associated
  with the buffer is write protected. The mode line will also show
  the buffer name and current major and minor modes (see below). A
  special buffer called <dfn>Minibuffer</dfn> is displayed as the
  last line in a minibuffer window. The minibuffer window is used
  for command input output. Viper uses minibuffer window for
  <kbd>/</kbd> and <kbd>:</kbd> commands.</p>

  "index-minor-mode-20" id="index-minor-mode-20"></a> An Emacs
  buffer can have a <dfn>major mode</dfn> that customizes Emacs for
  editing text of a particular sort by changing the functionality
  of the keys. Keys are defined using a <dfn>keymap</dfn> that
  records the bindings between keystrokes and functions. The
  <dfn>global keymap</dfn> is common to all the buffers.
  Additionally, each buffer has its <dfn>local keymap</dfn> that
  determines the <dfn>mode</dfn> of the buffer. If a function is
  bound to some key in the local keymap then that function will be
  executed when you type the key. If no function is bound to a key
  in the local map, however, the function bound to the key in the
  global map will be executed. See <a href=
  "../emacs/Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>, for more
  information.</p>

  <p>A buffer can also have a <dfn>minor mode</dfn>. Minor modes
  are options that you can use or not. A buffer in
  <code>text-mode</code> can have <code>auto-fill-mode</code> as
  minor mode, which can be turned off or on at any time. In Emacs,
  a minor mode may have it own keymap, which overrides the local
  keymap when the minor mode is turned on. For more information,
  see <a href="../emacs/Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor
  Modes</a></p>

  "index-Control-keys-22" id="index-Control-keys-22"></a><a name=
  "index-Meta-key-23" id="index-Meta-key-23"></a> Viper is
  implemented as a collection of minor modes. Different minor modes
  are involved when Viper emulates Vi command mode, Vi insert mode,
  etc. You can also turn Viper on and off at any time while in Vi
  command mode. See <a href=
  "States-in-Viper.html#States-in-Viper">States in Viper</a>, for
  more information.</p>

  <p>Emacs uses Control and Meta modifiers. These are denoted as C
  and M, e.g. <kbd>^Z</kbd> as <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>Meta-x</kbd>
  as <kbd>M-x</kbd>. The Meta key is usually located on each side
  of the Space bar; it is used in a manner similar to the Control
  key, e.g., <kbd>M-x</kbd> means typing <kbd>x</kbd> while holding
  the Meta key down. For keyboards that do not have a Meta key,
  &lt;ESC&gt; is used as Meta. Thus <kbd>M-x</kbd> is typed as
  <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; x</kbd>. Viper uses &lt;ESC&gt; to switch from
  Insert state to Vi state. Therefore Viper defines <kbd>C-\</kbd>
  as its Meta key in Vi state. See <a href=
  "Vi-State.html#Vi-State">Vi State</a>, for more info.</p>

  <p>Emacs is structured as a Lisp interpreter around a C core.
  Emacs keys cause Lisp functions to be called. It is possible to
  call these functions directly, by typing <kbd>M-x
  function-name</kbd>.</p>
