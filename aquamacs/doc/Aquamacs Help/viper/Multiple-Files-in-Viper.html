  <h3 class="section">1.5 Multiple Files in Viper</h3>

  <p><a name="index-multiple-files-57" id=
  "index-multiple-files-57"></a><a name=
  "index-managing-multiple-files-58" id=
  "index-managing-multiple-files-58"></a> Viper can edit multiple
  files. This means, for example that you never need to suffer
  through <code>No write since last change</code> errors. Some
  Viper elements are common over all the files.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Textmarkers</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd><a name="index-markers-59" id=
    "index-markers-59"></a><a name="index-textmarkers-60" id=
    "index-textmarkers-60"></a>Textmarkers remember <em>files and
    positions</em>. If you set marker &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; in file <samp><span class=
    "file">foo</span></samp>, start editing file <samp><span class=
    "file">bar</span></samp> and type <kbd>'a</kbd>, then <em>YOU
    WILL SWITCH TO FILE</em> <samp><span class=
    "file">foo</span></samp>. You can see the contents of a
    textmarker using the Viper command <kbd>[&lt;a-z&gt;</kbd>
    where &lt;a-z&gt; are the textmarkers, e.g., <kbd>[a</kbd> to
    view marker &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; .<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Repeated
    Commands</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>Command repetitions are common over files. Typing
    <kbd>!!</kbd> will repeat the last <kbd>!</kbd> command
    whichever file it was issued from. Typing <kbd>.</kbd> will
    repeat the last command from any file, and searches will repeat
    the last search. Ex commands can be repeated by typing <kbd>:
    &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. Note: in some rare cases, that <kbd>:
    &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> may do something dangerous. However, usually
    its effect can be undone by typing <kbd>u</kbd>.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Registers</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-registers-61" id=
      "index-registers-61"></a>Registers are common to files. Also,
      text yanked with <kbd>y</kbd> can be put back (<kbd>p</kbd>)
      into any file. The Viper command <kbd>]&lt;a-z&gt;</kbd>,
      where &lt;a-z&gt; are the registers, can be used to look at
      the contents of a register, e.g., type <kbd>]a</kbd> to view
      register &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;.

      <p>There is one difference in text deletion that you should
      be aware of. This difference comes from Emacs and was adopted
      in Viper because we find it very useful. In Vi, if you delete
      a line, say, and then another line, these two deletions are
      separated and are put back separately if you use the
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo;
      command. In Emacs (and Viper), successive series of deletions
      that are <em>not interrupted</em> by other commands are
      lumped together, so the deleted text gets accumulated and can
      be put back as one chunk. If you want to break a sequence of
      deletions so that the newly deleted text could be put back
      separately from the previously deleted text, you should
      perform a non-deleting action, e.g., move the cursor one
      character in any direction.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Absolute
    Filenames</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-absolute-file-names-62" id=
      "index-absolute-file-names-62"></a>The current directory name
      for a file is automatically prepended to the file name in any
      <kbd>:e</kbd>, <kbd>:r</kbd>, <kbd>:w</kbd>, etc., command
      (in Emacs, each buffer has a current directory). This
      directory is inserted in the minibuffer once you type space
      after <kbd>:e, r</kbd>, etc. Viper also supports completion
      of file names and Ex commands (&lt;TAB&gt;), and it keeps
      track of command and file history (<kbd>M-p</kbd>,
      <kbd>M-n</kbd>). Absolute filenames are required less often
      in Viper.

      <p>You should be aware that Emacs interprets
      <kbd>/foo/bar//bla</kbd> as <kbd>/bla</kbd> and
      <kbd>/foo/~/bar</kbd> as <kbd>~/bar</kbd>. This is designed
      to minimize the need for erasing file names that Emacs
      suggests in its prompts, if a suggested file name is not what
      you wanted.</p>

      <p>The command <kbd>:cd</kbd> will change the default
      directory for the current Emacs buffer. The Ex command
      <kbd>:e</kbd> will interpret the filename argument in
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">csh</span></samp>&rsquo;, by
      default. See <a href=
      "Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>, if you
      want to change this.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p class="noindent">Currently undisplayed files can be listed
  using the <kbd>:ar</kbd> command. The command <kbd>:n</kbd> can
  be given counts from the <kbd>:ar</kbd> list to switch to other
  files. For example, use `:n3' to move to the third file in that
  list.</p>
