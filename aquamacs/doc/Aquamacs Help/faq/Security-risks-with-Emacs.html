     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

  Emacs?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The <samp><span class="file">movemail</span></samp>
    incident. (No, this is not a risk.)

      <p>In his book <cite>The Cuckoo's Egg</cite>, Cliff Stoll
      describes this in chapter 4. The site at LBL had installed
      the <samp><span class="file">/etc/movemail</span></samp>
      program setuid root. (As of version 19, <samp><span class=
      "file">movemail</span></samp> is in your
      architecture-specific directory; type <kbd>C-h v
      exec-directory &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to see what it is.) Since
      <code>movemail</code> had not been designed for this
      situation, a security hole was created and users could get
      root privileges.</p>

      <p><code>movemail</code> has since been changed so that this
      security hole will not exist, even if it is installed setuid
      root. However, <code>movemail</code> no longer needs to be
      installed setuid root, which should eliminate this particular
      risk.</p>

      <p>We have heard unverified reports that the 1988 Internet
      worm took advantage of this configuration problem.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The <code>file-local-variable</code> feature. (Yes, a risk,
    but easy to change.)

      <p>There is an Emacs feature that allows the setting of local
      values for variables when editing a file by including
      specially formatted text near the end of the file. This
      feature also includes the ability to have arbitrary Emacs
      Lisp code evaluated when the file is visited. Obviously,
      there is a potential for Trojan horses to exploit this
      feature.</p>

      <p>As of Emacs 22, Emacs has a list of local variables that
      are known to be safe to set. If a file tries to set any
      variable outside this list, it asks the user to confirm
      whether the variables should be set. You can also tell Emacs
      whether to allow the evaluation of Emacs Lisp code found at
      the bottom of files by setting the variable
      <code>enable-local-eval</code>.</p>

      <p>For more information, see <a href=
      "../emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File
      Variables</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Synthetic X events. (Yes, a risk; use
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</span></samp>&rsquo; or better.)

      <p>Emacs accepts synthetic X events generated by the
      <code>SendEvent</code> request as though they were regular
      events. As a result, if you are using the trivial host-based
      authentication, other users who can open X connections to
      your X workstation can make your Emacs process do anything,
      including run other processes with your privileges.</p>

      <p>The only fix for this is to prevent other users from being
      able to open X connections. The standard way to prevent this
      is to use a real authentication mechanism, such as
      &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</span></samp>&rsquo;. If using the
      <code>xauth</code> program has any effect, then you are
      probably using &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</span></samp>&rsquo;. Your site may
      be using a superior authentication method; ask your system
      administrator.</p>

      <p>If real authentication is not a possibility, you may be
      satisfied by just allowing hosts access for brief intervals
      while you start your X programs, then removing the access.
      This reduces the risk somewhat by narrowing the time window
      when hostile users would have access, but <em>does not
      eliminate the risk</em>.</p>

      <p>On most computers running Unix and X, you enable and
      disable access using the <code>xhost</code> command. To allow
      all hosts access to your X server, use</p>
      <pre class="example">
          xhost +
</pre>

      <p class="noindent">at the shell prompt, which (on an HP
      machine, at least) produces the following message:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          access control disabled, clients can connect from any host
</pre>

      <p>To deny all hosts access to your X server (except those
      explicitly allowed by name), use</p>
      <pre class="example">
          xhost -
</pre>

      <p>On the test HP computer, this command generated the
      following message:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
