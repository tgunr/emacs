     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

  <p><a name="index-Differences-between-Emacs-21-and-Emacs-22-140"
  id=
  "index-Differences-between-Emacs-21-and-Emacs-22-140"></a><a name="index-Emacs-22_002c-new-features-in-141"
  id="index-Emacs-22_002c-new-features-in-141"></a> <a name=
  "index-GTK_002b-Toolkit-142" id="index-GTK_002b-Toolkit-142"></a>
  <a name="index-Drag_002dand_002ddrop-143" id=
  "index-Drag_002dand_002ddrop-143"></a></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Emacs can be built with GTK+ widgets, and supports
    drag-and-drop operation on X.

      <p><a name="index-Supported-systems-144" id=
      "index-Supported-systems-144"></a></p>
    </li>

    <li>Emacs 22 features support for GNU/Linux systems on S390 and
    x86-64 machines, as well as support for the Mac OS X and Cygwin
    operating systems.</li>

    <li>The native MS-Windows, and Mac OS X builds include full
    support for images, toolbar, and tooltips.</li>

    <li>Font Lock mode, Auto Compression mode, and File Name Shadow
    Mode are enabled by default.</li>

    <li>The maximum size of buffers is increased: on 32-bit
    machines, it is 256 MBytes for Emacs 23.1, and 512 MBytes for
    Emacs 23.2 and above.</li>

    <li>Links can be followed with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>, in addition
    to <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>.

      <p><a name="index-Mouse-wheel-145" id=
      "index-Mouse-wheel-145"></a></p>
    </li>

    <li>Mouse wheel support is enabled by default.</li>

    <li>Window fringes are customizable.</li>

    <li>The mode line of the selected window is now
    highlighted.</li>

    <li>The minibuffer prompt is displayed in a distinct face.</li>

    <li>Abbrev definitions are read automatically at startup.</li>

    <li>Grep mode is separate from Compilation mode and has many
    new options and commands specific to grep.</li>

    <li>The original Emacs macro system has been replaced by the
    new Kmacro package, which provides many new commands and
    features and a simple interface that uses the function keys F3
    and F4. Macros are stored in a macro ring, and can be debugged
    and edited interactively.</li>

    <li>The Grand Unified Debugger (GUD) can be used with a full
    graphical user interface to GDB; this provides many features
    found in traditional development environments, making it easy
    to manipulate breakpoints, add watch points, display the call
    stack, etc. Breakpoints are visually indicated in the source
    buffer.</li>

    <li>
      <a name="index-New-modes-146" id=
      "index-New-modes-146"></a>Many new modes and packages have
      been included in Emacs, such as Calc, TRAMP, URL, IDO, CUA,
      ERC, rcirc, Table, Image-Dired, SES, Ruler, Org, PGG,
      Flymake, Password, Printing, Reveal, wdired, t-mouse,
      longlines, savehist, Conf mode, Python mode, DNS mode, etc.

      <p><a name="index-Multilingual-Environment-147" id=
      "index-Multilingual-Environment-147"></a></p>
    </li>

    <li>Leim is now part of Emacs. Unicode support has been much
    improved, and the following input methods have been added:

    croatian, dutch, georgian, latin-alt-postfix, latin-postfix,

      Georgian, Italian, Latin-6, Latin-7, Latvian, Lithuanian,
      Malayalam, Russian, Slovenian, Swedish, Tajik, Tamil, UTF-8,

    Manual (see <a href=

    Lisp documentation</a>) and the Emacs Lisp Intro.</li>
