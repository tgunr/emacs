     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

  copyleft?</h3>

  id="index-Discussion-of-the-GPL-44"></a> The real legal meaning
  of the GNU General Public License (copyleft) will only be known
  if and when a judge rules on its validity and scope. There has
  never been a copyright infringement case involving the GPL to set
  any precedents. Although legal actions have been brought against
  companies for violating the terms of the GPL, so far all have
  been settled out of court (in favour of the plaintiffs). Please
  take any discussion regarding this issue to the newsgroup
  <a href="news:gnu.misc.discuss">news:gnu.misc.discuss</a>, which
  was created to hold the extensive flame wars on the subject.</p>

  <p>RMS writes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    The legal meaning of the GNU copyleft is less important than
    the spirit, which is that Emacs is a free software project and
    that work pertaining to Emacs should also be free software.
    &ldquo;Free&rdquo; means that all users have the freedom to
    study, share, change and improve Emacs. To make sure everyone
    has this freedom, pass along source code when you distribute
    any version of Emacs or a related program, and give the
    recipients the same freedom that you enjoyed.
