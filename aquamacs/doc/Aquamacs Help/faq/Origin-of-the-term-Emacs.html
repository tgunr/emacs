     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

  <h3 class="section">4.1 Where does the name &ldquo;Emacs&rdquo;
  come from?</h3>

  <p><a name=
  "index-Origin-of-the-term-_0060_0060Emacs_0027_0027-115" id=
  "index-Origin-of-the-term-_0060_0060Emacs_0027_0027-115"></a><a name="index-Emacs-name-origin-116"
  id="index-Emacs-name-origin-116"></a><a name="index-TECO-117" id=

  "index-Original-version-of-Emacs-118" id=
  "index-Original-version-of-Emacs-118"></a> Emacs originally was
  an acronym for Editor MACroS. RMS says he &ldquo;picked the name
  Emacs because &lt;E&gt; was not in use as an abbreviation on ITS
  at the time.&rdquo; The first Emacs was a set of macros written
  in 1976 at MIT by RMS for the editor TECO (Text Editor and
  COrrector, originally Tape Editor and COrrector) under ITS (the
  Incompatible Timesharing System) on a PDP-10. RMS had already
  extended TECO with a &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; full-screen mode
  with reprogrammable keys. Emacs was started by <a href=
  "mailto:gls@east.sun.com">Guy Steele</a> as a project to unify
  the many divergent TECO command sets and key bindings at MIT, and
  completed by RMS.</p>

  <p>Many people have said that TECO code looks a lot like line
  noise; you can read more at <a href=
  "news:alt.lang.teco">news:alt.lang.teco</a>. Someone has written
  a TECO implementation in Emacs Lisp (to find it, see <a href=
  "Packages-that-do-not-come-with-Emacs.html#Packages-that-do-not-come-with-Emacs">
  Packages that do not come with Emacs</a>); it would be an
  interesting project to run the original TECO Emacs inside of
  Emacs.</p>

  alternative reasons for Emacs to have that name, check out the
  file <samp><span class="file">etc/JOKES</span></samp> (see
