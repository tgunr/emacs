     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

  <h3 class="section">10.6 Why does the &lt;Backspace&gt; key
  invoke help?</h3>

  <p><a name="index-Backspace-key-invokes-help-459" id=
  "index-Backspace-key-invokes-help-459"></a><a name=
  "index-Help-invoked-by-Backspace-460" id=

  "index-DEL-key-does-not-delete-461" id=
  "index-DEL-key-does-not-delete-461"></a> The &lt;Backspace&gt;
  key (on most keyboards) generates <acronym>ASCII</acronym> code
  8. <kbd>C-h</kbd> sends the same code. In Emacs by default
  <kbd>C-h</kbd> invokes help-command. This is intended to be easy
  to remember since the first letter of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">help</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo;. The easiest solution to this
  problem is to use <kbd>C-h</kbd> (and &lt;Backspace&gt;) for help
  and &lt;DEL&gt; (the &lt;Delete&gt; key) for deleting the
  previous character.</p>

  <p>For many people this solution may be problematic:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>They normally use &lt;Backspace&gt; outside of Emacs for
    deleting the previous character. This can be solved by making
    &lt;DEL&gt; the command for deleting the previous character
    outside of Emacs. On many Unix systems, this command will remap
    &lt;DEL&gt;:
      <pre class="example">
          stty erase `^?'
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>The user may prefer the &lt;Backspace&gt; key for deleting
    the previous character because it is more conveniently located
    on their keyboard or because they don't even have a separate
    &lt;Delete&gt; key. In this case, the &lt;Backspace&gt; key
    should be made to behave like &lt;Delete&gt;. There are several
    methods.

      <ul>
        <li>Some terminals (e.g., VT3## terminals) and terminal
        emulators (e.g., TeraTerm) allow the character generated by
        the &lt;Backspace&gt; key to be changed from a setup
        menu.</li>

        <li>You may be able to get a keyboard that is completely
        programmable, or a terminal emulator that supports
        remapping of any key to any other key.</li>

        <li>With Emacs 21.1 and later, you can control the effect
        of the &lt;Backspace&gt; and &lt;Delete&gt; keys, on both
        dumb terminals and a windowed displays, by customizing the
        option <code>normal-erase-is-backspace-mode</code>, or by
        invoking <kbd>M-x normal-erase-is-backspace</kbd>. See the
        documentation of these symbols (see <a href=
        "Emacs-Lisp-documentation.html#Emacs-Lisp-documentation">Emacs
        Lisp documentation</a>) for more info.</li>

        <li>It is possible to swap the &lt;Backspace&gt; and
        &lt;DEL&gt; keys inside Emacs:
          <pre class="lisp">
               (keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)
</pre>

          <p class="noindent">This is the recommended method of
          forcing &lt;Backspace&gt; to act as &lt;DEL&gt;, because
          it works even in modes which bind &lt;DEL&gt; to
          something other than
          <code>delete-backward-char</code>.</p>

          <p>Similarly, you could remap &lt;DEL&gt; to act as
          <kbd>C-d</kbd>, which by default deletes forward:</p>
          <pre class="lisp">
               (keyboard-translate ?\C-? ?\C-d)
</pre>

          <p>See <a href=
          "Swapping-keys.html#Swapping-keys">Swapping keys</a>, for
          further details about
          <code>keyboard-translate</code>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Another approach is to switch key bindings and put help
        on <kbd>C-x h</kbd> instead:
          <pre class="lisp">
               (global-set-key "\C-h" 'delete-backward-char)

               ;; overrides mark-whole-buffer
               (global-set-key "\C-xh" 'help-command)
</pre>

          <p class="noindent">This method is not recommended,
          though: it only solves the problem for those modes which
          bind &lt;DEL&gt; to <code>delete-backward-char</code>.
          Modes which bind &lt;DEL&gt; to something else, such as
          <code>view-mode</code>, will not work as you expect when
          you press the &lt;Backspace&gt; key. For this reason, we
          recommend the <code>keyboard-translate</code> method,
          shown above.</p>

          <p>Other popular key bindings for help are <kbd>M-?</kbd>
          and <kbd>C-x ?</kbd>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Don't try to bind &lt;DEL&gt; to
      <code>help-command</code>, because there are many modes that
      have local bindings of &lt;DEL&gt; that will interfere.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>When Emacs 21 or later runs on a windowed display, it binds
  the &lt;Delete&gt; key to a command which deletes the character
  at point, to make Emacs more consistent with keyboard operation
  on these systems.</p>

  &lt;DEL&gt; Fails to Delete</a>.</p>
