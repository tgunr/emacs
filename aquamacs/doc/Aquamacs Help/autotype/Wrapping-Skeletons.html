  <h2 class="chapter">2 Wrapping Skeletons Around Existing
  Text</h2>

  <p><a name="index-wrapping-skeletons-3" id=
  "index-wrapping-skeletons-3"></a> Often you will find yourself
  with some code that for whatever reason suddenly becomes
  conditional. Or you have written a bit of text and want to put it
  in the middle of a form letter. Skeletons provide a means for
  accomplishing this, and can even, in the case of programming
  languages, reindent the wrapped code for you.</p>

  <p>Skeleton commands take an optional numeric prefix argument
  (see <a href=
  "../emacs/Arguments.html#g_t_0028emacs_0029Arguments">(emacs)Arguments</a>).
  This is interpreted in two different ways depending on whether
  the prefix is positive, i.e. forwards oriented or negative, i.e.
  backwards oriented.</p>

  <p>A positive prefix means to wrap the skeleton around that many
  following words. This is accomplished by putting the words there
  where the point is normally left after that skeleton is inserted
  (see <a href="Using-Skeletons.html#Using-Skeletons">Using
  Skeletons</a>). The point (see <a href=
  "../emacs/Point.html#g_t_0028emacs_0029Point">(emacs)Point</a>)
  is left at the next interesting spot in the skeleton instead.</p>

  <p>A negative prefix means to do something similar with that many
  precedingly marked interregions (see <a href=
  "../emacs/Mark.html#g_t_0028emacs_0029Mark">(emacs)Mark</a>). In
  the simplest case, if you type <kbd>M--</kbd> just before issuing
  the skeleton command, that will wrap the skeleton around the
  current region, just like a positive argument would have wrapped
  it around a number of words.</p>

  <p>Smaller negative arguments will wrap that many interregions
  into successive interesting spots within the skeleton, again
  leaving the point at the next one. We speak about interregions
  rather than regions here, because we treat them in the order they
  appear in the buffer, which coincides with successive regions
  only if they were marked in order.</p>

  <p>That is, if you marked in alphabetical order the points A B C
  [] (where [] represents the point) and call a skeleton command
  with <kbd>M-- 3</kbd>, you will wrap the text from A to B into
  the first interesting spot of the skeleton, the text from B to C
  into the next one, the text from C to the point into the third
  one, and leave the point in the fourth one. If there are less
  marks in the buffer, or if the skeleton defines less interesting
  points, the surplus is ignored.</p>

  <p>If, on the other hand, you marked in alphabetical order the
  points [] A C B, and call a skeleton command with <kbd>M--
  3</kbd>, you will wrap the text from point to A, then the text
  from A to C and finally the text from C to B. This is done
  because the regions overlap and Emacs would be helplessly lost if
  it tried to follow the order in which you marked these
  points.</p>
