  The display contains several columns, some of which are optional.
  These columns are, from left to right:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Optionally, the head revision of the file. This is the
    latest version found in the repository. It might also contain
    (instead of the head revision) a sub status which typically
    gives further information about how we got to the current
    state, for example &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">patched</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">merged</span></samp>&rsquo;, <small class=
    "dots">...</small></li>

    <li>An asterisk when the file is <dfn>marked</dfn> (see
    <a href="Selected-files.html#Selected-files">Selected
    files</a>).</li>

    <li>The actual status of the file wrt the repository. See
    below.</li>

    <li>Optionally, the base revision of the file. This is the
    version which the copy in your working directory is based
    upon.</li>

    <li>The file name.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file
  status</span></samp>&rsquo; field can have the following
  values:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Modified</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      The file is modified in your working directory, and there was
      no modification to the same file in the repository. This
      status can have the following substatus:

      <dl>
        <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">merged</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>The file was modified in your working directory, and
        there were modifications in the repository as well, but
        they were merged successfully, without conflict, in your
        working directory.</dd>
      </dl><br />
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Conflict</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to
      <var>file</var> with changes from the repository.
      <var>file</var> (the copy in your working directory) is now
      the output of the <code>rcsmerge</code> command on the two
      versions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your
      working directory, with the name <samp><span class=
      "file">.#</span><var>file</var><span class=
      "file">.</span><var>version</var></samp>, where
      <var>version</var> is the RCS revision that your modified
      file started from. See <a href=
      "Viewing-differences.html#Viewing-differences">Viewing
      differences</a>, for more details.

      <p>A conflict can also come from a disagreement on the
      existence of the file rather than on its content. This case
      is indicated by the following possible substatus:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">removed</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>The file is locally removed but a new revision has been
        committed to the repository by someone else.<br /></dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">added</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>The file is locally added and has also been added to
        the repository by someone else.<br /></dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">modified</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>The file is locally modified but someone else has
        removed it from the repository.</dd>
      </dl><br />
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Added</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>The file has been added by you, but it still needs to be
    checked in to the repository.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Removed</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>The file has been removed by you, but it still needs to be
    checked in to the repository. You can resurrect it by typing
    <kbd>a</kbd> (see <a href=
    "Adding-and-removing-files.html#Adding-and-removing-files">Adding
    and removing files</a>).<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Unknown</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>A file that was detected in your directory, but that
    neither appears in the repository, nor is present on the list
    of files that CVS should ignore.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Up-to-date</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      The file is up to date with respect to the version in the
      repository. This status can have a substatus of:

      <dl>
        <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">added</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>You have just added the file to the
        repository.<br /></dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">updated</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>The file was brought up to date with respect to the
        repository. This is done for any file that exists in the
        repository but not in your source, and for files that you
        haven't changed but are not the most recent versions
        available in the repository.<br /></dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">patched</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>The file was brought up to date with respect to the
        remote repository by way of fetching and applying a patch
        to the file in your source. This is equivalent to
        &lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">updated</span></samp>&rsquo; except that CVS decided
        to use a hopefully more efficient method.<br /></dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">committed</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>You just committed the file.</dd>
      </dl><br />
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Need-Update</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>Either a newer version than the one in your source is
    available in the repository and you have not modified your
    checked out version, or the file exists in the repository but
    not in your source. Use &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">cvs-mode-update</span></samp>&rsquo; bound to
    <kbd>O</kbd> to update the file.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Need-Merge</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>You have modified the checked out version of the file, and
    a newer version is available in the repository. A merge will
    take place when you run a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">cvs-update</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">Missing</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>The file has been unexpectedly removed from your working
    directory although it has not been &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">cvs remove</span></samp>&rsquo;d.</dd>
