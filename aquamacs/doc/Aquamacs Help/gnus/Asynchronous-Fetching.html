  <h3 class="section">3.11 Asynchronous Article Fetching</h3>

  <p><a name="index-asynchronous-article-fetching-1041" id=
  "index-asynchronous-article-fetching-1041"></a><a name=
  "index-article-pre_002dfetch-1042" id=
  "index-article-pre_002dfetch-1042"></a><a name=
  "index-pre_002dfetch-1043" id="index-pre_002dfetch-1043"></a> If
  you read your news from an <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server that's
  far away, the network latencies may make reading articles a
  chore. You have to wait for a while after pressing <kbd>n</kbd>
  to go to the next article before the article appears. Why can't
  Gnus just go ahead and fetch the article while you are reading
  the previous one? Why not, indeed.</p>

  <p>First, some caveats. There are some pitfalls to using
  asynchronous article fetching, especially the way Gnus does
  it.</p>

  <p>Let's say you are reading article 1, which is short, and
  article 2 is quite long, and you are not interested in reading
  that. Gnus does not know this, so it goes ahead and fetches
  article 2. You decide to read article 3, but since Gnus is in the
  process of fetching article 2, the connection is blocked.</p>

  <p>To avoid these situations, Gnus will open two (count 'em two)
  connections to the server. Some people may think this isn't a
  very nice thing to do, but I don't see any real alternatives.
  Setting up that extra connection takes some time, so Gnus startup
  will be slower.</p>

  <p>Gnus will fetch more articles than you will read. This will
  mean that the link between your machine and the
  <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server will become more loaded than if
  you didn't use article pre-fetch. The server itself will also
  become more loaded&mdash;both with the extra article requests,
  and the extra connection.</p>

  <p>Ok, so now you know that you shouldn't really use this
  thing<small class="dots">...</small> unless you really want
  to.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dasynchronous-1044" id=
  "index-gnus_002dasynchronous-1044"></a>Here's how: Set
  <code>gnus-asynchronous</code> to <code>t</code>. The rest should
  happen automatically.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002duse_002darticle_002dprefetch-1045" id=
  "index-gnus_002duse_002darticle_002dprefetch-1045"></a>You can
  control how many articles are to be pre-fetched by setting
  <code>gnus-use-article-prefetch</code>. This is 30 by default,
  which means that when you read an article in the group, the back
  end will pre-fetch the next 30 articles. If this variable is
  <code>t</code>, the back end will pre-fetch all the articles it
  can without bound. If it is <code>nil</code>, no pre-fetching
  will be done.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dasync_002dprefetch_002darticle_002dp-1046" id=
  "index-gnus_002dasync_002dprefetch_002darticle_002dp-1046"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dasync_002dunread_002dp-1047"
  id="index-gnus_002dasync_002dunread_002dp-1047"></a>There are
  probably some articles that you don't want to
  pre-fetch&mdash;read articles, for instance. The
  <code>gnus-async-prefetch-article-p</code> variable controls
  whether an article is to be pre-fetched. This function should
  return non-<code>nil</code> when the article in question is to be
  pre-fetched. The default is <code>gnus-async-unread-p</code>,
  which returns <code>nil</code> on read articles. The function is
  called with an article data structure as the only parameter.</p>

  <p>If, for instance, you wish to pre-fetch only unread articles
  shorter than 100 lines, you could say something like:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (defun my-async-short-unread-p (data)
       "Return non-nil for short, unread articles."
       (and (gnus-data-unread-p data)
            (&lt; (mail-header-lines (gnus-data-header data))
               100)))

     (setq gnus-async-prefetch-article-p 'my-async-short-unread-p)
</pre>

  <p>These functions will be called many, many times, so they
  should preferably be short and sweet to avoid slowing down Gnus
  too much. It's probably a good idea to byte-compile things like
  this.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dasync_002dpost_002dfetch_002dfunction-1048" id=
  "index-gnus_002dasync_002dpost_002dfetch_002dfunction-1048"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dhtml_002dprefetch_002dimages-1049"
  id="index-gnus_002dhtml_002dprefetch_002dimages-1049"></a>After
  an article has been prefetched, this
  <code>gnus-async-post-fetch-function</code> will be called. The
  buffer will be narrowed to the region of the article that was
  fetched. A useful value would be
  <code>gnus-html-prefetch-images</code>, which will prefetch and
  store images referenced in the article, so that you don't have to
  wait for them to be fetched when you read the article. This is
  useful for <acronym>HTML</acronym> messages that have external
  images.</p>

  id=
  "index-gnus_002dprefetched_002darticle_002ddeletion_002dstrategy-1050">
  </a>Articles have to be removed from the asynch buffer sooner or
  later. The <code>gnus-prefetched-article-deletion-strategy</code>
  says when to remove articles. This is a list that may contain the
  following elements:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>read</code></dt>

    <dd>Remove articles when they are read.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>exit</code></dt>

    <dd>Remove articles when exiting the group.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The default value is <code>(read exit)</code>.
  <!-- @vindex gnus-use-header-prefetch -->

  <!-- If @code{gnus-use-header-prefetch} is non-@code{nil}, prefetch articles -->
   <!-- from the next group. --></p>
