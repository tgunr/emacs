  <h3 class="section">7.4 Score File Format</h3>

  <p><a name="index-score-file-format-2476" id=
  "index-score-file-format-2476"></a> A score file is an
  <code>emacs-lisp</code> file that normally contains just a single
  form. Casual users are not expected to edit these files;
  everything can be changed from the summary buffer.</p>

  <p>Anyway, if you'd like to dig into it yourself, here's an
  example:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (("from"
       ("Lars Ingebrigtsen" -10000)
       ("Per Abrahamsen")
       ("larsi\\|lmi" -50000 nil R))
      ("subject"
       ("Ding is Badd" nil 728373))
      ("xref"
       ("alt.politics" -1000 728372 s))
      ("lines"
       (2 -100 nil &lt;))
      (mark 0)
      (expunge -1000)
      (mark-and-expunge -10)
      (read-only nil)
      (orphan -10)
      (adapt t)
      (files "/hom/larsi/News/gnu.SCORE")
      (exclude-files "all.SCORE")
      (local (gnus-newsgroup-auto-expire t)
             (gnus-summary-make-false-root empty))
      (eval (ding)))
</pre>

  <p>This example demonstrates most score file elements. See
  <a href="Advanced-Scoring.html#Advanced-Scoring">Advanced
  Scoring</a>, for a different approach.</p>

  <p>Even though this looks much like Lisp code, nothing here is
  actually <code>eval</code>ed. The Lisp reader is used to read
  this form, though, so it has to be valid syntactically, if not
  semantically.</p>

  <p>Six keys are supported by this alist:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>STRING</code></dt>

    <dd>
      If the key is a string, it is the name of the header to
      perform the match on. Scoring can only be performed on these
      eight headers: <code>From</code>, <code>Subject</code>,
      <code>References</code>, <code>Message-ID</code>,
      <code>Xref</code>, <code>Lines</code>, <code>Chars</code> and
      <code>Date</code>. In addition to these headers, there are
      three strings to tell Gnus to fetch the entire article and do
      the match on larger parts of the article: <code>Body</code>
      will perform the match on the body of the article,
      <code>Head</code> will perform the match on the head of the
      article, and <code>All</code> will perform the match on the
      entire article. Note that using any of these last three keys
      will slow down group entry <em>considerably</em>. The final
      &ldquo;header&rdquo; you can score on is
      <code>Followup</code>. These score entries will result in new
      score entries being added for all follow-ups to articles that
      matches these score entries.

      <p>Following this key is an arbitrary number of score
      entries, where each score entry has one to four elements.</p>

      <ol type="1" start="1">
        <li>The first element is the <dfn>match element</dfn>. On
        most headers this will be a string, but on the Lines and
        Chars headers, this must be an integer.</li>

        <li>If the second element is present, it should be a
        number&mdash;the <dfn>score element</dfn>. This number
        should be an integer in the neginf to posinf interval. This
        number is added to the score of the article if the match is
        successful. If this element is not present, the
        <code>gnus-score-interactive-default-score</code> number
        will be used instead. This is 1000 by default.</li>

        <li>If the third element is present, it should be a
        number&mdash;the <dfn>date element</dfn>. This date says
        when the last time this score entry matched, which provides
        a mechanism for expiring the score entries. It this element
        is not present, the score entry is permanent. The date is
        represented by the number of days since December 31, 1
        BCE.</li>

        <li>If the fourth element is present, it should be a
        symbol&mdash;the <dfn>type element</dfn>. This element
        specifies what function should be used to see whether this
        score entry matches the article. What match types that can
        be used depends on what header you wish to perform the
        match on.

          <dl>
            <dt><dfn>From, Subject, References, Xref,
            Message-ID</dfn></dt>

            <dd>For most header types, there are the <code>r</code>
            and <code>R</code> (regexp), as well as <code>s</code>
            and <code>S</code> (substring) types, and
            <code>e</code> and <code>E</code> (exact match), and
            <code>w</code> (word match) types. If this element is
            not present, Gnus will assume that substring matching
            should be used. <code>R</code>, <code>S</code>, and
            <code>E</code> differ from the others in that the
            matches will be done in a case-sensitive manner. All
            these one-letter types are really just abbreviations
            for the <code>regexp</code>, <code>string</code>,
            <code>exact</code>, and <code>word</code> types, which
            you can use instead, if you feel like.<br /></dd>

            <dt><dfn>Extra</dfn></dt>

            <dd>
              Just as for the standard string overview headers, if
              you are using gnus-extra-headers, you can score on
              these headers' values. In this case, there is a 5th
              element in the score entry, being the name of the
              header to be scored. The following entry is useful in
              your <samp><span class="file">all.SCORE</span></samp>
              file in case of spam attacks from a single origin
              host, if your <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server tracks
              &lsquo;<samp><span class=
              "samp">NNTP-Posting-Host</span></samp>&rsquo; in
              overviews:
              <pre class="lisp">
                    ("111.222.333.444" -1000 nil s
                     "NNTP-Posting-Host")
</pre><br />
            </dd>

            <dt><dfn>Lines, Chars</dfn></dt>

            <dd>
              These two headers use different match types:
              <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>=</code>,
              <code>&gt;=</code> and <code>&lt;=</code>.

              <p>These predicates are true if</p>
              <pre class="example">
                    (PREDICATE HEADER MATCH)
</pre>

              <p>evaluates to non-<code>nil</code>. For instance,
              the advanced match <code>("lines" 4 &lt;)</code> (see
              <a href=
              "Advanced-Scoring.html#Advanced-Scoring">Advanced
              Scoring</a>) will result in the following form:</p>
              <pre class="lisp">
                    (&lt; header-value 4)
</pre>

              <p>Or to put it another way: When using
              <code>&lt;</code> on <code>Lines</code> with 4 as the
              match, we get the score added if the article has less
              than 4 lines. (It's easy to get confused and think
              it's the other way around. But it's not. I
              think.)</p>

              <p>When matching on <code>Lines</code>, be careful
              because some back ends (like <code>nndir</code>) do
              not generate <code>Lines</code> header, so every
              article ends up being marked as having 0 lines. This
              can lead to strange results if you happen to lower
              score of the articles with few lines.<br /></p>
            </dd>

            <dt><dfn>Date</dfn></dt>

            <dd>
              For the Date header we have three kinda silly match
              types: <code>before</code>, <code>at</code> and
              <code>after</code>. I can't really imagine this ever
              being useful, but, like, it would feel kinda silly
              not to provide this function. Just in case. You never
              know. Better safe than sorry. Once burnt, twice shy.
              Don't judge a book by its cover. Never not have sex
              on a first date. (I have been told that at least one
              person, and I quote, &ldquo;found this function
              indispensable&rdquo;, however.)

              <p><a name="index-ISO8601-2477" id=
              "index-ISO8601-2477"></a><a name="index-date-2478"
              id="index-date-2478"></a>A more useful match type is
              <code>regexp</code>. With it, you can match the date
              string using a regular expression. The date is
              normalized to ISO8601 compact format
              first&mdash;<var>YYYYMMDD</var><code>T</code><var>HHMMSS</var>.
              If you want to match all articles that have been
              posted on April 1st in every year, you could use
              &lsquo;<samp><span class=
              "samp">....0401.........</span></samp>&rsquo; as a
              match string, for instance. (Note that the date is
              kept in its original time zone, so this will match
              articles that were posted when it was April 1st where
              the article was posted from. Time zones are such
              wholesome fun for the whole family, eh?)<br /></p>
            </dd>

            <dt><dfn>Head, Body, All</dfn></dt>

            <dd>These three match keys use the same match types as
            the <code>From</code> (etc) header uses.<br /></dd>

            <dt><dfn>Followup</dfn></dt>

            <dd>This match key is somewhat special, in that it will
            match the <code>From</code> header, and affect the
            score of not only the matching articles, but also all
            followups to the matching articles. This allows you
            e.g. increase the score of followups to your own
            articles, or decrease the score of followups to the
            articles of some known trouble-maker. Uses the same
            match types as the <code>From</code> header uses.
            (Using this match key will lead to creation of
            <samp><span class="file">ADAPT</span></samp>
            files.)<br /></dd>

            <dt><dfn>Thread</dfn></dt>

            <dd>This match key works along the same lines as the
            <code>Followup</code> match key. If you say that you
            want to score on a (sub-)thread started by an article
            with a <code>Message-ID</code> <var>x</var>, then you
            add a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
            "samp">thread</span></samp>&rsquo; match. This will add
            a new &lsquo;<samp><span class=
            "samp">thread</span></samp>&rsquo; match for each
            article that has <var>x</var> in its
            <code>References</code> header. (These new
            &lsquo;<samp><span class=
            "samp">thread</span></samp>&rsquo; matches will use the
            <code>Message-ID</code>s of these matching articles.)
            This will ensure that you can raise/lower the score of
            an entire thread, even though some articles in the
            thread may not have complete <code>References</code>
            headers. Note that using this may lead to
            undeterministic scores of the articles in the thread.
            (Using this match key will lead to creation of
            <samp><span class="file">ADAPT</span></samp>
            files.)</dd>

    read.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>expunge</code></dt>

    <dd>The value of this entry should be a number. Any articles

    <dt><code>mark-and-expunge</code></dt>

    <dd>The value of this entry should be a number. Any articles

    removed from the summary buffer.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>thread-mark-and-expunge</code></dt>

    <dd>The value of this entry should be a number. All articles
    that belong to a thread that has a total score below this
    number will be marked as read and removed from the summary
    buffer. <code>gnus-thread-score-function</code> says how to
    compute the total score for a thread.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>files</code></dt>

    <dd>The value of this entry should be any number of file names.
    These files are assumed to be score files as well, and will be
    loaded the same way this one was.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>exclude-files</code></dt>

    <dd>The clue of this entry should be any number of files. These
    files will not be loaded, even though they would normally be
    so, for some reason or other.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>eval</code></dt>

    <dd>The value of this entry will be <code>eval</code>ed. This
    element will be ignored when handling global score
    files.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>read-only</code></dt>

    <dd>Read-only score files will not be updated or saved. Global
    score files should feature this atom (see <a href=
    "Global-Score-Files.html#Global-Score-Files">Global Score
    Files</a>). (Note: <dfn>Global</dfn> here really means
    <dfn>global</dfn>; not your personal apply-to-all-groups score
    files.)<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>orphan</code></dt>

    <dd>
      The value of this entry should be a number. Articles that do
      not have parents will get this number added to their scores.
      Imagine you follow some high-volume newsgroup, like
      &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">comp.lang.c</span></samp>&rsquo;. Most likely you will
      only follow a few of the threads, also want to see any new
      threads.

      <p>You can do this with the following two score file
      entries:</p>
      <pre class="example">
                  (orphan -500)
                  (mark-and-expunge -100)
</pre>

      <p>When you enter the group the first time, you will only see
      the new threads. You then raise the score of the threads that
      you find interesting (with <kbd>I T</kbd> or <kbd>I S</kbd>),
      and ignore (<kbd>c y</kbd>) the rest. Next time you enter the
      group, you will see new articles in the interesting threads,
      plus any new threads.</p>

      <p>I.e.&mdash;the orphan score atom is for high-volume groups
      where a few interesting threads which can't be found
      automatically by ordinary scoring rules exist.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>adapt</code></dt>

    <dd>This entry controls the adaptive scoring. If it is
    <code>t</code>, the default adaptive scoring rules will be
    used. If it is <code>ignore</code>, no adaptive scoring will be
    performed on this group. If it is a list, this list will be
    used as the adaptive scoring rules. If it isn't present, or is
    something other than <code>t</code> or <code>ignore</code>, the
    default adaptive scoring rules will be used. If you want to use
    adaptive scoring on most groups, you'd set
    <code>gnus-use-adaptive-scoring</code> to <code>t</code>, and
    insert an <code>(adapt ignore)</code> in the groups where you
    do not want adaptive scoring. If you only want adaptive scoring
    in a few groups, you'd set
    <code>gnus-use-adaptive-scoring</code> to <code>nil</code>, and
    insert <code>(adapt t)</code> in the score files of the groups
    where you want it.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>adapt-file</code></dt>

    <dd>All adaptive score entries will go to the file named by
    this entry. It will also be applied when entering the group.
    This atom might be handy if you want to adapt on several groups
    at once, using the same adaptive file for a number of
    groups.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>local</code></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-local-variables-2480" id=
    "index-local-variables-2480"></a>The value of this entry should
    be a list of <code>(</code><var>var</var>
    <var>value</var><code>)</code> pairs. Each <var>var</var> will
    be made buffer-local to the current summary buffer, and set to
    the value specified. This is a convenient, if somewhat strange,
    way of setting variables in some groups if you don't like hooks
    much. Note that the <var>value</var> won't be evaluated.</dd>
