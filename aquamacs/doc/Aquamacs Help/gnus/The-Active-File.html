  <h3 class="section">1.8 The Active File</h3>

  <p><a name="index-active-file-61" id=
  "index-active-file-61"></a><a name="index-ignored-groups-62" id=
  "index-ignored-groups-62"></a> When Gnus starts, or indeed
  whenever it tries to determine whether new articles have arrived,
  it reads the active file. This is a very large file that lists
  all the active groups and articles on the server.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dignored_002dnewsgroups-63" id=
  "index-gnus_002dignored_002dnewsgroups-63"></a>Before examining
  the active file, Gnus deletes all lines that match the regexp
  <code>gnus-ignored-newsgroups</code>. This is done primarily to
  reject any groups with bogus names, but you can use this variable
  to make Gnus ignore hierarchies you aren't ever interested in.
  However, this is not recommended. In fact, it's highly
  discouraged. Instead, see <a href=
  "New-Groups.html#New-Groups">New Groups</a> for an overview of
  other variables that can be used instead.
  <!-- This variable is -->

  <!-- @code{nil} by default, and will slow down active file handling somewhat -->
   <!-- if you set it to anything else. --></p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dread_002dactive_002dfile-64" id=
  "index-gnus_002dread_002dactive_002dfile-64"></a><!-- @head -->
   The active file can be rather Huge, so if you have a slow
  network, you can set <code>gnus-read-active-file</code> to
  <code>nil</code> to prevent Gnus from reading the active file.
  This variable is <code>some</code> by default.</p>

  <p>Gnus will try to make do by getting information just on the
  groups that you actually subscribe to.</p>

  <p>Note that if you subscribe to lots and lots of groups, setting
  this variable to <code>nil</code> will probably make Gnus slower,
  not faster. At present, having this variable <code>nil</code>
  will slow Gnus down considerably, unless you read news over a
  2400 baud modem.</p>

  <p>This variable can also have the value <code>some</code>. Gnus
  will then attempt to read active info only on the subscribed
  groups. On some servers this is quite fast (on sparkling, brand
  new INN servers that support the <code>LIST ACTIVE group</code>
  command), on others this isn't fast at all. In any case,
  <code>some</code> should be faster than <code>nil</code>, and is
  certainly faster than <code>t</code> over slow lines.</p>

  <p>Some news servers (old versions of Leafnode and old versions
  of INN, for instance) do not support the <code>LIST ACTIVE
  group</code>. For these servers, <code>nil</code> is probably the
  most efficient value for this variable.</p>

  <p>If this variable is <code>nil</code>, Gnus will ask for group
  info in total lock-step, which isn't very fast. If it is
  <code>some</code> and you use an <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server,
  Gnus will pump out commands as fast as it can, and read all the
  replies in one swoop. This will normally result in better
  performance, but if the server does not support the
  aforementioned <code>LIST ACTIVE group</code> command, this isn't
  very nice to the server.</p>

  <p>If you think that starting up Gnus takes too long, try all the
  three different values for this variable and see what works best
  for you.</p>

  <p>In any case, if you use <code>some</code> or <code>nil</code>,
  you should definitely kill all groups that you aren't interested
  in to speed things up.</p>

  <p>Note that this variable also affects active file retrieval
  from secondary select methods.</p>
