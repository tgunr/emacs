  <dl>
    <dt><code>gnus-fetch-old-headers</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-gnus_002dfetch_002dold_002dheaders-962" id=
      "index-gnus_002dfetch_002dold_002dheaders-962"></a>If
      non-<code>nil</code>, Gnus will attempt to build old threads
      by fetching more old headers&mdash;headers to articles marked
      as read. If you would like to display as few summary lines as
      possible, but still connect as many loose threads as
      possible, you should set this variable to <code>some</code>
      or a number. If you set it to a number, no more than that
      number of extra old headers will be fetched. In either case,
      fetching old headers only works if the back end you are using
      carries overview files&mdash;this would normally be
      <code>nntp</code>, <code>nnspool</code>, <code>nnml</code>,
      and <code>nnmaildir</code>. Also remember that if the root of
      the thread has been expired by the server, there's not much
      Gnus can do about that.

      <p>This variable can also be set to <code>invisible</code>.
      This won't have any visible effects, but is useful if you use
      the <kbd>A T</kbd> command a lot (see <a href=
      "Finding-the-Parent.html#Finding-the-Parent">Finding the
      Parent</a>).</p>

      <p>The server has to support <acronym>NOV</acronym> for any
      of this to work.</p>

      <p><a name=
      "index-Gmane_002c-gnus_002dfetch_002dold_002dheaders-963" id=
      "index-Gmane_002c-gnus_002dfetch_002dold_002dheaders-963"></a>This
      feature can seriously impact performance it ignores all
      locally cached header entries. Setting it to <code>t</code>
      for groups for a server that doesn't expire articles (such as
      news.gmane.org), leads to very slow summary
      generation.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>gnus-fetch-old-ephemeral-headers</code></dt>

    <dd><a name=
    "index-gnus_002dfetch_002dold_002dephemeral_002dheaders-964"
    id="index-gnus_002dfetch_002dold_002dephemeral_002dheaders-964">
    </a>Same as <code>gnus-fetch-old-headers</code>, but only used
    for ephemeral newsgroups.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>gnus-build-sparse-threads</code></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-gnus_002dbuild_002dsparse_002dthreads-965"
    id=
    "index-gnus_002dbuild_002dsparse_002dthreads-965"></a>Fetching
    old headers can be slow. A low-rent similar effect can be
    gotten by setting this variable to <code>some</code>. Gnus will
    then look at the complete <code>References</code> headers of
    all articles and try to string together articles that belong in
    the same thread. This will leave <dfn>gaps</dfn> in the
    threading display where Gnus guesses that an article is missing
    from the thread. (These gaps appear like normal summary lines.
    If you select a gap, Gnus will try to fetch the article in
    question.) If this variable is <code>t</code>, Gnus will
    display all these &ldquo;gaps&rdquo; without regard for whether
    they are useful for completing the thread or not. Finally, if
    this variable is <code>more</code>, Gnus won't cut off sparse
    leaf nodes that don't lead anywhere. This variable is
    <code>nil</code> by default.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>gnus-read-all-available-headers</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name=
      "index-gnus_002dread_002dall_002davailable_002dheaders-966"
      id=
      "index-gnus_002dread_002dall_002davailable_002dheaders-966"></a>This
      is a rather obscure variable that few will find useful. It's
      intended for those non-news newsgroups where the back end has
      to fetch quite a lot to present the summary buffer, and where
      it's impossible to go back to parents of articles. This is
      mostly the case in the web-based groups.

      <p>If you don't use those, then it's safe to leave this as
      the default <code>nil</code>. If you want to use this
      variable, it should be a regexp that matches the group name,
      or <code>t</code> for all groups.</p>
