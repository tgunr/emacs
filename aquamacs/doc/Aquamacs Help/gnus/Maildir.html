  <h5 class="subsubsection">6.4.13.5 Maildir</h5>

  <p><a name="index-nnmaildir-2202" id=
  "index-nnmaildir-2202"></a><a name="index-maildir-2203" id=
  "index-maildir-2203"></a> <code>nnmaildir</code> stores mail in
  the maildir format, with each maildir corresponding to a group in
  Gnus. This format is documented here: <a href=
  "http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html">http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html</a>
  and here: <a href=
  "http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/maildir.html">http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/maildir.html</a>.
  <code>nnmaildir</code> also stores extra information in the
  <samp><span class="file">.nnmaildir/</span></samp> directory
  within a maildir.</p>

  <p>Maildir format was designed to allow concurrent deliveries and
  reading, without needing locks. With other back ends, you would
  have your mail delivered to a spool of some kind, and then you
  would configure Gnus to split mail from that spool into your
  groups. You can still do that with <code>nnmaildir</code>, but
  the more common configuration is to have your mail delivered
  directly to the maildirs that appear as group in Gnus.</p>

  <p><code>nnmaildir</code> is designed to be perfectly reliable:
  <kbd>C-g</kbd> will never corrupt its data in memory, and
  <code>SIGKILL</code> will never corrupt its data in the
  filesystem.</p>

  <p><code>nnmaildir</code> stores article marks and
  <acronym>NOV</acronym> data in each maildir. So you can copy a
  whole maildir from one Gnus setup to another, and you will keep
  your marks.</p>

  <p>Virtual server settings:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>directory</code></dt>

    <dd>
      For each of your <code>nnmaildir</code> servers (it's very
      unlikely that you'd need more than one), you need to create a
      directory and populate it with maildirs or symlinks to
      maildirs (and nothing else; do not choose a directory already
      used for other purposes). Each maildir will be represented in
      Gnus as a newsgroup on that server; the filename of the
      symlink will be the name of the group. Any filenames in the
      directory starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; are ignored. The directory is
      scanned when you first start Gnus, and each time you type
      <kbd>g</kbd> in the group buffer; if any maildirs have been
      removed or added, <code>nnmaildir</code> notices at these
      times.

      <p>The value of the <code>directory</code> parameter should
      be a Lisp form which is processed by <code>eval</code> and
      <code>expand-file-name</code> to get the path of the
      directory for this server. The form is <code>eval</code>ed
      only when the server is opened; the resulting string is used
      until the server is closed. (If you don't know about forms
      and <code>eval</code>, don't worry&mdash;a simple string will
      work.) This parameter is not optional; you must specify it. I
      don't recommend using <code>"~/Mail"</code> or a subdirectory
      of it; several other parts of Gnus use that directory by
      default for various things, and may get confused if
      <code>nnmaildir</code> uses it too.
      <code>"~/.nnmaildir"</code> is a typical value.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>target-prefix</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This should be a Lisp form which is processed by
      <code>eval</code> and <code>expand-file-name</code>. The form
      is <code>eval</code>ed only when the server is opened; the
      resulting string is used until the server is closed.

      <p>When you create a group on an <code>nnmaildir</code>
      server, the maildir is created with
      <code>target-prefix</code> prepended to its name, and a
      symlink pointing to that maildir is created, named with the
      plain group name. So if <code>directory</code> is
      <code>"~/.nnmaildir"</code> and <code>target-prefix</code> is
      <code>"../maildirs/"</code>, then when you create the group
      <code>foo</code>, <code>nnmaildir</code> will create
      <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.nnmaildir/../maildirs/foo</span></samp> as a
      maildir, and will create <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.nnmaildir/foo</span></samp> as a symlink pointing
      to <samp><span class=
      "file">../maildirs/foo</span></samp>.</p>

      <p>You can set <code>target-prefix</code> to a string without
      any slashes to create both maildirs and symlinks in the same
      <code>directory</code>; in this case, any maildirs found in
      <code>directory</code> whose names start with
      <code>target-prefix</code> will not be listed as groups (but
      the symlinks pointing to them will be).</p>

      <p>As a special case, if <code>target-prefix</code> is
      <code>""</code> (the default), then when you create a group,
      the maildir will be created in <code>directory</code> without
      a corresponding symlink. Beware that you cannot use
      <code>gnus-group-delete-group</code> on such groups without
      the <code>force</code> argument.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>directory-files</code></dt>

    <dd>This should be a function with the same interface as
    <code>directory-files</code> (such as
    <code>directory-files</code> itself). It is used to scan the
    server's <code>directory</code> for maildirs. This parameter is
    optional; the default is
    <code>nnheader-directory-files-safe</code> if
    <code>nnheader-directory-files-is-safe</code> is
    <code>nil</code>, and <code>directory-files</code> otherwise.
    (<code>nnheader-directory-files-is-safe</code> is checked only
    once when the server is opened; if you want to check it each
    time the directory is scanned, you'll have to provide your own
    function that does that.)<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>get-new-mail</code></dt>

    <dd>
      If non-<code>nil</code>, then after scanning for new mail in
      the group maildirs themselves as usual, this server will also
      incorporate mail the conventional Gnus way, from
      <code>mail-sources</code> according to
      <code>nnmail-split-methods</code> or
      <code>nnmail-split-fancy</code>. The default value is
      <code>nil</code>.

      <p>Do <em>not</em> use the same maildir both in
      <code>mail-sources</code> and as an <code>nnmaildir</code>
      group. The results might happen to be useful, but that would
      be by chance, not by design, and the results might be
      different in the future. If your split rules create new
      groups, remember to supply a <code>create-directory</code>
      server parameter.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h5 class="subsubsection">6.4.13.6 Group parameters</h5>

  <p><code>nnmaildir</code> uses several group parameters. It's
  safe to ignore all this; the default behavior for
  <code>nnmaildir</code> is the same as the default behavior for
  other mail back ends: articles are deleted after one week, etc.
  Except for the expiry parameters, all this functionality is
  unique to <code>nnmaildir</code>, so you can ignore it if you're
  just trying to duplicate the behavior you already have with
  another back end.</p>

  <p>If the value of any of these parameters is a vector, the first
  element is evaluated as a Lisp form and the result is used,
  rather than the original value. If the value is not a vector, the
  value itself is evaluated as a Lisp form. (This is why these
  parameters use names different from those of other, similar
  parameters supported by other back ends: they have different,
  though similar, meanings.) (For numbers, strings,
  <code>nil</code>, and <code>t</code>, you can ignore the
  <code>eval</code> business again; for other values, remember to
  use an extra quote and wrap the value in a vector when
  appropriate.)</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>expire-age</code></dt>

    <dd>An integer specifying the minimum age, in seconds, of an
    article before it will be expired, or the symbol
    <code>never</code> to specify that articles should never be
    expired. If this parameter is not set, <code>nnmaildir</code>
    falls back to the usual
    <code>nnmail-expiry-wait</code>(<code>-function</code>)
    variables (the <code>expiry-wait</code> group parameter
    overrides <code>nnmail-expiry-wait</code> and makes
    <code>nnmail-expiry-wait-function</code> ineffective). If you
    wanted a value of 3 days, you could use something like
    <code>[(* 3 24 60 60)]</code>; <code>nnmaildir</code> will
    evaluate the form and use the result. An article's age is
    measured starting from the article file's modification time.
    Normally, this is the same as the article's delivery time, but
    editing an article makes it younger. Moving an article (other
    than via expiry) may also make an article younger.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>expire-group</code></dt>

    <dd>
      If this is set to a string such as a full Gnus group name,
      like
      <pre class="example">
          "backend+server.address.string:group.name"
</pre>

      <p>and if it is not the name of the same group that the
      parameter belongs to, then articles will be moved to the
      specified group during expiry before being deleted. <em>If
      this is set to an</em> <code>nnmaildir</code><em>group, the
      article will be just as old in the destination group as it
      was in the source group.</em> So be careful with
      <code>expire-age</code> in the destination group. If this is
      set to the name of the same group that the parameter belongs
      to, then the article is not expired at all. If you use the
      vector form, the first element is evaluated once for each
      article. So that form can refer to
      <code>nnmaildir-article-file-name</code>, etc., to decide
      where to put the article. <em>Even if this parameter is not
      set,</em> <code>nnmaildir</code><em>does not fall back to
      the</em> <code>expiry-target</code> <em>group parameter or
      the</em> <code>nnmail-expiry-target</code>
      <em>variable.</em><br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>read-only</code></dt>

    <dd>If this is set to <code>t</code>, <code>nnmaildir</code>
    will treat the articles in this maildir as read-only. This
    means: articles are not renamed from <samp><span class=
    "file">new/</span></samp> into <samp><span class=
    "file">cur/</span></samp>; articles are only found in
    <samp><span class="file">new/</span></samp>, not
    <samp><span class="file">cur/</span></samp>; articles are never
    deleted; articles cannot be edited. <samp><span class=
    "file">new/</span></samp> is expected to be a symlink to the
    <samp><span class="file">new/</span></samp> directory of
    another maildir&mdash;e.g., a system-wide mailbox containing a
    mailing list of common interest. Everything in the maildir
    outside <samp><span class="file">new/</span></samp> is
    <em>not</em> treated as read-only, so for a shared mailbox, you
    do still need to set up your own maildir (or have write
    permission to the shared mailbox); your maildir just won't
    contain extra copies of the articles.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>directory-files</code></dt>

    <dd>A function with the same interface as
    <code>directory-files</code>. It is used to scan the
    directories in the maildir corresponding to this group to find
    articles. The default is the function specified by the server's
    <code>directory-files</code> parameter.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>distrust-Lines:</code></dt>

    <dd>If non-<code>nil</code>, <code>nnmaildir</code> will always
    count the lines of an article, rather than use the
    <code>Lines:</code> header field. If <code>nil</code>, the
    header field will be used if present.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>always-marks</code></dt>

    <dd>A list of mark symbols, such as <code>['(read
    expire)]</code>. Whenever Gnus asks <code>nnmaildir</code> for
    article marks, <code>nnmaildir</code> will say that all
    articles have these marks, regardless of whether the marks
    stored in the filesystem say so. This is a proof-of-concept
    feature that will probably be removed eventually; it ought to
    be done in Gnus proper, or abandoned if it's not
    worthwhile.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>never-marks</code></dt>

    <dd>A list of mark symbols, such as <code>['(tick
    expire)]</code>. Whenever Gnus asks <code>nnmaildir</code> for
    article marks, <code>nnmaildir</code> will say that no articles
    have these marks, regardless of whether the marks stored in the
    filesystem say so. <code>never-marks</code> overrides
    <code>always-marks</code>. This is a proof-of-concept feature
    that will probably be removed eventually; it ought to be done
    in Gnus proper, or abandoned if it's not worthwhile.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>nov-cache-size</code></dt>

    <dd>An integer specifying the size of the
    <acronym>NOV</acronym> memory cache. To speed things up,
    <code>nnmaildir</code> keeps <acronym>NOV</acronym> data in
    memory for a limited number of articles in each group. (This is
    probably not worthwhile, and will probably be removed in the
    future.) This parameter's value is noticed only the first time
    a group is seen after the server is opened&mdash;i.e., when you
    first start Gnus, typically. The <acronym>NOV</acronym> cache
    is never resized until the server is closed and reopened. The
    default is an estimate of the number of articles that would be
    displayed in the summary buffer: a count of articles that are
    either marked with <code>tick</code> or not marked with
    <code>read</code>, plus a little extra.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h5 class="subsubsection">6.4.13.7 Article identification</h5>

  <p>Articles are stored in the <samp><span class=
  "file">cur/</span></samp> subdirectory of each maildir. Each
  article file is named like <code>uniq:info</code>, where
  <code>uniq</code> contains no colons. <code>nnmaildir</code>
  ignores, but preserves, the <code>:info</code> part. (Other
  maildir readers typically use this part of the filename to store
  marks.) The <code>uniq</code> part uniquely identifies the
  article, and is used in various places in the <samp><span class=
  "file">.nnmaildir/</span></samp> subdirectory of the maildir to
  store information about the corresponding article. The full
  pathname of an article is available in the variable
  <code>nnmaildir-article-file-name</code> after you request the
  article in the summary buffer.</p>

  <h5 class="subsubsection">6.4.13.8 NOV data</h5>

  <p>An article identified by <code>uniq</code> has its
  <acronym>NOV</acronym> data (used to generate lines in the
  summary buffer) stored in <code>.nnmaildir/nov/uniq</code>. There
  is no <code>nnmaildir-generate-nov-databases</code> function.
  (There isn't much need for it&mdash;an article's
  <acronym>NOV</acronym> data is updated automatically when the
  article or <code>nnmail-extra-headers</code> has changed.) You
  can force <code>nnmaildir</code> to regenerate the
  <acronym>NOV</acronym> data for a single article simply by
  deleting the corresponding <acronym>NOV</acronym> file, but
  <em>beware</em>: this will also cause <code>nnmaildir</code> to
  assign a new article number for this article, which may cause
  trouble with <code>seen</code> marks, the Agent, and the
  cache.</p>

  <h5 class="subsubsection">6.4.13.9 Article marks</h5>

  <p>An article identified by <code>uniq</code> is considered to
  have the mark <code>flag</code> when the file <samp><span class=
  "file">.nnmaildir/marks/flag/uniq</span></samp> exists. When Gnus
  asks <code>nnmaildir</code> for a group's marks,
  <code>nnmaildir</code> looks for such files and reports the set
  of marks it finds. When Gnus asks <code>nnmaildir</code> to store
  a new set of marks, <code>nnmaildir</code> creates and deletes
  the corresponding files as needed. (Actually, rather than create
  a new file for each mark, it just creates hard links to
  <samp><span class="file">.nnmaildir/markfile</span></samp>, to
  save inodes.)</p>

  <p>You can invent new marks by creating a new directory in
  <samp><span class="file">.nnmaildir/marks/</span></samp>. You can
  tar up a maildir and remove it from your server, untar it later,
  and keep your marks. You can add and remove marks yourself by
  creating and deleting mark files. If you do this while Gnus is
  running and your <code>nnmaildir</code> server is open, it's best
  to exit all summary buffers for <code>nnmaildir</code> groups and
  type <kbd>s</kbd> in the group buffer first, and to type
  <kbd>g</kbd> or <kbd>M-g</kbd> in the group buffer afterwards.
  Otherwise, Gnus might not pick up the changes, and might undo
  them.</p>
