  <h4 class="subsection">8.2.7 Propagating marks</h4>

  <p>First of: you really need a patched mairix binary for using
  the marks propagation feature efficiently. Otherwise, you would
  have to update the mairix database all the time. You can get the
  patch at</p>

  <p><a href=
  "http://www.randomsample.de/mairix-maildir-patch.tar">http://www.randomsample.de/mairix-maildir-patch.tar</a></p>

  <p>You need the mairix v0.21 source code for this patch;
  everything else is explained in the accompanied readme file. If
  you don't want to use marks propagation, you don't have to apply
  these patches, but they also fix some annoyances regarding
  changing maildir flags, so it might still be useful to you.</p>

  <p>With the patched mairix binary, you can use
  <code>nnmairix</code> as an alternative to mail splitting (see
  <a href="Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy
  Mail Splitting</a>). For example, instead of splitting all mails
  from &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">david@foobar.com</span></samp>&rsquo; into a group, you
  can simply create a search group with the query
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f:david@foobar.com</span></samp>&rsquo;. This is actually
  what &ldquo;smart folders&rdquo; are all about: simply put
  everything in one mail folder and dynamically create searches
  instead of splitting. This is more flexible, since you can
  dynamically change your folders any time you want to. This also
  implies that you will usually read your mails in the
  <code>nnmairix</code> groups instead of your &ldquo;real&rdquo;
  mail groups.</p>

  <p>There is one problem, though: say you got a new mail from
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">david@foobar.com</span></samp>&rsquo;; it will now show up
  in two groups, the &ldquo;real&rdquo; group (your INBOX, for
  example) and in the <code>nnmairix</code> search group (provided
  you have updated the mairix database). Now you enter the
  <code>nnmairix</code> group and read the mail. The mail will be
  marked as read, but only in the <code>nnmairix</code>
  group&mdash;in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; mail group it will be still
  shown as unread.</p>

  <p>You could now catch up the mail group (see <a href=
  "Group-Data.html#Group-Data">Group Data</a>), but this is tedious
  and error prone, since you may overlook mails you don't have
  created <code>nnmairix</code> groups for. Of course, you could
  first use <code>nnmairix-goto-original-article</code> (see
  <a href=
  "nnmairix-keyboard-shortcuts.html#nnmairix-keyboard-shortcuts">nnmairix
  keyboard shortcuts</a>) and then read the mail in the original
  group, but that's even more cumbersome.</p>

  <p>Clearly, the easiest way would be if marks could somehow be
  automatically set for the original article. This is exactly what
  <em>marks propagation</em> is about.</p>

  <p>Marks propagation is deactivated by default. You can activate
  it for a certain <code>nnmairix</code> group with
  <code>nnmairix-group-toggle-propmarks-this-group</code> (bound to
  <kbd>G b p</kbd>). This function will warn you if you try to use
  it with your default search group; the reason is that the default
  search group is used for temporary searches, and it's easy to
  accidentally propagate marks from this group. However, you can
  ignore this warning if you really want to.</p>

  <p>With marks propagation enabled, all the marks you set in a
  <code>nnmairix</code> group should now be propagated to the
  original article. For example, you can now tick an article (by
  default with <kbd>!</kbd>) and this mark should magically be set
  for the original article, too.</p>

  <p>A few more remarks which you may or may not want to know:</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-nnmairix_002dpropagate_002dmarks_002dupon_002dclose-2586"
  id=
  "index-nnmairix_002dpropagate_002dmarks_002dupon_002dclose-2586"></a>Marks
  will not be set immediately, but only upon closing a group. This
  not only makes marks propagation faster, it also avoids problems
  with dangling symlinks when dealing with maildir files (since
  changing flags will change the file name). You can also control
  when to propagate marks via
  <code>nnmairix-propagate-marks-upon-close</code> (see the
  doc-string for details).</p>

  <p>Obviously, <code>nnmairix</code> will have to look up the
  original group for every article you want to set marks for. If
  available, <code>nnmairix</code> will first use the registry for
  determining the original group. The registry is very fast, hence
  you should really, really enable the registry when using marks
  propagation. If you don't have to worry about RAM and disc space,
  set <code>gnus-registry-max-entries</code> to a large enough
  value; to be on the safe side, choose roughly the amount of mails
  you index with mairix.</p>

  <p><a name="index-nnmairix_002donly_002duse_002dregistry-2587"
  id="index-nnmairix_002donly_002duse_002dregistry-2587"></a>If you
  don't want to use the registry or the registry hasn't seen the
  original article yet, <code>nnmairix</code> will use an
  additional mairix search for determining the file name of the
  article. This, of course, is way slower than the
  registry&mdash;if you set hundreds or even thousands of marks
  this way, it might take some time. You can avoid this situation
  by setting <code>nnmairix-only-use-registry</code> to t.</p>

  <p>Maybe you also want to propagate marks the other way round,
  i.e. if you tick an article in a "real" mail group, you'd like to
  have the same article in a <code>nnmairix</code> group ticked,
  too. For several good reasons, this can only be done efficiently
  if you use maildir. To immediately contradict myself, let me
  mention that it WON'T work with <code>nnmaildir</code>, since
  <code>nnmaildir</code> stores the marks externally and not in the
  file name. Therefore, propagating marks to <code>nnmairix</code>
  groups will usually only work if you use an IMAP server which
  uses maildir as its file format.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-nnmairix_002dpropagate_002dmarks_002dto_002dnnmairix_002dgroups-2588"
  id=
  "index-nnmairix_002dpropagate_002dmarks_002dto_002dnnmairix_002dgroups-2588">
  </a>If you work with this setup, just set
  <code>nnmairix-propagate-marks-to-nnmairix-groups</code> to
  <code>t</code> and see what happens. If you don't like what you
  see, just set it to <code>nil</code> again. One problem might be
  that you get a wrong number of unread articles; this usually
  happens when you delete or expire articles in the original
  groups. When this happens, you can recreate the
  <code>nnmairix</code> group on the back end using <kbd>G b
  d</kbd>.</p>
