  <h3 class="section">6.5 Browsing the Web</h3>

  <p><a name="index-web-2224" id="index-web-2224"></a><a name=
  "index-browsing-the-web-2225" id=
  "index-browsing-the-web-2225"></a><a name="index-www-2226" id=
  "index-www-2226"></a><a name="index-http-2227" id=
  "index-http-2227"></a> Web-based discussion forums are getting
  more and more popular. On many subjects, the web-based forums
  have become the most important forums, eclipsing the importance
  of mailing lists and news groups. The reason is easy to
  understand&mdash;they are friendly to new users; you just point
  and click, and there's the discussion. With mailing lists, you
  have to go through a cumbersome subscription procedure, and most
  people don't even know what a news group is.</p>

  <p>The problem with this scenario is that web browsers are not
  very good at being newsreaders. They do not keep track of what
  articles you've read; they do not allow you to score on subjects
  you're interested in; they do not allow off-line browsing; they
  require you to click around and drive you mad in the end.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;if web browsers suck at reading discussion forums,
  why not use Gnus to do it instead?</p>

  <p>Gnus has been getting a bit of a collection of back ends for
  providing interfaces to these sources.</p>

  <ul class="menu">
    <li><a accesskey="1" href=
    "Archiving-Mail.html#Archiving-Mail">Archiving Mail</a></li>

    <li><a accesskey="2" href="Web-Searches.html#Web-Searches">Web
    Searches</a>: Creating groups from articles that match a
    string.</li>

    <li><a accesskey="3" href="RSS.html#RSS">RSS</a>: Reading RDF
    site summary.</li>

    <li><a accesskey="4" href=
    "Customizing-W3.html#Customizing-W3">Customizing W3</a>: Doing
    stuff to Emacs/W3 from Gnus.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All the web sources require Emacs/W3 and the url library or
  those alternatives to work.</p>

  <p>The main caveat with all these web sources is that they
  probably won't work for a very long time. Gleaning information
  from the <acronym>HTML</acronym> data is guesswork at best, and
  when the layout is altered, the Gnus back end will fail. If you
  have reasonably new versions of these back ends, though, you
  should be ok.</p>

  <p>One thing all these Web methods have in common is that the Web
  sources are often down, unavailable or just plain too slow to be
  fun. In those cases, it makes a lot of sense to let the Gnus
  Agent (see <a href="Gnus-Unplugged.html#Gnus-Unplugged">Gnus
  Unplugged</a>) handle downloading articles, and then you can read
  them at leisure from your local disk. No more World Wide Wait for
  you.</p>
