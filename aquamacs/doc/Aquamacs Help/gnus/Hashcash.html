  <h4 class="subsection">9.17.4 Hashcash</h4>

  <p><a name="index-hashcash-2723" id="index-hashcash-2723"></a> A
  novel technique to fight spam is to require senders to do
  something costly and demonstrably unique for each message they
  send. This has the obvious drawback that you cannot rely on
  everyone in the world using this technique, since it is not part
  of the Internet standards, but it may be useful in smaller
  communities.</p>

  <p>While the tools in the previous section work well in practice,
  they work only because the tools are constantly maintained and
  updated as new form of spam appears. This means that a small
  percentage of spam will always get through. It also means that
  somewhere, someone needs to read lots of spam to update these
  tools. Hashcash avoids that, but instead prefers that everyone
  you contact through e-mail supports the scheme. You can view the
  two approaches as pragmatic vs dogmatic. The approaches have
  their own advantages and disadvantages, but as often in the real
  world, a combination of them is stronger than either one of them
  separately.</p>

  <p><a name="index-X_002dHashcash-2724" id=
  "index-X_002dHashcash-2724"></a>The &ldquo;something
  costly&rdquo; is to burn CPU time, more specifically to compute a
  hash collision up to a certain number of bits. The resulting
  hashcash cookie is inserted in a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">X-Hashcash:</span></samp>&rsquo; header. For more details,
  and for the external application <code>hashcash</code> you need
  to install to use this feature, see <a href=
  "http://www.hashcash.org/">http://www.hashcash.org/</a>. Even
  more information can be found at <a href=
  "http://www.camram.org/">http://www.camram.org/</a>.</p>

  <p>If you wish to generate hashcash for each message you send,
  you can customize <code>message-generate-hashcash</code> (see
  <a href="../message/Mail-Headers.html#Mail-Headers">Mail
  Headers</a>), as in:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq message-generate-hashcash t)
</pre>

  <p>You will need to set up some additional variables as well:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>hashcash-default-payment</code></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-hashcash_002ddefault_002dpayment-2725" id=
    "index-hashcash_002ddefault_002dpayment-2725"></a>This variable
    indicates the default number of bits the hash collision should
    consist of. By default this is 20. Suggested useful values
    include 17 to 29.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>hashcash-payment-alist</code></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-hashcash_002dpayment_002dalist-2726" id=
    "index-hashcash_002dpayment_002dalist-2726"></a>Some receivers
    may require you to spend burn more CPU time than the default.
    This variable contains a list of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">(</span><var>addr</var> <var>amount</var><span class=
    "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; cells, where <var>addr</var> is
    the receiver (email address or newsgroup) and <var>amount</var>
    is the number of bits in the collision that is needed. It can
    also contain &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">(</span><var>addr</var> <var>string</var>
    <var>amount</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;
    cells, where the <var>string</var> is the string to use
    (normally the email address or newsgroup name is
    used).<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>hashcash-path</code></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-hashcash_002dpath-2727" id=
    "index-hashcash_002dpath-2727"></a>Where the
    <code>hashcash</code> binary is installed. This variable should
    be automatically set by <code>executable-find</code>, but if
    it's <code>nil</code> (usually because the
    <code>hashcash</code> binary is not in your path) you'll get a
    warning when you check hashcash payments and an error when you
    generate hashcash payments.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Gnus can verify hashcash cookies, although this can also be
  done by hand customized mail filtering scripts. To verify a
  hashcash cookie in a message, use the
  <code>mail-check-payment</code> function in the
  <code>hashcash.el</code> library. You can also use the
  <code>spam.el</code> package with the
  <code>spam-use-hashcash</code> back end to validate hashcash
  cookies in incoming mail and filter mail accordingly (see
  <a href="Anti_002dspam-Hashcash-Payments.html#Anti_002dspam-Hashcash-Payments">
  Anti-spam Hashcash Payments</a>).</p>
