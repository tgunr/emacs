  and ham processors specify special actions to take when you exit
  a group buffer. Spam processors act on spam messages, and ham
  processors on ham messages. At present, the main role of these
  processors is to update the dictionaries of dictionary-based spam
  back ends such as Bogofilter (see <a href=
  "Bogofilter.html#Bogofilter">Bogofilter</a>) and the Spam
  Statistics package (see <a href=
  "Spam-Statistics-Filtering.html#Spam-Statistics-Filtering">Spam
  Statistics Filtering</a>).</p>

  <p>The spam and ham processors that apply to each group are
  determined by the group's<code>spam-process</code> group
  parameter. If this group parameter is not defined, they are
  determined by the variable
  <code>gnus-spam-process-newsgroups</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dspam_002dnewsgroup_002dcontents-2754"
  id="index-gnus_002dspam_002dnewsgroup_002dcontents-2754"></a>Gnus
  learns from the spam you get. You have to collect your spam in
  one or more spam groups, and set or customize the variable
  <code>spam-junk-mailgroups</code> as appropriate. You can also
  declare groups to contain spam by setting their group parameter
  <code>spam-contents</code> to
  <code>gnus-group-spam-classification-spam</code>, or by
  customizing the corresponding variable
  <code>gnus-spam-newsgroup-contents</code>. The
  <code>spam-contents</code> group parameter and the
  <code>gnus-spam-newsgroup-contents</code> variable can also be
  used to declare groups as <em>ham</em> groups if you set their
  classification to
  <code>gnus-group-spam-classification-ham</code>. If groups are
  not classified by means of <code>spam-junk-mailgroups</code>,
  <code>spam-contents</code>, or
  <code>gnus-spam-newsgroup-contents</code>, they are considered
  <em>unclassified</em>. All groups are unclassified by
  default.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dspam_002dmark-2755" id=
  "index-gnus_002dspam_002dmark-2755"></a><a name=
  "index-g_t_0024-2756" id="index-g_t_0024-2756"></a>In spam
  groups, all messages are considered to be spam by default: they
  get the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;
  mark (<code>gnus-spam-mark</code>) when you enter the group. If
  you have seen a message, had it marked as spam, then unmarked it,
  it won't be marked as spam when you enter the group thereafter.
  You can disable that behavior, so all unread messages will get
  the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; mark,
  if you set the <code>spam-mark-only-unseen-as-spam</code>
  parameter to <code>nil</code>. You should remove the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; mark when
  you are in the group summary buffer for every message that is not
  spam after all. To remove the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; mark, you can use <kbd>M-u</kbd> to
  &ldquo;unread&rdquo; the article, or <kbd>d</kbd> for declaring
  it read the non-spam way. When you leave a group, all spam-marked
  (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;) articles
  are sent to a spam processor which will study them as spam
  samples.</p>

  <p>Messages may also be deleted in various other ways, and unless
  <code>ham-marks</code> group parameter gets overridden below,
  marks &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; for
  default read or explicit delete, marks &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">K</span></samp>&rsquo; for automatic or explicit kills, as
  well as mark &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Y</span></samp>&rsquo; for low scores, are all considered
  to be associated with articles which are not spam. This
  assumption might be false, in particular if you use kill files or
  score files as means for detecting genuine spam, you should then
  adjust the <code>ham-marks</code> group parameter.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You can customize this group or topic parameter to be the
      list of marks you want to consider ham. By default, the list
      contains the deleted, read, killed, kill-filed, and low-score
      marks (the idea is that these articles have been read, but
      are not spam). It can be useful to also include the tick mark
      in the ham marks. It is not recommended to make the unread
      mark a ham mark, because it normally indicates a lack of
      classification. But you can do it, and we'll be happy for
      you.</p>

  <p>When you leave <em>any</em> group, regardless of its
  <code>spam-contents</code> classification, all spam-marked
  articles are sent to a spam processor, which will study these as
  spam samples. If you explicit kill a lot, you might sometimes end
  up with articles marked &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">K</span></samp>&rsquo; which you never saw, and which
  might accidentally contain spam. Best is to make sure that real
  spam is marked with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, and nothing else.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dham_002dprocess_002ddestinations-2759"
  id=
  "index-gnus_002dham_002dprocess_002ddestinations-2759"></a>When
  you leave a <em>spam</em> group, all spam-marked articles are
  marked as expired after processing with the spam processor. This
  is not done for <em>unclassified</em> or <em>ham</em> groups.
  Also, any <strong>ham</strong> articles in a spam group will be
  moved to a location determined by either the
  <code>ham-process-destination</code> group parameter or a match
  in the <code>gnus-ham-process-destinations</code> variable, which
  is a list of regular expressions matched with group names (it's
  easiest to customize this variable with <kbd>M-x
  customize-variable &lt;RET&gt;
  gnus-ham-process-destinations</kbd>). Each group name list is a
  standard Lisp list, if you prefer to customize the variable
  manually. If the <code>ham-process-destination</code> parameter
  is not set, ham articles are left in place. If the
  <code>spam-mark-ham-unread-before-move-from-spam-group</code>
  parameter is set, the ham articles are marked as unread before
  being moved.</p>

  <p>If ham can not be moved&mdash;because of a read-only back end
  such as <acronym>NNTP</acronym>, for example, it will be
  copied.</p>

  <p>Note that you can use multiples destinations per group or
  regular expression! This enables you to send your ham to a
  regular mail group and to a <em>ham training</em> group.</p>

  <p>When you leave a <em>ham</em> group, all ham-marked articles
  are sent to a ham processor, which will study these as non-spam
  samples.</p>

  default the variable <code>spam-process-ham-in-spam-groups</code>
  is <code>nil</code>. Set it to <code>t</code> if you want ham

  you are expected instead to send your ham to a ham group and
  process it there.</p>

  </a>By default the variable
  <code>spam-process-ham-in-nonham-groups</code> is
  <code>nil</code>. Set it to <code>t</code> if you want ham found

  Normally this is not done, you are expected instead to send your

  you leave a <em>ham</em> or <em>unclassified</em> group, all
  <strong>spam</strong> articles are moved to a location determined
  by either the <code>spam-process-destination</code> group
  parameter or a match in the
  <code>gnus-spam-process-destinations</code> variable, which is a
  list of regular expressions matched with group names (it's

  standard Lisp list, if you prefer to customize the variable
  manually. If the <code>spam-process-destination</code> parameter
  is not set, the spam articles are only expired. The group name is
  fully qualified, meaning that if you see
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nntp:servername</span></samp>&rsquo;
  before the group name in the group buffer then you need it here
  as well.</p>

  <p>If spam can not be moved&mdash;because of a read-only back end
  such as <acronym>NNTP</acronym>, for example, it will be
  copied.</p>

  <p>Note that you can use multiples destinations per group or

  multiple <em>spam training</em> groups.</p>

  "index-spam_002dlog_002dto_002dregistry-2763"></a>The problem
  with processing ham and spam is that Gnus doesn't track this
  processing by default. Enable the
  <code>spam-log-to-registry</code> variable so
  <code>spam.el</code> will use <code>gnus-registry.el</code> to
  track what articles have been processed, and avoid processing
  articles multiple times. Keep in mind that if you limit the
  number of registry entries, this won't work as well as it does
  without a limit.</p>

  </a>Set this variable if you want only unseen articles in spam
  groups to be marked as spam. By default, it is set. If you set it

  </a>Set this variable if you want ham to be unmarked before it is
  moved out of the spam group. This is very useful when you use
  something like the tick mark &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; to mark ham&mdash;the article will
  be placed in your <code>ham-process-destination</code>, unmarked
  as if it came fresh from the mail server.</p>

  checked for spam. It is recommended that you leave it off.</p>
