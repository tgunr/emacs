  <h4 class="subsection">11.7.2 Back End Interface</h4>

  <p>Gnus doesn't know anything about <acronym>NNTP</acronym>,
  spools, mail or virtual groups. It only knows how to talk to
  <dfn>virtual servers</dfn>. A virtual server is a <dfn>back
  end</dfn> and some <dfn>back end variables</dfn>. As examples of
  the first, we have <code>nntp</code>, <code>nnspool</code> and
  <code>nnmbox</code>. As examples of the latter we have
  <code>nntp-port-number</code> and
  <code>nnmbox-directory</code>.</p>

  <p>When Gnus asks for information from a back end&mdash;say
  <code>nntp</code>&mdash;on something, it will normally include a
  virtual server name in the function parameters. (If not, the back
  end should use the &ldquo;current&rdquo; virtual server.) For
  instance, <code>nntp-request-list</code> takes a virtual server
  as its only (optional) parameter. If this virtual server hasn't
  been opened, the function should fail.</p>

  <p>Note that a virtual server name has no relation to some
  physical server name. Take this example:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (nntp "odd-one"
           (nntp-address "ifi.uio.no")
           (nntp-port-number 4324))
</pre>

  <p>Here the virtual server name is &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">odd-one</span></samp>&rsquo; while the name of the
  physical server is &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">ifi.uio.no</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The back ends should be able to switch between several virtual
  servers. The standard back ends implement this by keeping an
  alist of virtual server environments that they pull down/push up
  when needed.</p>

  <p>There are two groups of interface functions: <dfn>required
  functions</dfn>, which must be present, and <dfn>optional
  functions</dfn>, which Gnus will always check for presence before
  attempting to call 'em.</p>

  <p>All these functions are expected to return data in the buffer
  <code>nntp-server-buffer</code> (&lsquo; <samp><span class=
  "samp">*nntpd*</span></samp>&rsquo;), which is somewhat
  unfortunately named, but we'll have to live with it. When I talk
  about <dfn>resulting data</dfn>, I always refer to the data in
  that buffer. When I talk about <dfn>return value</dfn>, I talk
  about the function value returned by the function call. Functions
  that fail should return <code>nil</code> as the return value.</p>

  <p>Some back ends could be said to be <dfn>server-forming</dfn>
  back ends, and some might be said not to be. The latter are back
  ends that generally only operate on one group at a time, and have
  no concept of &ldquo;server&rdquo; &mdash;they have a group, and
  they deliver info on that group and nothing more.</p>

  <p>Gnus identifies each message by way of group name and article
  number. A few remarks about these article numbers might be
  useful. First of all, the numbers are positive integers.
  Secondly, it is normally not possible for later articles to
  &ldquo;re-use&rdquo; older article numbers without confusing
  Gnus. That is, if a group has ever contained a message numbered
  42, then no other message may get that number, or Gnus will get
  mightily confused.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id=
  "fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> Third, article numbers must be assigned
  in order of arrival in the group; this is not necessarily the
  same as the date of the message.</p>

  <p>The previous paragraph already mentions all the
  &ldquo;hard&rdquo; restrictions that article numbers must
  fulfill. But it seems that it might be useful to assign
  <em>consecutive</em> article numbers, for Gnus gets quite
  confused if there are holes in the article numbering sequence.
  However, due to the &ldquo;no-reuse&rdquo; restriction, holes
  cannot be avoided altogether. It's also useful for the article
  numbers to start at 1 to avoid running out of numbers as long as
  possible.</p>

  <p>Note that by convention, back ends are named
  <code>nnsomething</code>, but Gnus also comes with some
  <code>nnnotbackends</code>, such as <samp><span class=
  "file">nnheader.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "file">nnmail.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class=
  "file">nnoo.el</span></samp>.</p>

  <p>In the examples and definitions I will refer to the imaginary
  back end <code>nnchoke</code>.</p>
