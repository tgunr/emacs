  <h3 class="section">7.12 Global Score Files</h3>

  <p><a name="index-global-score-files-2514" id=
  "index-global-score-files-2514"></a> Sure, other newsreaders have
  &ldquo;global kill files&rdquo;. These are usually nothing more
  than a single kill file that applies to all groups, stored in the
  user's home directory. Bah! Puny, weak newsreaders!</p>

  <p>What I'm talking about here are Global Score Files. Score
  files from all over the world, from users everywhere, uniting all
  nations in one big, happy score file union! Ange-score! New and
  untested!</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dglobal_002dscore_002dfiles-2515" id=
  "index-gnus_002dglobal_002dscore_002dfiles-2515"></a>All you have
  to do to use other people's score files is to set the
  <code>gnus-global-score-files</code> variable. One entry for each
  score file, or each score file directory. Gnus will decide by
  itself what score files are applicable to which group.</p>

  <p>To use the score file <samp><span class=
  "file">/ftp@ftp.gnus.org:/pub/larsi/ding/score/soc.motss.SCORE</span></samp>
  and all score files in the <samp><span class=
  "file">/ftp@ftp.some-where:/pub/score</span></samp> directory,
  say this:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq gnus-global-score-files
           '("/ftp@ftp.gnus.org:/pub/larsi/ding/score/soc.motss.SCORE"
             "/ftp@ftp.some-where:/pub/score/"))
</pre>

  <p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dscore_002dsearch_002dglobal_002ddirectories-2516"
  id=
  "index-gnus_002dscore_002dsearch_002dglobal_002ddirectories-2516">
  </a>Simple, eh? Directory names must end with a
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;. These
  directories are typically scanned only once during each Gnus
  session. If you feel the need to manually re-scan the remote
  directories, you can use the
  <code>gnus-score-search-global-directories</code> command.</p>

  <p>Note that, at present, using this option will slow down group
  entry somewhat. (That is&mdash;a lot.)</p>

  <p>If you want to start maintaining score files for other people
  to use, just put your score file up for anonymous ftp and
  announce it to the world. Become a retro-moderator! Participate
  in the retro-moderator wars sure to ensue, where retro-moderators
  battle it out for the sympathy of the people, luring them to use
  their score files on false premises! Yay! The net is saved!</p>

  <p>Here are some tips for the would-be retro-moderator, off the
  top of my head:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Articles heavily crossposted are probably junk.</li>

    <li>To lower a single inappropriate article, lower by
    <code>Message-ID</code>.</li>

    <li>Particularly brilliant authors can be raised on a permanent
    basis.</li>

    <li>Authors that repeatedly post off-charter for the group can
    safely be lowered out of existence.</li>

    <li>Set the <code>mark</code> and <code>expunge</code> atoms to
    obliterate the nastiest articles completely.</li>

    <li>Use expiring score entries to keep the size of the file
    down. You should probably have a long expiry period, though, as
    some sites keep old articles for a long time.</li>
  </ul><small class="dots">...</small>

  <p>I wonder whether other newsreaders will support global score
  files in the future. <em>Snicker</em>. Yup, any day now,
  newsreaders like Blue Wave, xrn and 1stReader are bound to
  implement scoring. Should we start holding our breath yet?</p>
