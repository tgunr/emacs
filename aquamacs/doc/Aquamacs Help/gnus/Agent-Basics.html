  <h4 class="subsection">6.9.1 Agent Basics</h4>

  <p>First, let's get some terminology out of the way.</p>

  <p>The Gnus Agent is said to be <dfn>unplugged</dfn> when you
  have severed the connection to the net (and notified the Agent
  that this is the case). When the connection to the net is up
  again (and Gnus knows this), the Agent is <dfn>plugged</dfn>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>local</dfn> machine is the one you're running on, and
  which isn't connected to the net continuously.</p>

  <p><dfn>Downloading</dfn> means fetching things from the net to
  your local machine. <dfn>Uploading</dfn> is doing the
  opposite.</p>

  <p>You know that Gnus gives you all the opportunity you'd ever
  want for shooting yourself in the foot. Some people call it
  flexibility. Gnus is also customizable to a great extent, which
  means that the user has a say on how Gnus behaves. Other
  newsreaders might unconditionally shoot you in your foot, but
  with Gnus, you have a choice!</p>

  <p>Gnus is never really in plugged or unplugged state. Rather, it
  applies that state to each server individually. This means that
  some servers can be plugged while others can be unplugged.
  Additionally, some servers can be ignored by the Agent altogether
  (which means that they're kinda like plugged always).</p>

  <p>So when you unplug the Agent and then wonder why is Gnus
  opening a connection to the Net, the next step to do is to look
  whether all servers are agentized. If there is an unagentized
  server, you found the culprit.</p>

  <p>Another thing is the <dfn>offline</dfn> state. Sometimes,
  servers aren't reachable. When Gnus notices this, it asks you
  whether you want the server to be switched to offline state. If
  you say yes, then the server will behave somewhat as if it was
  unplugged, except that Gnus will ask you whether you want to
  switch it back online again.</p>

  <p>Let's take a typical Gnus session using the Agent.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a name="index-gnus_002dunplugged-2319" id=
    "index-gnus_002dunplugged-2319"></a>You start Gnus with
    <code>gnus-unplugged</code>. This brings up the Gnus Agent in a
    disconnected state. You can read all the news that you have
    already fetched while in this mode.</li>

    <li>You then decide to see whether any new news has arrived.
    You connect your machine to the net (using PPP or whatever),
    and then hit <kbd>J j</kbd> to make Gnus become
    <dfn>plugged</dfn> and use <kbd>g</kbd> to check for new mail
    as usual. To check for new mail in unplugged mode (see <a href=
    "Mail-Source-Specifiers.html#Mail-Source-Specifiers">Mail
    Source Specifiers</a>).</li>

    <li>You can then read the new news immediately, or you can
    download the news onto your local machine. If you want to do
    the latter, you press <kbd>g</kbd> to check if there are any
    new news and then <kbd>J s</kbd> to fetch all the eligible
    articles in all the groups. (To let Gnus know which articles
    you want to download, see <a href=
    "Agent-Categories.html#Agent-Categories">Agent
    Categories</a>).</li>

    <li>After fetching the articles, you press <kbd>J j</kbd> to
    make Gnus become unplugged again, and you shut down the PPP
    thing (or whatever). And then you read the news offline.</li>

    <li>And then you go to step 2.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here are some things you should do the first time (or so) that
  you use the Agent.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Decide which servers should be covered by the Agent. If you
    have a mail back end, it would probably be nonsensical to have
    it covered by the Agent. Go to the server buffer (<kbd>^</kbd>
    in the group buffer) and press <kbd>J a</kbd> on the server (or
    servers) that you wish to have covered by the Agent (see
    <a href=
    "Server-Agent-Commands.html#Server-Agent-Commands">Server Agent
    Commands</a>), or <kbd>J r</kbd> on automatically added servers
    you do not wish to have covered by the Agent. By default, all
    <code>nntp</code> and <code>nnimap</code> servers in
    <code>gnus-select-method</code> and
    <code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code> are agentized.</li>

    <li>Decide on download policy. It's fairly simple once you
    decide whether you are going to use agent categories, topic
    parameters, and/or group parameters to implement your policy.
    If you're new to gnus, it is probably best to start with a
    category, See <a href="Agent-Categories.html#Agent-Categories">
      Agent Categories</a>.

      <p>Both topic parameters (see <a href=
      "Topic-Parameters.html#Topic-Parameters">Topic
      Parameters</a>) and agent categories (see <a href=
      "Agent-Categories.html#Agent-Categories">Agent
      Categories</a>) provide for setting a policy that applies to
      multiple groups. Which you use is entirely up to you. Topic
      parameters do override categories so, if you mix the two,
      you'll have to take that into account. If you have a few
      groups that deviate from your policy, you can use group
      parameters (see <a href=
      "Group-Parameters.html#Group-Parameters">Group
      Parameters</a>) to configure them.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Uhm<small class="dots">...</small> that's it.</li>
  </ul>
