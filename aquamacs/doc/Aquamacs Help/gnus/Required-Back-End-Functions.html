  <h5 class="subsubsection">11.7.2.1 Required Back End
  Functions</h5>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>(nnchoke-retrieve-headers ARTICLES &amp;optional
    GROUP SERVER FETCH-OLD)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <var>articles</var> is either a range of article numbers or a
      list of <code>Message-ID</code>s. Current back ends do not
      fully support either&mdash;only sequences (lists) of article
      numbers, and most back ends do not support retrieval of
      <code>Message-ID</code>s. But they should try for both.

      <p>The result data should either be HEADs or
      <acronym>NOV</acronym> lines, and the result value should
      either be <code>headers</code> or <code>nov</code> to reflect
      this. This might later be expanded to <code>various</code>,
      which will be a mixture of HEADs and <acronym>NOV</acronym>
      lines, but this is currently not supported by Gnus.</p>

      <p>If <var>fetch-old</var> is non-<code>nil</code> it says to
      try fetching &ldquo;extra headers&rdquo;, in some meaning of
      the word. This is generally done by fetching (at most)
      <var>fetch-old</var> extra headers less than the smallest
      article number in <code>articles</code>, and filling the gaps
      as well. The presence of this parameter can be ignored if the
      back end finds it cumbersome to follow the request. If this
      is non-<code>nil</code> and not a number, do maximum
      fetches.</p>

      <p>Here's an example HEAD:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          221 1056 Article retrieved.
          Path: ifi.uio.no!sturles
          From: sturles@ifi.uio.no (Sturle Sunde)
          Newsgroups: ifi.discussion
          Subject: Re: Something very droll
          Date: 27 Oct 1994 14:02:57 +0100
          Organization: Dept. of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway
          Lines: 26
          Message-ID: &lt;38o8e1$a0o@holmenkollen.ifi.uio.no&gt;
          References: &lt;38jdmq$4qu@visbur.ifi.uio.no&gt;
          NNTP-Posting-Host: holmenkollen.ifi.uio.no
          .
</pre>

      <p>So a <code>headers</code> return value would imply that
      there's a number of these in the data buffer.</p>

      <p>Here's a BNF definition of such a buffer:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          headers        = *head
          head           = error / valid-head
          error-message  = [ "4" / "5" ] 2number " " &lt;error message&gt; eol
          valid-head     = valid-message *header "." eol
          valid-message  = "221 " &lt;number&gt; " Article retrieved." eol
          header         = &lt;text&gt; eol
</pre>

      <p><a name="index-BNF-3045" id="index-BNF-3045"></a>(The
      version of BNF used here is the one used in RFC822.)</p>

      <p>If the return value is <code>nov</code>, the data buffer
      should contain <dfn>network overview database</dfn> lines.
      These are basically fields separated by tabs.</p>
      <pre class="example">
          nov-buffer = *nov-line
          nov-line   = field 7*8[ &lt;TAB&gt; field ] eol
          field      = &lt;text except TAB&gt;
</pre>

      <p>For a closer look at what should be in those fields, see
      <a href="Headers.html#Headers">Headers</a>.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-open-server SERVER &amp;optional
    DEFINITIONS)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <var>server</var> is here the virtual server name.
      <var>definitions</var> is a list of <code>(VARIABLE
      VALUE)</code> pairs that define this virtual server.

      <p>If the server can't be opened, no error should be
      signaled. The back end may then choose to refuse further
      attempts at connecting to this server. In fact, it should do
      so.</p>

      <p>If the server is opened already, this function should
      return a non-<code>nil</code> value. There should be no data
      returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-close-server &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Close connection to <var>server</var> and free all resources
      connected to it. Return <code>nil</code> if the server
      couldn't be closed for some reason.

      <p>There should be no data returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-close)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Close connection to all servers and free all resources that
      the back end have reserved. All buffers that have been
      created by that back end should be killed. (Not the
      <code>nntp-server-buffer</code>, though.) This function is
      generally only called when Gnus is shutting down.

      <p>There should be no data returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-server-opened &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      If <var>server</var> is the current virtual server, and the
      connection to the physical server is alive, then this
      function should return a non-<code>nil</code> value. This
      function should under no circumstances attempt to reconnect
      to a server we have lost connection to.

      <p>There should be no data returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-status-message &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function should return the last error message from
      <var>server</var>.

      <p>There should be no data returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-article ARTICLE &amp;optional GROUP
    SERVER TO-BUFFER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      The result data from this function should be the article
      specified by <var>article</var>. This might either be a
      <code>Message-ID</code> or a number. It is optional whether
      to implement retrieval by <code>Message-ID</code>, but it
      would be nice if that were possible.

      <p>If <var>to-buffer</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the
      result data should be returned in this buffer instead of the
      normal data buffer. This is to make it possible to avoid
      copying large amounts of data from one buffer to another,
      while Gnus mainly requests articles to be inserted directly
      into its article buffer.</p>

      <p>If it is at all possible, this function should return a
      cons cell where the <code>car</code> is the group name the
      article was fetched from, and the <code>cdr</code> is the
      article number. This will enable Gnus to find out what the
      real group and article numbers are when fetching articles by
      <code>Message-ID</code>. If this isn't possible,
      <code>t</code> should be returned on successful article
      retrieval.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-group GROUP &amp;optional SERVER
    FAST INFO)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Get data on <var>group</var>. This function also has the side
      effect of making <var>group</var> the current group.

      <p>If <var>fast</var>, don't bother to return useful data,
      just make <var>group</var> the current group.</p>

      <p>If <var>info</var>, it allows the backend to update the
      group info structure.</p>

      <p>Here's an example of some result data and a definition of
      the same:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          211 56 1000 1059 ifi.discussion
</pre>

      <p>The first number is the status, which should be 211. Next
      is the total number of articles in the group, the lowest
      article number, the highest article number, and finally the
      group name. Note that the total number of articles may be
      less than one might think while just considering the highest
      and lowest article numbers, but some articles may have been
      canceled. Gnus just discards the total-number, so whether one
      should take the bother to generate it properly (if that is a
      problem) is left as an exercise to the reader. If the group
      contains no articles, the lowest article number should be
      reported as 1 and the highest as 0.</p>
      <pre class="example">
          group-status = [ error / info ] eol
          error        = [ "4" / "5" ] 2&lt;number&gt; " " &lt;Error message&gt;
          info         = "211 " 3* [ &lt;number&gt; " " ] &lt;string&gt;
</pre><br />
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-close-group GROUP &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Close <var>group</var> and free any resources connected to
      it. This will be a no-op on most back ends.

      <p>There should be no data returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-list &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Return a list of all groups available on <var>server</var>.
      And that means <em>all</em>.

      <p>Here's an example from a server that only carries two
      groups:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          ifi.test 0000002200 0000002000 y
          ifi.discussion 3324 3300 n
</pre>

      <p>On each line we have a group name, then the highest
      article number in that group, the lowest article number, and
      finally a flag. If the group contains no articles, the lowest
      article number should be reported as 1 and the highest as
      0.</p>
      <pre class="example">
          active-file = *active-line
          active-line = name " " &lt;number&gt; " " &lt;number&gt; " " flags eol
          name        = &lt;string&gt;
          flags       = "n" / "y" / "m" / "x" / "j" / "=" name
</pre>

      <p>The flag says whether the group is read-only
      (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;), is
      moderated (&lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo;), is dead
      (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;), is
      aliased to some other group (&lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">=other-group</span></samp>&rsquo;) or none of the
      above (&lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;).<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-post &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function should post the current buffer. It might return
      whether the posting was successful or not, but that's not
      required. If, for instance, the posting is done
      asynchronously, it has generally not been completed by the
      time this function concludes. In that case, this function
      should set up some kind of sentinel to beep the user loud and
      clear if the posting could not be completed.

      <p>There should be no result data from this function.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
