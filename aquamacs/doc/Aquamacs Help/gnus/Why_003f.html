  <h4 class="subsection">11.2.3 Why?</h4>

  <p>What's the point of Gnus?</p>

  <p>I want to provide a &ldquo;rad&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;happening&rdquo;, &ldquo;way cool&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;hep&rdquo; newsreader, that lets you do anything you can
  think of. That was my original motivation, but while working on
  Gnus, it has become clear to me that this generation of
  newsreaders really belong in the stone age. Newsreaders haven't
  developed much since the infancy of the net. If the volume
  continues to rise with the current rate of increase, all current
  newsreaders will be pretty much useless. How do you deal with
  newsgroups that have thousands of new articles each day? How do
  you keep track of millions of people who post?</p>

  <p>Gnus offers no real solutions to these questions, but I would
  very much like to see Gnus being used as a testing ground for new
  methods of reading and fetching news. Expanding on <span class=
  "sc">Umeda</span>-san's wise decision to separate the newsreader
  from the back ends, Gnus now offers a simple interface for
  anybody who wants to write new back ends for fetching mail and
  news from different sources. I have added hooks for
  customizations everywhere I could imagine it being useful. By
  doing so, I'm inviting every one of you to explore and
  invent.</p>

  <p>May Gnus never be complete. <kbd>C-u 100 M-x
  all-hail-emacs</kbd> and <kbd>C-u 100 M-x
  all-hail-xemacs</kbd>.</p>
