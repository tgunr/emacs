  <h5 class="subsubsection">6.4.13.11 Comparing Mail Back Ends</h5>

  <p>First, just for terminology, the <dfn>back end</dfn> is the
  common word for a low-level access method&mdash;a transport, if
  you will, by which something is acquired. The sense is that one's
  mail has to come from somewhere, and so selection of a suitable
  back end is required in order to get that mail within spitting
  distance of Gnus.</p>

  <p>The same concept exists for Usenet itself: Though access to
  articles is typically done by <acronym>NNTP</acronym> these days,
  once upon a midnight dreary, everyone in the world got at Usenet
  by running a reader on the machine where the articles lay (the
  machine which today we call an <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server),
  and access was by the reader stepping into the articles'
  directory spool area directly. One can still select between
  either the <code>nntp</code> or <code>nnspool</code> back ends,
  to select between these methods, if one happens actually to live
  on the server (or can see its spool directly, anyway, via
  NFS).</p>

  <p>The goal in selecting a mail back end is to pick one which
  simultaneously represents a suitable way of dealing with the
  original format plus leaving mail in a form that is convenient to
  use in the future. Here are some high and low points on each:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>nnmbox</code></dt>

    <dd>UNIX systems have historically had a single, very common,
    and well- defined format. All messages arrive in a single
    <dfn>spool file</dfn>, and they are delineated by a line whose
    regular expression matches &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">^From_</span></samp>&rsquo;. (My notational use of
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo; is to
    indicate a space, to make it clear in this instance that this
    is not the RFC-specified &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">From:</span></samp>&rsquo; header.) Because Emacs and
    therefore Gnus emanate historically from the Unix environment,
    it is simplest if one does not mess a great deal with the
    original mailbox format, so if one chooses this back end, Gnus'
    primary activity in getting mail from the real spool area to
    Gnus' preferred directory is simply to copy it, with no
    (appreciable) format change in the process. It is the
    &ldquo;dumbest&rdquo; way to move mail into availability in the
    Gnus environment. This makes it fast to move into place, but
    slow to parse, when Gnus has to look at what's
    where.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>nnbabyl</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Once upon a time, there was the DEC-10 and DEC-20, running
      operating systems called TOPS and related things, and the
      usual (only?) mail reading environment was a thing called
      Babyl. I don't know what format was used for mail landing on
      the system, but Babyl had its own internal format to which
      mail was converted, primarily involving creating a
      spool-file-like entity with a scheme for inserting
      Babyl-specific headers and status bits above the top of each
      message in the file. Rmail was Emacs' first mail reader, it
      was written by Richard Stallman, and Stallman came out of
      that TOPS/Babyl environment, so he wrote Rmail to understand
      the mail files folks already had in existence. Gnus (and VM,
      for that matter) continue to support this format because it's
      perceived as having some good qualities in those
      mailer-specific headers/status bits stuff. Rmail itself still
      exists as well, of course, and is still maintained within
      Emacs. Since Emacs 23, it uses standard mbox format rather
      than Babyl.

      <p>Both of the above forms leave your mail in a single file
      on your file system, and they must parse that entire file
      each time you take a look at your mail.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>nnml</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <code>nnml</code> is the back end which smells the most as
      though you were actually operating with an
      <code>nnspool</code>-accessed Usenet system. (In fact, I
      believe <code>nnml</code> actually derived from
      <code>nnspool</code> code, lo these years ago.) One's mail is
      taken from the original spool file, and is then cut up into
      individual message files, 1:1. It maintains a Usenet-style
      active file (analogous to what one finds in an INN- or
      CNews-based news system in (for instance) <samp><span class=
      "file">/var/lib/news/active</span></samp>, or what is
      returned via the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NNTP
      LIST</span></samp>&rsquo; verb) and also creates
      <dfn>overview</dfn> files for efficient group entry, as has
      been defined for <acronym>NNTP</acronym> servers for some
      years now. It is slower in mail-splitting, due to the
      creation of lots of files, updates to the <code>nnml</code>
      active file, and additions to overview files on a per-message
      basis, but it is extremely fast on access because of what
      amounts to the indexing support provided by the active file
      and overviews.

      <p><code>nnml</code> costs <dfn>inodes</dfn> in a big way;
      that is, it soaks up the resource which defines available
      places in the file system to put new files. Sysadmins take a
      dim view of heavy inode occupation within tight, shared file
      systems. But if you live on a personal machine where the file
      system is your own and space is not at a premium,
      <code>nnml</code> wins big.</p>

      <p>It is also problematic using this back end if you are
      living in a FAT16-based Windows world, since much space will
      be wasted on all these tiny files.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>nnmh</code></dt>

    <dd>The Rand MH mail-reading system has been around UNIX
    systems for a very long time; it operates by splitting one's
    spool file of messages into individual files, but with little
    or no indexing support&mdash;<code>nnmh</code> is considered to
    be semantically equivalent to &ldquo;<code>nnml</code> without
    active file or overviews&rdquo;. This is arguably the worst
    choice, because one gets the slowness of individual file
    creation married to the slowness of access parsing when
    learning what's new in one's groups.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>nnfolder</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Basically the effect of <code>nnfolder</code> is
      <code>nnmbox</code> (the first method described above) on a
      per-group basis. That is, <code>nnmbox</code> itself puts
      <em>all</em> one's mail in one file; <code>nnfolder</code>
      provides a little bit of optimization to this so that each of
      one's mail groups has a Unix mail box file. It's faster than
      <code>nnmbox</code> because each group can be parsed
      separately, and still provides the simple Unix mail box
      format requiring minimal effort in moving the mail around. In
      addition, it maintains an &ldquo;active&rdquo; file making it
      much faster for Gnus to figure out how many messages there
      are in each separate group.

      <p>If you have groups that are expected to have a massive
      amount of messages, <code>nnfolder</code> is not the best
      choice, but if you receive only a moderate amount of mail,
      <code>nnfolder</code> is probably the most friendly mail back
      end all over.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>nnmaildir</code></dt>

    <dd>
      For configuring expiry and other things,
      <code>nnmaildir</code> uses incompatible group parameters,
      slightly different from those of other mail back ends.

      <p><code>nnmaildir</code> is largely similar to
      <code>nnml</code>, with some notable differences. Each
      message is stored in a separate file, but the filename is
      unrelated to the article number in Gnus.
      <code>nnmaildir</code> also stores the equivalent of
      <code>nnml</code>'s overview files in one file per article,
      so it uses about twice as many inodes as <code>nnml</code>.
      (Use <code>df -i</code> to see how plentiful your inode
      supply is.) If this slows you down or takes up very much
      space, a non-block-structured file system.</p>

      <p>Since maildirs don't require locking for delivery, the
      maildirs you use as groups can also be the maildirs your mail
      is directly delivered to. This means you can skip Gnus' mail
      splitting if your mail is already organized into different
      mailboxes during delivery. A <code>directory</code> entry in
      <code>mail-sources</code> would have a similar effect, but
      would require one set of mailboxes for spooling deliveries
      (in mbox format, thus damaging message bodies), and another
      set to be used as groups (in whatever format you like). A
      maildir has a built-in spool, in the <code>new/</code>
      subdirectory. Beware that currently, mail moved from
      <code>new/</code> to <code>cur/</code> instead of via mail
      splitting will not undergo treatment such as duplicate
      checking.</p>

      <p><code>nnmaildir</code> stores article marks for a given
      group in the corresponding maildir, in a way designed so that
      it's easy to manipulate them from outside Gnus. You can tar
      up a maildir, unpack it somewhere else, and still have your
      marks. <code>nnml</code> also stores marks, but it's not as
      easy to work with them from outside Gnus as with
      <code>nnmaildir</code>.</p>

      <p><code>nnmaildir</code> uses a significant amount of memory
      to speed things up. (It keeps in memory some of the things
      that <code>nnml</code> stores in files and that
      <code>nnmh</code> repeatedly parses out of message files.) If
      this is a problem for you, you can set the
      <code>nov-cache-size</code> group parameter to something
      small (0 would probably not work, but 1 probably would) to
      make it use less memory. This caching will probably be
      removed in the future.</p>

      <p>Startup is likely to be slower with <code>nnmaildir</code>
      than with other back ends. Everything else is likely to be
      faster, depending in part on your file system.</p>

      <p><code>nnmaildir</code> does not use <code>nnoo</code>, so
      you cannot use <code>nnoo</code> to write an
      <code>nnmaildir</code>-derived back end.</p>
