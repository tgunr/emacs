  <h3 class="section">9.5 Window Layout</h3>

  <p><a name="index-window-layout-2613" id=
  "index-window-layout-2613"></a> No, there's nothing here about X,
  so be quiet.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002duse_002dfull_002dwindow-2614" id=
  "index-gnus_002duse_002dfull_002dwindow-2614"></a>If
  <code>gnus-use-full-window</code> non-<code>nil</code>, Gnus will
  delete all other windows and occupy the entire Emacs screen by
  itself. It is <code>t</code> by default.</p>

  <p>Setting this variable to <code>nil</code> kinda works, but
  there are glitches. Use at your own peril.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dbuffer_002dconfiguration-2615" id=
  "index-gnus_002dbuffer_002dconfiguration-2615"></a><code>gnus-buffer-configuration</code>
  describes how much space each Gnus buffer should be given. Here's
  an excerpt of this variable:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     ((group (vertical 1.0 (group 1.0 point)))
      (article (vertical 1.0 (summary 0.25 point)
                             (article 1.0))))
</pre>

  <p>This is an alist. The <dfn>key</dfn> is a symbol that names
  some action or other. For instance, when displaying the group
  buffer, the window configuration function will use
  <code>group</code> as the key. A full list of possible names is
  listed below.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>value</dfn> (i.e., the <dfn>split</dfn>) says how
  much space each buffer should occupy. To take the
  <code>article</code> split as an example -</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (article (vertical 1.0 (summary 0.25 point)
                            (article 1.0)))
</pre>

  <p>This <dfn>split</dfn> says that the summary buffer should
  occupy 25% of upper half of the screen, and that it is placed
  over the article buffer. As you may have noticed, 100% + 25% is
  actually 125% (yup, I saw y'all reaching for that calculator
  there). However, the special number <code>1.0</code> is used to
  signal that this buffer should soak up all the rest of the space
  available after the rest of the buffers have taken whatever they
  need. There should be only one buffer with the <code>1.0</code>
  size spec per split.</p>

  <p>Point will be put in the buffer that has the optional third
  element <code>point</code>. In a <code>frame</code> split, the
  last subsplit having a leaf split where the tag
  <code>frame-focus</code> is a member (i.e. is the third or fourth
  element in the list, depending on whether the <code>point</code>
  tag is present) gets focus.</p>

  <p>Here's a more complicated example:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (article (vertical 1.0 (group 4)
                            (summary 0.25 point)
                            (article 1.0)))
</pre>

  <p>If the size spec is an integer instead of a floating point
  number, then that number will be used to say how many lines a
  buffer should occupy, not a percentage.</p>

  <p>If the <dfn>split</dfn> looks like something that can be
  <code>eval</code>ed (to be precise&mdash;if the <code>car</code>
  of the split is a function or a subr), this split will be
  <code>eval</code>ed. If the result is non-<code>nil</code>, it
  will be used as a split.</p>

  <p>Not complicated enough for you? Well, try this on for
  size:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (article (horizontal 1.0
                  (vertical 0.5
                      (group 1.0))
                  (vertical 1.0
                      (summary 0.25 point)
                      (article 1.0))))
</pre>

  <p>Whoops. Two buffers with the mystery 100% tag. And what's that
  <code>horizontal</code> thingie?</p>

  <p>If the first element in one of the split is
  <code>horizontal</code>, Gnus will split the window horizontally,
  giving you two windows side-by-side. Inside each of these strips
  you may carry on all you like in the normal fashion. The number
  following <code>horizontal</code> says what percentage of the
  screen is to be given to this strip.</p>

  <p>For each split, there <em>must</em> be one element that has
  the 100% tag. The splitting is never accurate, and this buffer
  will eat any leftover lines from the splits.</p>

  <p>To be slightly more formal, here's a definition of what a
  valid split may look like:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     split      = frame | horizontal | vertical | buffer | form
     frame      = "(frame " size *split ")"
     horizontal = "(horizontal " size *split ")"
     vertical   = "(vertical " size *split ")"
     buffer     = "(" buf-name " " size *[ "point" ] *[ "frame-focus"] ")"
     size       = number | frame-params
     buf-name   = group | article | summary ...
</pre>

  <p>The limitations are that the <code>frame</code> split can only
  appear as the top-level split. <var>form</var> should be an Emacs
  Lisp form that should return a valid split. We see that each
  split is fully recursive, and may contain any number of
  <code>vertical</code> and <code>horizontal</code> splits.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dwindow_002dmin_002dwidth-2616" id=
  "index-gnus_002dwindow_002dmin_002dwidth-2616"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dwindow_002dmin_002dheight-2617" id=
  "index-gnus_002dwindow_002dmin_002dheight-2617"></a><a name=
  "index-window-height-2618" id=
  "index-window-height-2618"></a><a name="index-window-width-2619"
  id="index-window-width-2619"></a>Finding the right sizes can be a
  bit complicated. No window may be less than
  <code>gnus-window-min-height</code> (default 1) characters high,
  and all windows must be at least
  <code>gnus-window-min-width</code> (default 1) characters wide.
  Gnus will try to enforce this before applying the splits. If you
  want to use the normal Emacs window width/height limit, you can
  just set these two variables to <code>nil</code>.</p>

  <p>If you're not familiar with Emacs terminology,
  <code>horizontal</code> and <code>vertical</code> splits may work
  the opposite way of what you'd expect. Windows inside a
  <code>horizontal</code> split are shown side-by-side, and windows
  within a <code>vertical</code> split are shown above each
  other.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dconfigure_002dframe-2620" id=
  "index-gnus_002dconfigure_002dframe-2620"></a>If you want to
  experiment with window placement, a good tip is to call
  <code>gnus-configure-frame</code> directly with a split. This is
  the function that does all the real work when splitting buffers.
  Below is a pretty nonsensical configuration with 5 windows; two
  for the group buffer and three for the article buffer. (I said it
  was nonsensical.) If you <code>eval</code> the statement below,
  you can get an idea of how that would look straight away, without
  going through the normal Gnus channels. Play with it until you're
  satisfied, and then use <code>gnus-add-configuration</code> to
  add your new creation to the buffer configuration list.</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (gnus-configure-frame
      '(horizontal 1.0
         (vertical 10
           (group 1.0)
           (article 0.3 point))
         (vertical 1.0
           (article 1.0)
           (horizontal 4
             (group 1.0)
             (article 10)))))
</pre>

  <p>You might want to have several frames as well. No
  prob&mdash;just use the <code>frame</code> split:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (gnus-configure-frame
      '(frame 1.0
              (vertical 1.0
                        (summary 0.25 point frame-focus)
                        (article 1.0))
              (vertical ((height . 5) (width . 15)
                         (user-position . t)
                         (left . -1) (top . 1))
                        (picon 1.0))))

</pre>

  <p>This split will result in the familiar summary/article window
  configuration in the first (or &ldquo;main&rdquo;) frame, while a
  small additional frame will be created where picons will be
  shown. As you can see, instead of the normal <code>1.0</code>
  top-level spec, each additional split should have a frame
  parameter alist as the size spec. See <a href=
  "../elisp/Frame-Parameters.html#Frame-Parameters">Frame
  Parameters</a>. Under XEmacs, a frame property list will be
  accepted, too&mdash;for instance, <code>(height 5 width 15 left
  -1 top 1)</code> is such a plist. The list of all possible keys
  for <code>gnus-buffer-configuration</code> can be found in its
  default value.</p>

  <p>Note that the <code>message</code> key is used for both
  <code>gnus-group-mail</code> and
  <code>gnus-summary-mail-other-window</code>. If it is desirable
  to distinguish between the two, something like this might be
  used:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (message (horizontal 1.0
                          (vertical 1.0 (message 1.0 point))
                          (vertical 0.24
                                    (if (buffer-live-p gnus-summary-buffer)
                                        '(summary 0.5))
                                    (group 1.0))))
</pre>

  <p>One common desire for a multiple frame split is to have a
  separate frame for composing mail and news while leaving the
  original frame intact. To accomplish that, something like the
  following can be done:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (message
       (frame 1.0
              (if (not (buffer-live-p gnus-summary-buffer))
                  (car (cdr (assoc 'group gnus-buffer-configuration)))
                (car (cdr (assoc 'summary gnus-buffer-configuration))))
              (vertical ((user-position . t) (top . 1) (left . 1)
                         (name . "Message"))
                        (message 1.0 point))))
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dadd_002dconfiguration-2621" id=
  "index-gnus_002dadd_002dconfiguration-2621"></a>Since the
  <code>gnus-buffer-configuration</code> variable is so long and
  complicated, there's a function you can use to ease changing the
  config of a single setting: <code>gnus-add-configuration</code>.
  If, for instance, you want to change the <code>article</code>
  setting, you could say:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (gnus-add-configuration
      '(article (vertical 1.0
                    (group 4)
                    (summary .25 point)
                    (article 1.0))))
</pre>

  <p>You'd typically stick these
  <code>gnus-add-configuration</code> calls in your
  <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file or in some
  startup hook&mdash;they should be run after Gnus has been
  loaded.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dalways_002dforce_002dwindow_002dconfiguration-2622"
  id=
  "index-gnus_002dalways_002dforce_002dwindow_002dconfiguration-2622">
  </a>If all windows mentioned in the configuration are already
  visible, Gnus won't change the window configuration. If you
  always want to force the &ldquo;right&rdquo; window
  configuration, you can set
  <code>gnus-always-force-window-configuration</code> to
  non-<code>nil</code>.</p>

  <p>If you're using tree displays (see <a href=
  "Tree-Display.html#Tree-Display">Tree Display</a>), and the tree
  window is displayed vertically next to another window, you may
  also want to fiddle with <code>gnus-tree-minimize-window</code>
  to avoid having the windows resized.</p>
