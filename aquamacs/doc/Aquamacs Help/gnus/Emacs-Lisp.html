  <h4 class="subsection">11.8.2 Emacs Lisp</h4>

  <p>Emacs is the King of Editors because it's really a Lisp
  interpreter. Each and every key you tap runs some Emacs Lisp code
  snippet, and since Emacs Lisp is an interpreted language, that
  means that you can configure any key to run any arbitrary code.
  You just, like, do it.</p>

  <p>Gnus is written in Emacs Lisp, and is run as a bunch of
  interpreted functions. (These are byte-compiled for speed, but
  it's still interpreted.) If you decide that you don't like the
  way Gnus does certain things, it's trivial to have it do
  something a different way. (Well, at least if you know how to
  write Lisp code.) However, that's beyond the scope of this
  manual, so we are simply going to talk about some common
  constructs that you normally use in your <samp><span class=
  "file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file to customize Gnus. (You can
  also use the <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp>
  file, but in order to set things of Gnus up, it is much better to
  use the <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file,
  See <a href="Startup-Files.html#Startup-Files">Startup
  Files</a>.)</p>

  <p>If you want to set the variable <code>gnus-florgbnize</code>
  to four (4), you write the following:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq gnus-florgbnize 4)
</pre>

  <p>This function (really &ldquo;special form&rdquo;)
  <code>setq</code> is the one that can set a variable to some
  value. This is really all you need to know. Now you can go and
  fill your <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file
  with lots of these to change how Gnus works.</p>

  <p>If you have put that thing in your <samp><span class=
  "file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file, it will be read and
  <code>eval</code>ed (which is Lisp-ese for &ldquo;run&rdquo;) the
  next time you start Gnus. If you want to change the variable
  right away, simply say <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> after the closing
  parenthesis. That will <code>eval</code> the previous
  &ldquo;form&rdquo;, which is a simple <code>setq</code> statement
  here.</p>

  <p>Go ahead&mdash;just try it, if you're located at your Emacs.
  After you <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>, you will see
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>&rsquo; appear in
  the echo area, which is the return value of the form you
  <code>eval</code>ed.</p>

  <p>Some pitfalls:</p>

  <p>If the manual says &ldquo;set
  <code>gnus-read-active-file</code> to <code>some</code>&rdquo;,
  that means:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq gnus-read-active-file 'some)
</pre>

  <p>On the other hand, if the manual says &ldquo;set
  <code>gnus-nntp-server-file</code> to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">/etc/nntpserver</span></samp>&rsquo;&rdquo;, that
  means:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq gnus-nntp-server-file "/etc/nntpserver")
</pre>

  <p>So be careful not to mix up strings (the latter) with symbols
  (the former). The manual is unambiguous, but it can be confusing.
