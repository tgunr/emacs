  An <dfn>nnvirtual group</dfn> is really nothing more than a
  collection of other groups.</p>

  <p>For instance, if you are tired of reading many small groups,
  you can put them all in one big group, and then grow tired of
  reading one big, unwieldy group. The joys of computing!</p>

  <p>You specify <code>nnvirtual</code> as the method. The address
  should be a regexp to match component groups.</p>

  <p>All marks in the virtual group will stick to the articles in
  the component groups. So if you tick an article in a virtual
  group, the article will also be ticked in the component group
  from whence it came. (And vice versa&mdash;marks from the
  component groups will also be shown in the virtual group.). To
  create an empty virtual group, run <kbd>G V</kbd>
  (<code>gnus-group-make-empty-virtual</code>) in the group buffer
  and edit the method regexp with <kbd>M-e</kbd>
  (<code>gnus-group-edit-group-method</code>)</p>

  <p>Here's an example <code>nnvirtual</code> method that collects
  all Andrea Dworkin newsgroups into one, big, happy newsgroup:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (nnvirtual "^alt\\.fan\\.andrea-dworkin$\\|^rec\\.dworkin.*")
</pre>

  <p>The component groups can be native or foreign; everything
  should work smoothly, but if your computer explodes, it was
  probably my fault.</p>

  <p>Collecting the same group from several servers might actually
  be a good idea if users have set the Distribution header to limit
  distribution. If you would like to read &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">soc.motss</span></samp>&rsquo; both from a server in Japan
  and a server in Norway, you could use the following as the group
  regexp:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     "^nntp\\+server\\.jp:soc\\.motss$\\|^nntp\\+server\\.no:soc\\.motss$"
</pre>

  <p>(Remember, though, that if you're creating the group with
  <kbd>G m</kbd>, you shouldn't double the backslashes, and you
  should leave off the quote characters at the beginning and the
  end of the string.)</p>

  <p>This should work kinda smoothly&mdash;all articles from both
  groups should end up in this one, and there should be no
  duplicates. Threading (and the rest) will still work as usual,
  but there might be problems with the sequence of articles.
  Sorting on date might be an option here (see <a href=
  "Selecting-a-Group.html#Selecting-a-Group">Selecting a
  Group</a>).</p>

  <p>One limitation, however&mdash;all groups included in a virtual
  group have to be alive (i.e., subscribed or unsubscribed). Killed
  or zombie groups can't be component groups for
  <code>nnvirtual</code> groups.</p>

  <p><a name="index-nnvirtual_002dalways_002drescan-2283" id=
  "index-nnvirtual_002dalways_002drescan-2283"></a>If the
  <code>nnvirtual-always-rescan</code> variable is
  non-<code>nil</code> (which is the default),
  <code>nnvirtual</code> will always scan groups for unread
  articles when entering a virtual group. If this variable is
  <code>nil</code> and you read articles in a component group after
  the virtual group has been activated, the read articles from the
  component group will show up when you enter the virtual group.
  You'll also see this effect if you have two virtual groups that
  have a component group in common. If that's the case, you should
  set this variable to <code>t</code>. Or you can just tap
  <code>M-g</code> on the virtual group every time before you enter
  it&mdash;it'll have much the same effect.</p>

  <p><code>nnvirtual</code> can have both mail and news groups as
  component groups. When responding to articles in
  <code>nnvirtual</code> groups, <code>nnvirtual</code> has to ask
  the back end of the component group the article comes from
  whether it is a news or mail back end. However, when you do a
  <kbd>^</kbd>, there is typically no sure way for the component
  back end to know this, and in that case <code>nnvirtual</code>
  tells Gnus that the article came from a not-news back end. (Just
  to be on the safe side.)</p>

  <p><kbd>C-c C-n</kbd> in the message buffer will insert the
  <code>Newsgroups</code> line from the article you respond to in
  these cases.</p>

  <p><code>nnvirtual</code> groups do not inherit anything but
  articles and marks from component groups&mdash;group parameters,
  for instance, are not inherited.</p>
