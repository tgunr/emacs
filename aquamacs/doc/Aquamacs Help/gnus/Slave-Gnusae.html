  <h3 class="section">1.3 Slave Gnusae</h3>

  <p><a name="index-slave-17" id="index-slave-17"></a> You might
  want to run more than one Emacs with more than one Gnus at the
  same time. If you are using different <samp><span class=
  "file">.newsrc</span></samp> files (e.g., if you are using the
  two different Gnusae to read from two different servers), that is
  no problem whatsoever. You just do it.</p>

  <p>The problem appears when you want to run two Gnusae that use
  the same <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.</p>

  <p>To work around that problem some, we here at the Think-Tank at
  the Gnus Towers have come up with a new concept:
  <dfn>Masters</dfn> and <dfn>slaves</dfn>. (We have applied for a
  patent on this concept, and have taken out a copyright on those
  words. If you wish to use those words in conjunction with each
  other, you have to send $1 per usage instance to me. Usage of the
  patent (<dfn>Master/Slave Relationships In Computer
  Applications</dfn>) will be much more expensive, of course.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dslave-18" id=
  "index-gnus_002dslave-18"></a>Anyway, you start one Gnus up the
  normal way with <kbd>M-x gnus</kbd> (or however you do it). Each
  subsequent slave Gnusae should be started with <kbd>M-x
  gnus-slave</kbd>. These slaves won't save normal
  <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> files, but instead
  save <dfn>slave files</dfn> that contain information only on what
  groups have been read in the slave session. When a master Gnus
  starts, it will read (and delete) these slave files,
  incorporating all information from them. (The slave files will be
  read in the sequence they were created, so the latest changes
  will have precedence.)</p>

  <p>Information from the slave files has, of course, precedence
  over the information in the normal (i.e., master)
  <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.</p>

  <p>If the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc*</span></samp> files
  have not been saved in the master when the slave starts, you may
  be prompted as to whether to read an auto-save file. If you
  answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, the unsaved changes to the master will
  be incorporated into the slave. If you answer &ldquo;no&rdquo;,
  the slave may see some messages as unread that have been read in
  the master.</p>
