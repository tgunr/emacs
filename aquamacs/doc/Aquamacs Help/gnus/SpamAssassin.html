  <h4 class="subsection">9.17.3 SpamAssassin, Vipul's Razor, DCC,
  etc</h4>

  <p><a name="index-SpamAssassin-2720" id=
  "index-SpamAssassin-2720"></a><a name=
  "index-Vipul_0027s-Razor-2721" id=
  "index-Vipul_0027s-Razor-2721"></a><a name="index-DCC-2722" id=
  "index-DCC-2722"></a> The days where the hints in the previous
  section were sufficient in avoiding spam are coming to an end.
  There are many tools out there that claim to reduce the amount of
  spam you get. This section could easily become outdated fast, as
  new products replace old, but fortunately most of these tools
  seem to have similar interfaces. Even though this section will
  use SpamAssassin as an example, it should be easy to adapt it to
  most other tools.</p>

  <p>Note that this section does not involve the
  <code>spam.el</code> package, which is discussed in the next
  section. If you don't care for all the features of
  <code>spam.el</code>, you can make do with these simple
  recipes.</p>

  <p>If the tool you are using is not installed on the mail server,
  you need to invoke it yourself. Ideas on how to use the
  <code>:postscript</code> mail source parameter (see <a href=
  "Mail-Source-Specifiers.html#Mail-Source-Specifiers">Mail Source
  Specifiers</a>) follow.</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq mail-sources
           '((file :prescript "formail -bs spamassassin &lt; /var/mail/%u")
             (pop :user "jrl"
                  :server "pophost"
                  :postscript
                  "mv %t /tmp/foo; formail -bs spamc &lt; /tmp/foo &gt; %t")))
</pre>

  <p>Once you manage to process your incoming spool somehow, thus
  making the mail contain e.g. a header indicating it is spam, you
  are ready to filter it out. Using normal split methods (see
  <a href="Splitting-Mail.html#Splitting-Mail">Splitting
  Mail</a>):</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq nnmail-split-methods '(("spam"  "^X-Spam-Flag: YES")
                                  ...))
</pre>

  <p>Or using fancy split methods (see <a href=
  "Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy Mail
  Splitting</a>):</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq nnmail-split-methods 'nnmail-split-fancy
           nnmail-split-fancy '(| ("X-Spam-Flag" "YES" "spam")
                                  ...))
</pre>

  <p>Some people might not like the idea of piping the mail through
  various programs using a <code>:prescript</code> (if some program
  is buggy, you might lose all mail). If you are one of them,
  another solution is to call the external tools during splitting.
  Example fancy split method:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq nnmail-split-fancy '(| (: kevin-spamassassin)
                                  ...))
     (defun kevin-spamassassin ()
       (save-excursion
         (save-restriction
           (widen)
           (if (eq 1 (call-process-region (point-min) (point-max)
                                          "spamc" nil nil nil "-c"))
               "spam"))))
</pre>

  <p>Note that with the nnimap back end, message bodies will not be
  downloaded by default. You need to set
  <code>nnimap-split-download-body</code> to <code>t</code> to do
  that (see <a href=
  "Client_002dSide-IMAP-Splitting.html#Client_002dSide-IMAP-Splitting">
  Client-Side IMAP Splitting</a>).</p>

  <p>That is about it. As some spam is likely to get through
  anyway, you might want to have a nifty function to call when you
  happen to read spam. And here is the nifty function:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (defun my-gnus-raze-spam ()
       "Submit SPAM to Vipul's Razor, then mark it as expirable."
       (interactive)
       (gnus-summary-save-in-pipe "razor-report -f -d" t)
       (gnus-summary-mark-as-expirable 1))
</pre>
</body>
