  <h3 class="section">9.1 Process/Prefix</h3>

  <p><a name="index-process_002fprefix-convention-2591" id=
  "index-process_002fprefix-convention-2591"></a> Many functions,
  among them functions for moving, decoding and saving articles,
  use what is known as the <dfn>Process/Prefix
  convention</dfn>.</p>

  <p>This is a method for figuring out what articles the user wants
  the command to be performed on.</p>

  <p>It goes like this:</p>

  <p>If the numeric prefix is N, perform the operation on the next
  N articles, starting with the current one. If the numeric prefix
  is negative, perform the operation on the previous N articles,
  starting with the current one.</p>

  <p><a name="index-transient_002dmark_002dmode-2592" id=
  "index-transient_002dmark_002dmode-2592"></a>If
  <code>transient-mark-mode</code> in non-<code>nil</code> and the
  region is active, all articles in the region will be worked
  upon.</p>

  <p>If there is no numeric prefix, but some articles are marked
  with the process mark, perform the operation on the articles
  marked with the process mark.</p>

  <p>If there is neither a numeric prefix nor any articles marked
  with the process mark, just perform the operation on the current
  article.</p>

  <p>Quite simple, really, but it needs to be made clear so that
  surprises are avoided.</p>

  <p>Commands that react to the process mark will push the current
  list of process marked articles onto a stack and will then clear
  all process marked articles. You can restore the previous
  configuration with the <kbd>M P y</kbd> command (see <a href=
  "Setting-Process-Marks.html#Setting-Process-Marks">Setting
  Process Marks</a>).</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dgoto_002dunread-2593" id=
  "index-gnus_002dsummary_002dgoto_002dunread-2593"></a>One thing
  that seems to shock &amp; horrify lots of people is that, for
  instance, <kbd>3 d</kbd> does exactly the same as <kbd>d</kbd>
  <kbd>d</kbd> <kbd>d</kbd>. Since each <kbd>d</kbd> (which marks
  the current article as read) by default goes to the next unread
  article after marking, this means that <kbd>3 d</kbd> will mark
  the next three unread articles as read, no matter what the
  summary buffer looks like. Set
  <code>gnus-summary-goto-unread</code> to <code>nil</code> for a
  more straightforward action.</p>

  <p>Many commands do not use the process/prefix convention. All
  commands that do explicitly say so in this manual. To apply the
  process/prefix convention to commands that do not use it, you can
  use the <kbd>M-&amp;</kbd> command. For instance, to mark all the
  articles in the group as expirable, you could say <kbd>M P b
  M-&amp; E</kbd>.</p>
