  "index-unsolicited-commercial-email-2715"></a> First, some
  background on spam.</p>

  <p>If you have access to e-mail, you are familiar with spam
  (technically termed <acronym>UCE</acronym>, Unsolicited
  Commercial E-mail). Simply put, it exists because e-mail delivery
  is very cheap compared to paper mail, so only a very small
  percentage of people need to respond to an UCE to make it
  worthwhile to the advertiser. Ironically, one of the most common
  spams is the one offering a database of e-mail addresses for
  further spamming. Senders of spam are usually called
  <em>spammers</em>, but terms like <em>vermin</em>, <em>scum</em>,
  <em>sociopaths</em>, and <em>morons</em> are in common use as
  well.</p>

  <p>Spam comes from a wide variety of sources. It is simply
  impossible to dispose of all spam without discarding useful
  messages. A good example is the TMDA system, which requires
  senders unknown to you to confirm themselves as legitimate
  senders before their e-mail can reach you. Without getting into
  the technical side of TMDA, a downside is clearly that e-mail
  from legitimate sources may be discarded if those sources can't
  or won't confirm themselves through the TMDA system. Another
  problem with TMDA is that it requires its users to have a basic
  understanding of e-mail delivery and processing.</p>

  <p>The simplest approach to filtering spam is filtering, at the
  mail server or when you sort through incoming mail. If you get
  200 spam messages per day from &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">random-address@vmadmin.com</span></samp>&rsquo;, you block
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vmadmin.com</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  If you get 200 messages about &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">VIAGRA</span></samp>&rsquo;, you discard all messages with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VIAGRA</span></samp>&rsquo; in
  the message. If you get lots of spam from Bulgaria, for example,
  you try to filter all mail from Bulgarian IPs.</p>

  <p>This, unfortunately, is a great way to discard legitimate
  e-mail. The risks of blocking a whole country (Bulgaria, Norway,
  Nigeria, China, etc.) or even a continent (Asia, Africa, Europe,
  etc.) from contacting you should be obvious, so don't do it if
  you have the choice.</p>

  <p>In another instance, the very informative and useful RISKS
  digest has been blocked by overzealous mail filters because it
  <strong>contained</strong> words that were common in spam
  messages. Nevertheless, in isolated cases, with great care,
  direct filtering of mail can be useful.</p>

  <p>Another approach to filtering e-mail is the distributed spam
  processing, for instance DCC implements such a system. In
  essence, <var>N</var> systems around the world agree that a
  machine <var>X</var> in Ghana, Estonia, or California is sending
  out spam e-mail, and these <var>N</var> systems enter
  <var>X</var> or the spam e-mail from <var>X</var> into a
  database. The criteria for spam detection vary&mdash;it may be
  the number of messages sent, the content of the messages, and so
  on. When a user of the distributed processing system wants to
  find out if a message is spam, he consults one of those
  <var>N</var> systems.</p>

  <p>Distributed spam processing works very well against spammers
  that send a large number of messages at once, but it requires the
  user to set up fairly complicated checks. There are commercial
  and free distributed spam processing systems. Distributed spam
  processing has its risks as well. For instance legitimate e-mail
  senders have been accused of sending spam, and their web sites
  and mailing lists have been shut down for some time because of
  the incident.</p>

  <p>The statistical approach to spam filtering is also popular. It
  is based on a statistical analysis of previous spam messages.
  Usually the analysis is a simple word frequency count, with
  perhaps pairs of words or 3-word combinations thrown into the
  mix. Statistical analysis of spam works very well in most of the
  cases, but it can classify legitimate e-mail as spam in some
  cases. It takes time to run the analysis, the full message must
  be analyzed, and the user has to store the database of spam
  analysis. Statistical analysis on the server is gaining
  popularity. This has the advantage of letting the user Just Read
  Mail, but has the disadvantage that it's harder to tell the
  server that it has misclassified mail.</p>

  <p>Fighting spam is not easy, no matter what anyone says. There
  is no magic switch that will distinguish Viagra ads from Mom's
  e-mails. Even people are having a hard time telling spam apart
  from non-spam, because spammers are actively looking to fool us
  into thinking they are Mom, essentially. Spamming is irritating,
  irresponsible, and idiotic behavior from a bunch of people who
  think the world owes them a favor. We hope the following sections
  will help you in fighting the spam plague.</p>
