  "index-unsolicited-commercial-email-2710"></a> In these last days
  of the Usenet, commercial vultures are hanging about and grepping
  through news like crazy to find email addresses they can foist
  off their scams and products to. As a reaction to this, many
  people have started putting nonsense addresses into their
  <code>From</code> lines. I think this is
  counterproductive&mdash;it makes it difficult for people to send
  you legitimate mail in response to things you write, as well as
  making it difficult to see who wrote what. This rewriting may
  perhaps be a bigger menace than the unsolicited commercial email
  itself in the end.</p>

  <p>The biggest problem I have with email spam is that it comes in
  under false pretenses. I press <kbd>g</kbd> and Gnus merrily
  informs me that I have 10 new emails. I say &ldquo;Golly gee!
  Happy is me!&rdquo; and select the mail group, only to find two
  pyramid schemes, seven advertisements (&ldquo;New! Miracle tonic
  for growing full, lustrous hair on your toes!&rdquo;) and one
  mail asking me to repent and find some god.</p>

  <p>This is annoying. Here's what you can do about it.</p>
