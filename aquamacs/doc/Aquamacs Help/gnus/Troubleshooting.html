  <h3 class="section">11.6 Troubleshooting</h3>

  <p><a name="index-troubleshooting-3004" id=
  "index-troubleshooting-3004"></a> Gnus works <em>so</em> well
  straight out of the box&mdash;I can't imagine any problems,
  really.</p>

  <p>Ahem.</p>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>Make sure your computer is switched on.</li>

    <li>Make sure that you really load the current Gnus version. If
    you have been running <span class="sc">gnus</span>, you need to
    exit Emacs and start it up again before Gnus will work.</li>

    <li>Try doing an <kbd>M-x gnus-version</kbd>. If you get
    something that looks like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Gnus
    v5.13</span></samp>&rsquo;
    <!-- Adjust ../Makefile.in if you change this line! -->
     you have the right files loaded. Otherwise you have some old
    <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> files lying around.
    Delete these.</li>

    <li>Read the help group (<kbd>G h</kbd> in the group buffer)
    for a <acronym>FAQ</acronym> and a how-to.</li>

    <li><a name="index-max_002dlisp_002deval_002ddepth-3005" id=
    "index-max_002dlisp_002deval_002ddepth-3005"></a>Gnus works on
    many recursive structures, and in some extreme (and very rare)
    cases Gnus may recurse down &ldquo;too deeply&rdquo; and Emacs
    will beep at you. If this happens to you, set
    <code>max-lisp-eval-depth</code> to 500 or something like
    that.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If all else fails, report the problem as a bug.</p>

  <p><a name="index-bugs-3006" id="index-bugs-3006"></a><a name=
  "index-reporting-bugs-3007" id="index-reporting-bugs-3007"></a>
  <a name="index-M_002dx-gnus_002dbug-3008" id=
  "index-M_002dx-gnus_002dbug-3008"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dbug-3009" id="index-gnus_002dbug-3009"></a>If you
  find a bug in Gnus, you can report it with the <kbd>M-x
  gnus-bug</kbd> command. <kbd>M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error
  RET t RET</kbd>, and send me the backtrace. I will fix bugs, but
  I can only fix them if you send me a precise description as to
  how to reproduce the bug.</p>

  <p>You really can never be too detailed in a bug report. Always
  use the <kbd>M-x gnus-bug</kbd> command when you make bug
  reports, even if it creates a 10Kb mail each time you use it, and
  even if you have sent me your environment 500 times before. I
  don't care. I want the full info each time.</p>

  <p>It is also important to remember that I have no memory
  whatsoever. If you send a bug report, and I send you a reply, and
  then you just send back &ldquo;No, it's not! Moron!&rdquo;, I
  will have no idea what you are insulting me about. Always
  over-explain everything. It's much easier for all of us&mdash;if
  I don't have all the information I need, I will just mail you and
  ask for more info, and everything takes more time.</p>

  <p>If the problem you're seeing is very visual, and you can't
  quite explain it, copy the Emacs window to a file (with
  <code>xwd</code>, for instance), put it somewhere it can be
  reached, and include the URL of the picture in the bug
  report.</p>

  <p><a name="index-patches-3010" id="index-patches-3010"></a>If
  you would like to contribute a patch to fix bugs or make
  improvements, please produce the patch using
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">diff -u</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><a name="index-edebug-3011" id="index-edebug-3011"></a>If you
  want to debug your problem further before reporting, possibly in
  order to solve the problem yourself and send a patch, you can use
  edebug. Debugging Lisp code is documented in the Elisp manual
  (see <a href="../elisp/Debugging.html#Debugging">Debugging Lisp
  Programs</a>). To get you started with edebug, consider if you
  discover some weird behavior when pressing <kbd>c</kbd>, the
  first step is to do <kbd>C-h k c</kbd> and click on the hyperlink
  (Emacs only) in the documentation buffer that leads you to the
  function definition, then press <kbd>M-x edebug-defun RET</kbd>
  with point inside that function, return to Gnus and press
  <kbd>c</kbd> to invoke the code. You will be placed in the lisp
  buffer and can single step using <kbd>SPC</kbd> and evaluate
  expressions using <kbd>M-:</kbd> or inspect variables using
  <kbd>C-h v</kbd>, abort execution with <kbd>q</kbd>, and resume
  execution with <kbd>c</kbd> or <kbd>g</kbd>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-elp-3012" id="index-elp-3012"></a><a name=
  "index-profile-3013" id="index-profile-3013"></a><a name=
  "index-slow-3014" id="index-slow-3014"></a>Sometimes, a problem
  do not directly generate an elisp error but manifests itself by
  causing Gnus to be very slow. In these cases, you can use
  <kbd>M-x toggle-debug-on-quit</kbd> and press <kbd>C-g</kbd> when
  things are slow, and then try to analyze the backtrace (repeating
  the procedure helps isolating the real problem areas).</p>

  <p>A fancier approach is to use the elisp profiler, ELP. The
  profiler is (or should be) fully documented elsewhere, but to get
  you started there are a few steps that need to be followed.
  First, instrument the part of Gnus you are interested in for
  profiling, e.g. <kbd>M-x elp-instrument-package RET gnus</kbd> or
  <kbd>M-x elp-instrument-package RET message</kbd>. Then perform
  the operation that is slow and press <kbd>M-x elp-results</kbd>.
  You will then see which operations that takes time, and can debug
  them further. If the entire operation takes much longer than the
  time spent in the slowest function in the profiler output, you
  probably profiled the wrong part of Gnus. To reset profiling
  statistics, use <kbd>M-x elp-reset-all</kbd>. <kbd>M-x
  elp-restore-all</kbd> is supposed to remove profiling, but given
  the complexities and dynamic code generation in Gnus, it might
  not always work perfectly.</p>

  better off asking on &lsquo;<samp><span class=
