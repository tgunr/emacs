  <h4 class="subsection">11.8.1 Keystrokes</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Q: What is an experienced Emacs user?</li>

    <li>A: A person who wishes that the terminal had pedals.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Yes, when you use Emacs, you are apt to use the control key,
  the shift key and the meta key a lot. This is very annoying to
  some people (notably <code>vi</code>le users), and the rest of us
  just love the hell out of it. Just give up and submit. Emacs
  really does stand for
  &ldquo;Escape-Meta-Alt-Control-Shift&rdquo;, and not
  &ldquo;Editing Macros&rdquo;, as you may have heard from other
  disreputable sources (like the Emacs author).</p>

  <p>The shift keys are normally located near your pinky fingers,
  and are normally used to get capital letters and stuff. You
  probably use it all the time. The control key is normally marked
  &ldquo;CTRL&rdquo; or something like that. The meta key is,
  funnily enough, never marked as such on any keyboard. The one I'm
  currently at has a key that's marked &ldquo;Alt&rdquo;, which is
  the meta key on this keyboard. It's usually located somewhere to
  the left hand side of the keyboard, usually on the bottom
  row.</p>

  <p>Now, us Emacs people don't say &ldquo;press the meta-control-m
  key&rdquo;, because that's just too inconvenient. We say
  &ldquo;press the <kbd>C-M-m</kbd> key&rdquo;. <kbd>M-</kbd> is
  the prefix that means &ldquo;meta&rdquo; and &ldquo;C-&rdquo; is
  the prefix that means &ldquo;control&rdquo;. So &ldquo;press
  <kbd>C-k</kbd>&rdquo; means &ldquo;press down the control key,
  and hold it down while you press <kbd>k</kbd>&rdquo;.
  &ldquo;Press <kbd>C-M-k</kbd>&rdquo; means &ldquo;press down and
  hold down the meta key and the control key and then press
  <kbd>k</kbd>&rdquo;. Simple, ay?</p>

  <p>This is somewhat complicated by the fact that not all
  keyboards have a meta key. In that case you can use the
  &ldquo;escape&rdquo; key. Then <kbd>M-k</kbd> means &ldquo;press
  escape, release escape, press <kbd>k</kbd>&rdquo;. That's much
  more work than if you have a meta key, so if that's the case, I
  respectfully suggest you get a real keyboard with a meta key. You
  can't live without it.</p>
