  <h4 class="subsection">11.2.7 Gnus Development</h4>

  <p>Gnus is developed in a two-phased cycle. The first phase
  involves much discussion on the development mailing list
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">ding@gnus.org</span></samp>&rsquo;, where people propose
  changes and new features, post patches and new back ends. This
  phase is called the <dfn>alpha</dfn> phase, since the Gnusae
  released in this phase are <dfn>alpha releases</dfn>, or (perhaps
  more commonly in other circles) <dfn>snapshots</dfn>. During this
  phase, Gnus is assumed to be unstable and should not be used by
  casual users. Gnus alpha releases have names like &ldquo;Oort
  Gnus&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Gnus&rdquo;. See <a href=
  "Gnus-Versions.html#Gnus-Versions">Gnus Versions</a>.</p>

  <p>After futzing around for 10-100 alpha releases, Gnus is
  declared <dfn>frozen</dfn>, and only bug fixes are applied. Gnus
  loses the prefix, and is called things like &ldquo;Gnus
  5.10.1&rdquo; instead. Normal people are supposed to be able to
  use these, and these are mostly discussed on the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">gnu.emacs.gnus</span></samp>&rsquo; newsgroup. This
  newgroup is mirrored to the mailing list
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info-gnus-english@gnu.org</span></samp>&rsquo;
  which is carried on Gmane as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">gmane.emacs.gnus.user</span></samp>&rsquo;. These releases
  are finally integrated in Emacs.</p>

  "index-mail_002dsource_002ddelete_002dincoming-2952" id=
  "index-mail_002dsource_002ddelete_002dincoming-2952"></a>Some
  variable defaults differ between alpha Gnusae and released
  Gnusae, in particular, <code>mail-source-delete-incoming</code>.
  This is to prevent lossage of mail if an alpha release hiccups
  while handling the mail. See <a href=
  "Mail-Source-Customization.html#Mail-Source-Customization">Mail
  Source Customization</a>.</p>

  <p>The division of discussion between the ding mailing list and
  the Gnus newsgroup is not purely based on publicity concerns.
  It's true that having people write about the horrible things that
  an alpha Gnus release can do (sometimes) in a public forum may
  scare people off, but more importantly, talking about new
  experimental features that have been introduced may confuse
  casual users. New features are frequently introduced, fiddled
  with, and judged to be found wanting, and then either discarded
  or totally rewritten. People reading the mailing list usually
  keep up with these rapid changes, while people on the newsgroup
  can't be assumed to do so.</p>

  <p>So if you have problems with or questions about the alpha
  versions, direct those to the ding mailing list
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">ding@gnus.org</span></samp>&rsquo;. This list is also
  available on Gmane as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">gmane.emacs.gnus.general</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
