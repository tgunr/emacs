  <p><a name="index-group-level-158" id=
  "index-group-level-158"></a><a name="index-level-159" id=
  "index-level-159"></a> All groups have a level of
  <dfn>subscribedness</dfn>. For instance, if a group is on level
  2, it is more subscribed than a group on level 5. You can ask
  Gnus to just list groups on a given level or lower (see <a href=
  "Listing-Groups.html#Listing-Groups">Listing Groups</a>), or to
  just check for new articles in groups on a given level or lower
  (see <a href=
  "Scanning-New-Messages.html#Scanning-New-Messages">Scanning New
  Messages</a>).</p>

  <p>Remember: The higher the level of the group, the less
  important it is.</p>

    the level of the current group. If a numeric prefix is given,
    the next <var>n</var> groups will have their levels set. The
    user will be prompted for a level.</dd>

  "index-gnus_002dlevel_002dsubscribed-165" id=
  "index-gnus_002dlevel_002dsubscribed-165"></a>Gnus considers
  groups from levels 1 to <code>gnus-level-subscribed</code>
  (inclusive) (default 5) to be subscribed,
  <code>gnus-level-subscribed</code> (exclusive) and
  <code>gnus-level-unsubscribed</code> (inclusive) (default 7) to
  be unsubscribed, <code>gnus-level-zombie</code> to be zombies
  (walking dead) (default 8) and <code>gnus-level-killed</code> to
  be killed (completely dead) (default 9). Gnus treats subscribed
  and unsubscribed groups exactly the same, but zombie and killed
  groups have no information on what articles you have read, etc,
  stored. This distinction between dead and living groups isn't
  done because it is nice or clever, it is done purely for reasons
  of efficiency.</p>

  <p>It is recommended that you keep all your mail groups (if any)
  on quite low levels (e.g. 1 or 2).</p>

  <p>Maybe the following description of the default behavior of
  Gnus helps to understand what these levels are all about. By
  default, Gnus shows you subscribed nonempty groups, but by
  hitting <kbd>L</kbd> you can have it show empty subscribed groups
  and unsubscribed groups, too. Type <kbd>l</kbd> to go back to
  showing nonempty subscribed groups again. Thus, unsubscribed
  groups are hidden, in a way.</p>

  <p>Zombie and killed groups are similar to unsubscribed groups in
  that they are hidden by default. But they are different from
  subscribed and unsubscribed groups in that Gnus doesn't ask the
  news server for information (number of messages, number of unread
  messages) on zombie and killed groups. Normally, you use
  <kbd>C-k</kbd> to kill the groups you aren't interested in. If
  most groups are killed, Gnus is faster.</p>

  <p>Why does Gnus distinguish between zombie and killed groups?
  Well, when a new group arrives on the server, Gnus by default
  makes it a zombie group. This means that you are normally not
  bothered with new groups, but you can type <kbd>A z</kbd> to get
  a list of all new groups. Subscribe the ones you like and kill
  the ones you don't want. (<kbd>A k</kbd> shows a list of killed
  groups.)</p>

  <p>If you want to play with the level variables, you should show
  some care. Set them once, and don't touch them ever again. Better
  yet, don't touch them at all unless you know exactly what you're
  doing.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dlevel_002ddefault_002dunsubscribed-166" id=
  "index-gnus_002dlevel_002ddefault_002dunsubscribed-166"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dlevel_002ddefault_002dsubscribed-167"
  id="index-gnus_002dlevel_002ddefault_002dsubscribed-167"></a>Two
  closely related variables are
  <code>gnus-level-default-subscribed</code> (default 3) and
  <code>gnus-level-default-unsubscribed</code> (default 6), which
  are the levels that new groups will be put on if they are
  (un)subscribed. These two variables should, of course, be inside
  the relevant valid ranges.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dkeep_002dsame_002dlevel-168" id=
  "index-gnus_002dkeep_002dsame_002dlevel-168"></a>If
  <code>gnus-keep-same-level</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, some
  movement commands will only move to groups of the same level (or
  lower). In particular, going from the last article in one group
  to the next group will go to the next group of the same level (or
  lower). This might be handy if you want to read the most
  important groups before you read the rest.</p>

  <p>If this variable is <code>best</code>, Gnus will make the next
  newsgroup the one with the best level.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dgroup_002ddefault_002dlist_002dlevel-169" id=
  "index-gnus_002dgroup_002ddefault_002dlist_002dlevel-169"></a>All
  groups with a level less than or equal to
  <code>gnus-group-default-list-level</code> will be listed in the
  group buffer by default. This variable can also be a function. In
  that case, that function will be called and the result will be
  used as value.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dgroup_002dlist_002dinactive_002dgroups-170" id=
  "index-gnus_002dgroup_002dlist_002dinactive_002dgroups-170"></a>If
  <code>gnus-group-list-inactive-groups</code> is
  non-<code>nil</code>, non-active groups will be listed along with
  the unread groups. This variable is <code>t</code> by default. If
  it is <code>nil</code>, inactive groups won't be listed.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dgroup_002duse_002dpermanent_002dlevels-171" id=
  "index-gnus_002dgroup_002duse_002dpermanent_002dlevels-171"></a>If
  <code>gnus-group-use-permanent-levels</code> is
  non-<code>nil</code>, once you give a level prefix to
  <kbd>g</kbd> or <kbd>l</kbd>, all subsequent commands will use
  this level as the &ldquo;work&rdquo; level.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dactivate_002dlevel-172" id=
  "index-gnus_002dactivate_002dlevel-172"></a>Gnus will normally
  just activate (i. e., query the server about) groups on level
  <code>gnus-activate-level</code> or less. If you don't want to
  activate unsubscribed groups, for instance, you might set this
  variable to 5. The default is 6.</p>
