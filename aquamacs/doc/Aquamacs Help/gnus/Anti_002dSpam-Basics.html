  <h4 class="subsection">9.17.2 Anti-Spam Basics</h4>

  <p><a name="index-email-spam-2716" id=
  "index-email-spam-2716"></a><a name="index-spam-2717" id=
  "index-spam-2717"></a><a name="index-UCE-2718" id=
  "index-UCE-2718"></a><a name=
  "index-unsolicited-commercial-email-2719" id=
  "index-unsolicited-commercial-email-2719"></a> One way of dealing
  with spam is having Gnus split out all spam into a
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; mail
  group (see <a href="Splitting-Mail.html#Splitting-Mail">Splitting
  Mail</a>).</p>

  <p>First, pick one (1) valid mail address that you can be reached
  at, and put it in your <code>From</code> header of all your news
  articles. (I've chosen &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no</span></samp>&rsquo;, but for many
  addresses on the form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">larsi+usenet@ifi.uio.no</span></samp>&rsquo; will be a
  better choice. Ask your sysadmin whether your sendmail
  installation accepts keywords in the local part of the mail
  address.)</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq message-default-news-headers
           "From: Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen &lt;larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no&gt;\n")
</pre>

  <p>Then put the following split rule in
  <code>nnmail-split-fancy</code> (see <a href=
  "Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy Mail
  Splitting</a>):</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (...
      (to "larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no"
          (| ("subject" "re:.*" "misc")
             ("references" ".*@.*" "misc")
             "spam"))
      ...)
</pre>

  <p>This says that all mail to this address is suspect, but if it
  has a <code>Subject</code> that starts with a
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Re:</span></samp>&rsquo; or has a
  <code>References</code> header, it's probably ok. All the rest
  goes to the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; group. (This idea probably comes
  from Tim Pierce.)</p>

  <p>In addition, many mail spammers talk directly to your
  <acronym>SMTP</acronym> server and do not include your email
  address explicitly in the <code>To</code> header. Why they do
  this is unknown&mdash;perhaps it's to thwart this thwarting
  scheme? In any case, this is trivial to deal with&mdash;you just
  put anything not addressed to you in the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; group
  by ending your fancy split rule in this way:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (
      ...
      (to "larsi" "misc")
      "spam")
</pre>

  <p>In my experience, this will sort virtually everything into the
  right group. You still have to check the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; group
  from time to time to check for legitimate mail, though. If you
  feel like being a good net citizen, you can even send off
  complaints to the proper authorities on each unsolicited
  commercial email&mdash;at your leisure.</p>

  <p>This works for me. It allows people an easy way to contact me
  (they can just press <kbd>r</kbd> in the usual way), and I'm not
  bothered at all with spam. It's a win-win situation. Forging
  <code>From</code> headers to point to non-existent domains is
  yucky, in my opinion.</p>

  <p>Be careful with this approach. Spammers are wise to it.</p>
