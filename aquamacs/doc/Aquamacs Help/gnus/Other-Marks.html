  <h4 class="subsection">3.7.3 Other Marks</h4>

  <p><a name="index-process-mark-781" id=
  "index-process-mark-781"></a><a name="index-bookmarks-782" id=
  "index-bookmarks-782"></a> There are some marks that have nothing
  to do with whether the article is read or not.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can set a bookmark in the current article. Say you are
    reading a long thesis on cats' urinary tracts, and have to go
    home for dinner before you've finished reading the thesis. You
    can then set a bookmark in the article, and Gnus will jump to
    this bookmark the next time it encounters the article. See
    <a href="Setting-Marks.html#Setting-Marks">Setting
    Marks</a>.</li>

    <li><a name="index-gnus_002dreplied_002dmark-783" id=
    "index-gnus_002dreplied_002dmark-783"></a>All articles that you
    have replied to or made a followup to (i.e., have answered)
    will be marked with an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo; in the second column
    (<code>gnus-replied-mark</code>).</li>

    <li><a name="index-gnus_002dforwarded_002dmark-784" id=
    "index-gnus_002dforwarded_002dmark-784"></a>All articles that
    you have forwarded will be marked with an
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
    second column (<code>gnus-forwarded-mark</code>).</li>

    <li><a name="index-gnus_002dcached_002dmark-785" id=
    "index-gnus_002dcached_002dmark-785"></a>Articles stored in the
    article cache will be marked with an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in the second column
    (<code>gnus-cached-mark</code>). See <a href=
    "Article-Caching.html#Article-Caching">Article
    Caching</a>.</li>

    <li><a name="index-gnus_002dsaved_002dmark-786" id=
    "index-gnus_002dsaved_002dmark-786"></a>Articles
    &ldquo;saved&rdquo; (in some manner or other; not necessarily
    religiously) are marked with an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; in the second column
    (<code>gnus-saved-mark</code>).</li>

    <li><a name="index-gnus_002drecent_002dmark-787" id=
    "index-gnus_002drecent_002dmark-787"></a>Articles that
    according to the server haven't been shown to the user before
    are marked with a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">N</span></samp>&rsquo; in the second column
    (<code>gnus-recent-mark</code>). Note that not all servers
    support this mark, in which case it simply never appears.
    Compare with <code>gnus-unseen-mark</code>.</li>

    <li><a name="index-gnus_002dunseen_002dmark-788" id=
    "index-gnus_002dunseen_002dmark-788"></a>Articles that haven't
    been seen before in Gnus by the user are marked with a
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
    second column (<code>gnus-unseen-mark</code>). Compare with
    <code>gnus-recent-mark</code>.</li>

    <li><a name="index-gnus_002ddownloaded_002dmark-789" id=
    "index-gnus_002ddownloaded_002dmark-789"></a>When using the
    Gnus agent (see <a href="Agent-Basics.html#Agent-Basics">Agent
    Basics</a>), articles may be downloaded for unplugged (offline)
    viewing. If you are using the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; spec, these articles get the
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; mark in
    that spec. (The variable <code>gnus-downloaded-mark</code>
    controls which character to use.)</li>

    <li><a name="index-gnus_002dundownloaded_002dmark-790" id=
    "index-gnus_002dundownloaded_002dmark-790"></a>When using the
    Gnus agent (see <a href="Agent-Basics.html#Agent-Basics">Agent
    Basics</a>), some articles might not have been downloaded. Such
    articles cannot be viewed while you are unplugged (offline). If
    you are using the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; spec, these articles get the
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; mark in
    that spec. (The variable <code>gnus-undownloaded-mark</code>
    controls which character to use.)</li>

    <li><a name="index-gnus_002ddownloadable_002dmark-791" id=
    "index-gnus_002ddownloadable_002dmark-791"></a>The Gnus agent
    (see <a href="Agent-Basics.html#Agent-Basics">Agent Basics</a>)
    downloads some articles automatically, but it is also possible
    to explicitly mark articles for download, even if they would
    not be downloaded automatically. Such explicitly-marked
    articles get the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; mark in the first column. (The
    variable <code>gnus-downloadable-mark</code> controls which
    character to use.)</li>

    <li><a name=
    "index-gnus_002dnot_002dempty_002dthread_002dmark-792" id=
    "index-gnus_002dnot_002dempty_002dthread_002dmark-792"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dempty_002dthread_002dmark-793"
    id="index-gnus_002dempty_002dthread_002dmark-793"></a>If the
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>&rsquo; spec is
    used, the presence of threads or not will be marked with
    <code>gnus-not-empty-thread-mark</code> and
    <code>gnus-empty-thread-mark</code> in the third column,
    respectively.</li>

    <li><a name="index-gnus_002dprocess_002dmark-794" id=
    "index-gnus_002dprocess_002dmark-794"></a>Finally we have the
    <dfn>process mark</dfn> (<code>gnus-process-mark</code>). A
    variety of commands react to the presence of the process mark.
    For instance, <kbd>X u</kbd> (<code>gnus-uu-decode-uu</code>)
    will uudecode and view all articles that have been marked with
    the process mark. Articles marked with the process mark have a
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
    second column.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You might have noticed that most of these
  &ldquo;non-readedness&rdquo; marks appear in the second column by
  default. So if you have a cached, saved, replied article that you
  have process-marked, what will that look like?</p>

  <p>Nothing much. The precedence rules go as follows: process
  -&gt; cache -&gt; replied -&gt; saved. So if the article is in
  the cache and is replied, you'll only see the cache mark and not
  the replied mark.</p>
