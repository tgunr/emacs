  <h3 class="section">3.12 Article Caching</h3>

  <p><a name="index-article-caching-1051" id=
  "index-article-caching-1051"></a><a name="index-caching-1052" id=
  "index-caching-1052"></a> If you have an <em>extremely</em> slow
  <acronym>NNTP</acronym> connection, you may consider turning
  article caching on. Each article will then be stored locally
  under your home directory. As you may surmise, this could
  potentially use <em>huge</em> amounts of disk space, as well as
  eat up all your inodes so fast it will make your head swim. In
  vodka.</p>

  <p>Used carefully, though, it could be just an easier way to save
  articles.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002duse_002dlong_002dfile_002dname-1053"
  id=
  "index-gnus_002duse_002dlong_002dfile_002dname-1053"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dcache_002ddirectory-1054" id=
  "index-gnus_002dcache_002ddirectory-1054"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002duse_002dcache-1055" id=
  "index-gnus_002duse_002dcache-1055"></a>To turn caching on, set
  <code>gnus-use-cache</code> to <code>t</code>. By default, all
  articles ticked or marked as dormant will then be copied over to
  your local cache (<code>gnus-cache-directory</code>). Whether
  this cache is flat or hierarchical is controlled by the
  <code>gnus-use-long-file-name</code> variable, as usual.</p>

  <p>When re-selecting a ticked or dormant article, it will be
  fetched from the cache instead of from the server. As articles in
  your cache will never expire, this might serve as a method of
  saving articles while still keeping them where they belong. Just
  mark all articles you want to save as dormant, and don't
  worry.</p>

  <p>When an article is marked as read, is it removed from the
  cache.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dcache_002dremove_002darticles-1056"
  id="index-gnus_002dcache_002dremove_002darticles-1056"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dcache_002denter_002darticles-1057"
  id="index-gnus_002dcache_002denter_002darticles-1057"></a>The
  entering/removal of articles from the cache is controlled by the
  <code>gnus-cache-enter-articles</code> and
  <code>gnus-cache-remove-articles</code> variables. Both are lists
  of symbols. The first is <code>(ticked dormant)</code> by
  default, meaning that ticked and dormant articles will be put in
  the cache. The latter is <code>(read)</code> by default, meaning
  that articles marked as read are removed from the cache. Possibly
  symbols in these two lists are <code>ticked</code>,
  <code>dormant</code>, <code>unread</code> and
  <code>read</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002djog_002dcache-1058" id=
  "index-gnus_002djog_002dcache-1058"></a>So where does the massive
  article-fetching and storing come into the picture? The
  <code>gnus-jog-cache</code> command will go through all
  subscribed newsgroups, request all unread articles, score them,
  and store them in the cache. You should only ever, ever ever
  ever, use this command if 1) your connection to the
  <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server is really, really, really slow and
  2) you have a really, really, really huge disk. Seriously. One
  way to cut down on the number of articles downloaded is to score
  unwanted articles down and have them marked as read. They will
  not then be downloaded by this command.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002duncacheable_002dgroups-1059" id=
  "index-gnus_002duncacheable_002dgroups-1059"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dcacheable_002dgroups-1060" id=
  "index-gnus_002dcacheable_002dgroups-1060"></a>It is likely that
  you do not want caching on all groups. For instance, if your
  <code>nnml</code> mail is located under your home directory, it
  makes no sense to cache it somewhere else under your home
  directory. Unless you feel that it's neat to use twice as much
  space.</p>

  <p>To limit the caching, you could set
  <code>gnus-cacheable-groups</code> to a regexp of groups to
  cache, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^nntp</span></samp>&rsquo;
  for instance, or set the <code>gnus-uncacheable-groups</code>
  regexp to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">^nnml</span></samp>&rsquo;, for instance. Both variables
  are <code>nil</code> by default. If a group matches both
  variables, the group is not cached.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dcache_002dgenerate_002dnov_002ddatabases-1061"
  id="index-gnus_002dcache_002dgenerate_002dnov_002ddatabases-1061">
  </a><a name="index-gnus_002dcache_002dgenerate_002dactive-1062"
  id=
  "index-gnus_002dcache_002dgenerate_002dactive-1062"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dcache_002dactive_002dfile-1063" id=
  "index-gnus_002dcache_002dactive_002dfile-1063"></a>The cache
  stores information on what articles it contains in its active
  file (<code>gnus-cache-active-file</code>). If this file (or any
  other parts of the cache) becomes all messed up for some reason
  or other, Gnus offers two functions that will try to set things
  right. <kbd>M-x gnus-cache-generate-nov-databases</kbd> will
  (re)build all the <acronym>NOV</acronym> files, and
  <kbd>gnus-cache-generate-active</kbd> will (re)generate the
  active file.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dcache_002dmove_002dcache-1064" id=
  "index-gnus_002dcache_002dmove_002dcache-1064"></a><code>gnus-cache-move-cache</code>
  will move your whole <code>gnus-cache-directory</code> to some
  other location. You get asked to where, isn't that cool?</p>
