  <h3 class="section">9.11 Undo</h3>

  <p><a name="index-undo-2655" id="index-undo-2655"></a> It is very
  useful to be able to undo actions one has done. In normal Emacs
  buffers, it's easy enough&mdash;you just push the
  <code>undo</code> button. In Gnus buffers, however, it isn't that
  simple.</p>

  <p>The things Gnus displays in its buffer is of no value
  whatsoever to Gnus&mdash;it's all just data designed to look nice
  to the user. Killing a group in the group buffer with
  <kbd>C-k</kbd> makes the line disappear, but that's just a
  side-effect of the real action&mdash;the removal of the group in
  question from the internal Gnus structures. Undoing something
  like that can't be done by the normal Emacs <code>undo</code>
  function.</p>

  <p>Gnus tries to remedy this somewhat by keeping track of what
  the user does and coming up with actions that would reverse the
  actions the user takes. When the user then presses the
  <code>undo</code> key, Gnus will run the code to reverse the
  previous action, or the previous actions. However, not all
  actions are easily reversible, so Gnus currently offers a few key
  functions to be undoable. These include killing groups, yanking
  groups, and changing the list of read articles of groups. That's
  it, really. More functions may be added in the future, but each
  added function means an increase in data to be stored, so Gnus
  will never be totally undoable.</p>

  "index-gnus_002dundo_002dmode-2656"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002duse_002dundo-2657" id=
  "index-gnus_002duse_002dundo-2657"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dundo-2658" id="index-gnus_002dundo-2658"></a>The
  undoability is provided by the <code>gnus-undo-mode</code> minor
  mode. It is used if <code>gnus-use-undo</code> is
  non-<code>nil</code>, which is the default. The <kbd>C-M-_</kbd>
  key performs the <code>gnus-undo</code> command, which should
  feel kinda like the normal Emacs <code>undo</code> command.</p>
