  <h3 class="section">1.6 Startup Files</h3>

  <p><a name="index-startup-files-41" id=
  "index-startup-files-41"></a><a name="index-g_t_002enewsrc-42"
  id="index-g_t_002enewsrc-42"></a><a name=
  "index-g_t_002enewsrc_002eel-43" id=
  "index-g_t_002enewsrc_002eel-43"></a><a name=
  "index-g_t_002enewsrc_002eeld-44" id=
  "index-g_t_002enewsrc_002eeld-44"></a> Most common Unix news
  readers use a shared startup file called <samp><span class=
  "file">.newsrc</span></samp>. This file contains all the
  information about what groups are subscribed, and which articles
  in these groups have been read.</p>

  <p>Things got a bit more complicated with <span class=
  "sc">gnus</span>. In addition to keeping the <samp><span class=
  "file">.newsrc</span></samp> file updated, it also used a file
  called <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.el</span></samp> for
  storing all the information that didn't fit into the
  <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file. (Actually,
  it also duplicated everything in the <samp><span class=
  "file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.) <span class="sc">gnus</span>
  would read whichever one of these files was the most recently
  saved, which enabled people to swap between <span class=
  "sc">gnus</span> and other newsreaders.</p>

  <p>That was kinda silly, so Gnus went one better: In addition to
  the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> and
  <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.el</span></samp> files, Gnus
  also has a file called <samp><span class=
  "file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp>. It will read whichever of these
  files that are most recent, but it will never write a
  <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.el</span></samp> file. You
  should never delete the <samp><span class=
  "file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp> file&mdash;it contains much
  information not stored in the <samp><span class=
  "file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dnewsrc_002dfile-45" id=
  "index-gnus_002dsave_002dnewsrc_002dfile-45"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dread_002dnewsrc_002dfile-46" id=
  "index-gnus_002dread_002dnewsrc_002dfile-46"></a>You can turn off
  writing the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file
  by setting <code>gnus-save-newsrc-file</code> to
  <code>nil</code>, which means you can delete the file and save
  some space, as well as exiting from Gnus faster. However, this
  will make it impossible to use other newsreaders than Gnus. But
  hey, who would want to, right? Similarly, setting
  <code>gnus-read-newsrc-file</code> to <code>nil</code> makes Gnus
  ignore the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file
  and any <samp><span class="file">.newsrc-SERVER</span></samp>
  files, which can be convenient if you use a different news reader
  occasionally, and you want to read a different subset of the
  available groups with that news reader.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dkilled_002dlist-47" id=
  "index-gnus_002dsave_002dkilled_002dlist-47"></a>If
  <code>gnus-save-killed-list</code> (default <code>t</code>) is
  <code>nil</code>, Gnus will not save the list of killed groups to
  the startup file. This will save both time (when starting and
  quitting) and space (on disk). It will also mean that Gnus has no
  record of what groups are new or old, so the automatic new groups
  subscription methods become meaningless. You should always set
  <code>gnus-check-new-newsgroups</code> to <code>nil</code> or
  <code>ask-server</code> if you set this variable to
  <code>nil</code> (see <a href="New-Groups.html#New-Groups">New
  Groups</a>). This variable can also be a regular expression. If
  that's the case, remove all groups that do not match this regexp
  before saving. This can be useful in certain obscure situations
  that involve several servers where not all servers support
  <code>ask-server</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dstartup_002dfile-48" id=
  "index-gnus_002dstartup_002dfile-48"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dbackup_002dstartup_002dfile-49" id=
  "index-gnus_002dbackup_002dstartup_002dfile-49"></a><a name=
  "index-version_002dcontrol-50" id=
  "index-version_002dcontrol-50"></a>The
  <code>gnus-startup-file</code> variable says where the startup
  files are. The default value is <samp><span class=
  "file">~/.newsrc</span></samp>, with the Gnus (El Dingo) startup
  file being whatever that one is, with a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">.eld</span></samp>&rsquo; appended. If you want version
  control for this file, set <code>gnus-backup-startup-file</code>.
  It respects the same values as the <code>version-control</code>
  variable.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dnewsrc_002dhook-51" id=
  "index-gnus_002dsave_002dnewsrc_002dhook-51"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dsave_002dquick_002dnewsrc_002dhook-52" id=
  "index-gnus_002dsave_002dquick_002dnewsrc_002dhook-52"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dstandard_002dnewsrc_002dhook-53"
  id=
  "index-gnus_002dsave_002dstandard_002dnewsrc_002dhook-53"></a><code>gnus-save-newsrc-hook</code>
  is called before saving any of the newsrc files, while
  <code>gnus-save-quick-newsrc-hook</code> is called just before
  saving the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp>
  file, and <code>gnus-save-standard-newsrc-hook</code> is called
  just before saving the <samp><span class=
  "file">.newsrc</span></samp> file. The latter two are commonly
  used to turn version control on or off. Version control is on by
  default when saving the startup files. If you want to turn backup
  creation off, say something like:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (defun turn-off-backup ()
       (set (make-local-variable 'backup-inhibited) t))

     (add-hook 'gnus-save-quick-newsrc-hook 'turn-off-backup)
     (add-hook 'gnus-save-standard-newsrc-hook 'turn-off-backup)
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dinit_002dfile-54" id=
  "index-gnus_002dinit_002dfile-54"></a><a name=
  "index-gnus_002dsite_002dinit_002dfile-55" id=
  "index-gnus_002dsite_002dinit_002dfile-55"></a>When Gnus starts,
  it will read the <code>gnus-site-init-file</code>
  (<samp><span class="file">.../site-lisp/gnus-init</span></samp>
  by default) and <code>gnus-init-file</code> (<samp><span class=
  "file">~/.gnus</span></samp> by default) files. These are normal
  Emacs Lisp files and can be used to avoid cluttering your
  <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> and
  <samp><span class="file">site-init</span></samp> files with Gnus
  stuff. Gnus will also check for files with the same names as
  these, but with <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> and
  <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> suffixes. In other
  words, if you have set <code>gnus-init-file</code> to
  <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus</span></samp>, it will look for
  <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.elc</span></samp>,
  <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp>, and finally
  <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus</span></samp> (in this order).
  If Emacs was invoked with the <samp><span class=
  "option">-q</span></samp> or <samp><span class=
  "option">--no-init-file</span></samp> options (see <a href=
  "../emacs/Initial-Options.html#Initial-Options">Initial
  Options</a>), Gnus doesn't read <code>gnus-init-file</code>.</p>
