  <h4 class="subsection">9.18.2 Filtering Incoming Mail</h4>

  <p><a name="index-spam-filtering-2744" id=
  "index-spam-filtering-2744"></a><a name=
  "index-spam-filtering-incoming-mail-2745" id=
  "index-spam-filtering-incoming-mail-2745"></a><a name=
  "index-spam-2746" id="index-spam-2746"></a> To use the Spam
  package to filter incoming mail, you must first set up fancy mail
  splitting. See <a href=
  "Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy Mail
  Splitting</a>. The Spam package defines a special splitting
  function that you can add to your fancy split variable (either
  <code>nnmail-split-fancy</code> or
  <code>nnimap-split-fancy</code>, depending on your mail back
  end):</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (: spam-split)
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-spam_002dsplit_002dgroup-2747" id=
  "index-spam_002dsplit_002dgroup-2747"></a>The
  <code>spam-split</code> function scans incoming mail according to
  your chosen spam back end(s), and sends messages identified as
  spam to a spam group. By default, the spam group is a group named
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo;, but
  you can change this by customizing <code>spam-split-group</code>.
  Make sure the contents of <code>spam-split-group</code> are an
  unqualified group name. For instance, in an <code>nnimap</code>
  server &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">your-server</span></samp>&rsquo;, the value
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; means
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">nnimap+your-server:spam</span></samp>&rsquo;. The value
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">nnimap+server:spam</span></samp>&rsquo; is therefore
  wrong&mdash;it gives the group &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">nnimap+your-server:nnimap+server:spam</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><code>spam-split</code> does not modify the contents of
  messages in any way.</p>

  <p><a name="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002ddownload_002dbody-2748"
  id="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002ddownload_002dbody-2748"></a>Note
  for IMAP users: if you use the
  <code>spam-check-bogofilter</code>,
  <code>spam-check-ifile</code>, and <code>spam-check-stat</code>
  spam back ends, you should also set the variable
  <code>nnimap-split-download-body</code> to <code>t</code>. These
  spam back ends are most useful when they can &ldquo;scan&rdquo;
  the full message body. By default, the nnimap back end only
  retrieves the message headers;
  <code>nnimap-split-download-body</code> tells it to retrieve the
  message bodies as well. We don't set this by default because it
  will slow <acronym>IMAP</acronym> down, and that is not an
  appropriate decision to make on behalf of the user. See <a href=
  "Client_002dSide-IMAP-Splitting.html#Client_002dSide-IMAP-Splitting">
  Client-Side IMAP Splitting</a>.</p>

  <p>You have to specify one or more spam back ends for
  <code>spam-split</code> to use, by setting the
  <code>spam-use-*</code> variables. See <a href=
  "Spam-Back-Ends.html#Spam-Back-Ends">Spam Back Ends</a>.
  Normally, <code>spam-split</code> simply uses all the spam back
  ends you enabled in this way. However, you can tell
  <code>spam-split</code> to use only some of them. Why this is
  useful? Suppose you are using the
  <code>spam-use-regex-headers</code> and
  <code>spam-use-blackholes</code> spam back ends, and the
  following split rule:</p>
  <pre class="example">
      nnimap-split-fancy '(|
                           (any "ding" "ding")
                           (: spam-split)
                           ;; <span class=
"roman">default mailbox</span>
                           "mail")
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The problem is that you want all ding
  messages to make it to the ding folder. But that will let obvious
  spam (for example, spam detected by SpamAssassin, and
  <code>spam-use-regex-headers</code>) through, when it's sent to
  the ding list. On the other hand, some messages to the ding list
  are from a mail server in the blackhole list, so the invocation
  of <code>spam-split</code> can't be before the ding rule.</p>

  <p>The solution is to let SpamAssassin headers supersede ding
  rules, and perform the other <code>spam-split</code> rules
  (including a second invocation of the regex-headers check) after
  the ding rule. This is done by passing a parameter to
  <code>spam-split</code>:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     nnimap-split-fancy
           '(|
             ;; <span class=
"roman">spam detected by </span><code>spam-use-regex-headers</code><span class="roman"> goes to &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">regex-spam</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;</span>
             (: spam-split "regex-spam" 'spam-use-regex-headers)
             (any "ding" "ding")
             ;; <span class=
"roman">all other spam detected by spam-split goes to </span><code>spam-split-group</code>
             (: spam-split)
             ;; <span class="roman">default mailbox</span>
             "mail")
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">This lets you invoke specific
  <code>spam-split</code> checks depending on your particular
  needs, and target the results of those checks to a particular
  spam group. You don't have to throw all mail into all the spam
  tests. Another reason why this is nice is that messages to
  mailing lists you have rules for don't have to have
  resource-intensive blackhole checks performed on them. You could
  also specify different spam checks for your nnmail split vs. your
  nnimap split. Go crazy.</p>

  <p>You should set the <code>spam-use-*</code> variables for
  whatever spam back ends you intend to use. The reason is that
  when loading <samp><span class="file">spam.el</span></samp>, some
  conditional loading is done depending on what
  <code>spam-use-xyz</code> variables you have set. See <a href=
  "Spam-Back-Ends.html#Spam-Back-Ends">Spam Back Ends</a>.
