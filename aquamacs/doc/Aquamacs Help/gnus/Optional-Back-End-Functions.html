  <h5 class="subsubsection">11.7.2.2 Optional Back End
  Functions</h5>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>(nnchoke-retrieve-groups GROUPS &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <var>groups</var> is a list of groups, and this function
      should request data on all those groups. How it does it is of
      no concern to Gnus, but it should attempt to do this in a
      speedy fashion.

      <p>The return value of this function can be either
      <code>active</code> or <code>group</code>, which says what
      the format of the result data is. The former is in the same
      format as the data from <code>nnchoke-request-list</code>,
      while the latter is a buffer full of lines in the same format
      as <code>nnchoke-request-group</code> gives.</p>
      <pre class="example">
          group-buffer = *active-line / *group-status
</pre><br />
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-update-info GROUP INFO &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      A Gnus group info (see <a href=
      "Group-Info.html#Group-Info">Group Info</a>) is handed to the
      back end for alterations. This comes in handy if the back end
      really carries all the information (as is the case with
      virtual and imap groups). This function should destructively
      alter the info to suit its needs, and should return a
      non-<code>nil</code> value (exceptionally,
      <code>nntp-request-update-info</code> always returns
      <code>nil</code> not to waste the network resources).

      <p>There should be no result data from this
      function.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-type GROUP &amp;optional
    ARTICLE)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      When the user issues commands for &ldquo;sending news&rdquo;
      (<kbd>F</kbd> in the summary buffer, for instance), Gnus has
      to know whether the article the user is following up on is
      news or mail. This function should return <code>news</code>
      if <var>article</var> in <var>group</var> is news,
      <code>mail</code> if it is mail and <code>unknown</code> if
      the type can't be decided. (The <var>article</var> parameter
      is necessary in <code>nnvirtual</code> groups which might
      very well combine mail groups and news groups.) Both
      <var>group</var> and <var>article</var> may be
      <code>nil</code>.

      <p>There should be no result data from this
      function.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-set-mark GROUP ACTION &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Set/remove/add marks on articles. Normally Gnus handles the
      article marks (such as read, ticked, expired etc) internally,
      and store them in <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.newsrc.eld</span></samp>. Some back ends (such as
      <acronym>IMAP</acronym>) however carry all information about
      the articles on the server, so Gnus need to propagate the
      mark information to the server.

      <p><var>action</var> is a list of mark setting requests,
      having this format:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (RANGE ACTION MARK)
</pre>

      <p><var>range</var> is a range of articles you wish to update
      marks on. <var>action</var> is <code>add</code> or
      <code>del</code>, used to add marks or remove marks
      (preserving all marks not mentioned). <var>mark</var> is a
      list of marks; where each mark is a symbol. Currently used
      marks are <code>read</code>, <code>tick</code>,
      <code>reply</code>, <code>expire</code>, <code>killed</code>,
      <code>dormant</code>, <code>save</code>,
      <code>download</code>, <code>unsend</code>,
      <code>forward</code> and <code>recent</code>, but your back
      end should, if possible, not limit itself to these.</p>

      <p>Given contradictory actions, the last action in the list
      should be the effective one. That is, if your action contains
      a request to add the <code>tick</code> mark on article 1 and,
      later in the list, a request to remove the mark on the same
      article, the mark should in fact be removed.</p>

      <p>An example action list:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (((5 12 30) 'del '(tick))
           ((10 . 90) 'add '(read expire))
           ((92 94) 'del '(read)))
</pre>

      <p>The function should return a range of articles it wasn't
      able to set the mark on (currently not used for
      anything).</p>

      <p>There should be no result data from this
      function.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-update-mark GROUP ARTICLE
    MARK)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      If the user tries to set a mark that the back end doesn't
      like, this function may change the mark. Gnus will use
      whatever this function returns as the mark for
      <var>article</var> instead of the original <var>mark</var>.
      If the back end doesn't care, it must return the original
      <var>mark</var>, and not <code>nil</code> or any other type
      of garbage.

      <p>The only use for this I can see is what
      <code>nnvirtual</code> does with it&mdash;if a component
      group is auto-expirable, marking an article as read in the
      virtual group should result in the article being marked as
      expirable.</p>

      <p>There should be no result data from this
      function.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-scan &amp;optional GROUP
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function may be called at any time (by Gnus or anything
      else) to request that the back end check for incoming
      articles, in one way or another. A mail back end will
      typically read the spool file or query the
      <acronym>POP</acronym> server when this function is invoked.
      The <var>group</var> doesn't have to be heeded&mdash;if the
      back end decides that it is too much work just scanning for a
      single group, it may do a total scan of all groups. It would
      be nice, however, to keep things local if that's practical.

      <p>There should be no result data from this
      function.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-group-description GROUP
    &amp;optional SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      The result data from this function should be a description of
      <var>group</var>.
      <pre class="example">
          description-line = name &lt;TAB&gt; description eol
          name             = &lt;string&gt;
          description      = &lt;text&gt;
</pre><br />
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-list-newsgroups &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      The result data from this function should be the description
      of all groups available on the server.
      <pre class="example">
          description-buffer = *description-line
</pre><br />
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-newgroups DATE &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      The result data from this function should be all groups that
      were created after &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">date</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is in normal
      human-readable date format (i.e., the date format used in
      mail and news headers, and returned by the function
      <code>message-make-date</code> by default). The data should
      be in the active buffer format.

      <p>It is okay for this function to return &ldquo;too
      many&rdquo; groups; some back ends might find it cheaper to
      return the full list of groups, rather than just the new
      groups. But don't do this for back ends with many groups.
      Normally, if the user creates the groups herself, there won't
      be too many groups, so <code>nnml</code> and the like are
      probably safe. But for back ends like <code>nntp</code>,
      where the groups have been created by the server, it is quite
      likely that there can be many groups.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-create-group GROUP &amp;optional
    SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function should create an empty group with name
      <var>group</var>.

      <p>There should be no return data.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-expire-articles ARTICLES
    &amp;optional GROUP SERVER FORCE)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function should run the expiry process on all articles
      in the <var>articles</var> range (which is currently a simple
      list of article numbers.) It is left up to the back end to
      decide how old articles should be before they are removed by
      this function. If <var>force</var> is non-<code>nil</code>,
      all <var>articles</var> should be deleted, no matter how new
      they are.

      <p>This function should return a list of articles that it did
      not/was not able to delete.</p>

      <p>There should be no result data returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-move-article ARTICLE GROUP SERVER
    ACCEPT-FORM &amp;optional LAST)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function should move <var>article</var> (which is a
      number) from <var>group</var> by calling
      <var>accept-form</var>.

      <p>This function should ready the article in question for
      moving by removing any header lines it has added to the
      article, and generally should &ldquo;tidy up&rdquo; the
      article. Then it should <code>eval</code>
      <var>accept-form</var> in the buffer where the
      &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; article is. This will do the actual
      copying. If this <code>eval</code> returns a
      non-<code>nil</code> value, the article should be
      removed.</p>

      <p>If <var>last</var> is <code>nil</code>, that means that
      there is a high likelihood that there will be more requests
      issued shortly, so that allows some optimizations.</p>

      <p>The function should return a cons where the
      <code>car</code> is the group name and the <code>cdr</code>
      is the article number that the article was entered as.</p>

      <p>There should be no data returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-accept-article GROUP &amp;optional
    SERVER LAST)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function takes the current buffer and inserts it into
      <var>group</var>. If <var>last</var> in <code>nil</code>,
      that means that there will be more calls to this function in
      short order.

      <p>The function should return a cons where the
      <code>car</code> is the group name and the <code>cdr</code>
      is the article number that the article was entered as.</p>

      <p>The group should exist before the back end is asked to
      accept the article for that group.</p>

      <p>There should be no data returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-replace-article ARTICLE GROUP
    BUFFER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function should remove <var>article</var> (which is a
      number) from <var>group</var> and insert <var>buffer</var>
      there instead.

      <p>There should be no data returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-delete-group GROUP FORCE
    &amp;optional SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function should delete <var>group</var>. If
      <var>force</var>, it should really delete all the articles in
      the group, and then delete the group itself. (If there is
      such a thing as &ldquo;the group itself&rdquo;.)

      <p>There should be no data returned.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>(nnchoke-request-rename-group GROUP NEW-NAME
    &amp;optional SERVER)</code></dt>

    <dd>
      This function should rename <var>group</var> into
      <var>new-name</var>. All articles in <var>group</var> should
      move to <var>new-name</var>.

      <p>There should be no data returned.</p>
