  <h4 class="subsection">6.9.4 Agent Visuals</h4>

  <p>If you open a summary while unplugged and, Gnus knows from the
  group's active range that there are more articles than the
  headers currently stored in the Agent, you may see some articles
  whose subject looks something like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[Undownloaded article #####]</span></samp>&rsquo;. These
  are placeholders for the missing headers. Aside from setting a
  mark, there is not much that can be done with one of these
  placeholders. When Gnus finally gets a chance to fetch the
  group's headers, the placeholders will automatically be replaced
  by the actual headers. You can configure the summary buffer's
  maneuvering to skip over the placeholders if you care (See
  <code>gnus-auto-goto-ignores</code>).</p>

  <p>While it may be obvious to all, the only headers and articles
  available while unplugged are those headers and articles that
  were fetched into the Agent while previously plugged. To put it
  another way, &ldquo;If you forget to fetch something while
  plugged, you might have a less than satisfying unplugged
  session&rdquo;. For this reason, the Agent adds two visual
  effects to your summary buffer. These effects display the
  download status of each article so that you always know which
  articles will be available when unplugged.</p>

  <p>The first visual effect is the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; spec. If you customize
  <code>gnus-summary-line-format</code> to include this specifier,
  you will add a single character field that indicates an article's
  download status. Articles that have been fetched into either the
  Agent or the Cache, will display
  <code>gnus-downloaded-mark</code> (defaults to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;). All
  other articles will display <code>gnus-undownloaded-mark</code>
  (defaults to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;). If you open a group that has not
  been agentized, a space (&lsquo; &rsquo;) will be displayed.</p>

  <p>The second visual effect are the undownloaded faces. The
  faces, there are three indicating the article's score (low,
  normal, high), seem to result in a love/hate response from many
  Gnus users. The problem is that the face selection is controlled
  by a list of condition tests and face names (See
  <code>gnus-summary-highlight</code>). Each condition is tested in
  the order in which it appears in the list so early conditions
  have precedence over later conditions. All of this means that, if
  you tick an undownloaded article, the article will continue to be
  displayed in the undownloaded face rather than the ticked
  face.</p>

  <p>If you use the Agent as a cache (to avoid downloading the same
  article each time you visit it or to minimize your connection
  time), the undownloaded face will probably seem like a good idea.
  The reason being that you do all of our work (marking, reading,
  deleting) with downloaded articles so the normal faces always
  appear. For those users using the agent to improve online
  performance by caching the NOV database (most users since
  5.10.2), the undownloaded faces may appear to be an absolutely
  horrible idea. The issue being that, since none of their articles
  have been fetched into the Agent, all of the normal faces will be
  obscured by the undownloaded faces.</p>

  <p>If you would like to use the undownloaded faces, you must
  enable the undownloaded faces by setting the
  <code>agent-enable-undownloaded-faces</code> group parameter to
  <code>t</code>. This parameter, like all other agent parameters,
  may be set on an Agent Category (see <a href=
  "Agent-Categories.html#Agent-Categories">Agent Categories</a>), a
  Group Topic (see <a href=
  "Topic-Parameters.html#Topic-Parameters">Topic Parameters</a>),
  or an individual group (see <a href=
  "Group-Parameters.html#Group-Parameters">Group
  Parameters</a>).</p>

  <p>The one problem common to all users using the agent is how
  quickly it can consume disk space. If you using the agent on many
  groups, it is even more difficult to effectively recover disk
  space. One solution is the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">%F</span></samp>&rsquo; format available in
  <code>gnus-group-line-format</code>. This format will display the
  actual disk space used by articles fetched into both the agent
  and cache. By knowing which groups use the most space, users know
  where to focus their efforts when &ldquo;agent expiring&rdquo;
  articles.</p>
