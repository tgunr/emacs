  <h4 class="subsection">1.4.1 Checking New Groups</h4>

  <p>Gnus normally determines whether a group is new or not by
  comparing the list of groups from the active file(s) with the
  lists of subscribed and dead groups. This isn't a particularly
  fast method. If <code>gnus-check-new-newsgroups</code> is
  <code>ask-server</code>, Gnus will ask the server for new groups
  since the last time. This is both faster and cheaper. This also
  means that you can get rid of the list of killed groups
  altogether, so you may set <code>gnus-save-killed-list</code> to
  <code>nil</code>, which will save time both at startup, at exit,
  and all over. Saves disk space, too. Why isn't this the default,
  then? Unfortunately, not all servers support this command.</p>

  <p>I bet I know what you're thinking now: How do I find out
  whether my server supports <code>ask-server</code>? No? Good,
  because I don't have a fail-safe answer. I would suggest just
  setting this variable to <code>ask-server</code> and see whether
  any new groups appear within the next few days. If any do, then
  it works. If none do, then it doesn't work. I could write a
  function to make Gnus guess whether the server supports
  <code>ask-server</code>, but it would just be a guess. So I
  won't. You could <code>telnet</code> to the server and say
  <code>HELP</code> and see whether it lists
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NEWGROUPS</span></samp>&rsquo;
  among the commands it understands. If it does, then it might
  work. (But there are servers that lists &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">NEWGROUPS</span></samp>&rsquo; without supporting the
  function properly.)</p>

  <p>This variable can also be a list of select methods. If so,
  Gnus will issue an <code>ask-server</code> command to each of the
  select methods, and subscribe them (or not) using the normal
  methods. This might be handy if you are monitoring a few servers
  for new groups. A side effect is that startup will take much
  longer, so you can meditate while waiting. Use the mantra
  &ldquo;dingnusdingnusdingnus&rdquo; to achieve permanent
  bliss.</p>
