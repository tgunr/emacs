  <h3 class="section">6.8 Email Based Diary</h3>

  <p><a name="index-diary-2284" id="index-diary-2284"></a><a name=
  "index-email-based-diary-2285" id=
  "index-email-based-diary-2285"></a><a name="index-calendar-2286"
  id="index-calendar-2286"></a> This section describes a special
  mail back end called <code>nndiary</code>, and its companion
  library <code>gnus-diary</code>. It is &ldquo;special&rdquo; in
  the sense that it is not meant to be one of the standard
  alternatives for reading mail with Gnus. See <a href=
  "Choosing-a-Mail-Back-End.html#Choosing-a-Mail-Back-End">Choosing
  a Mail Back End</a> for that. Instead, it is used to treat
  <em>some</em> of your mails in a special way, namely, as event
  reminders.</p>

  <p>Here is a typical scenario:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You've got a date with Andy Mc Dowell or Bruce Willis
    (select according to your sexual preference) in one month. You
    don't want to forget it.</li>

    <li>So you send a &ldquo;reminder&rdquo; message (actually, a
    diary one) to yourself.</li>

    <li>You forget all about it and keep on getting and reading new
    mail, as usual.</li>

    <li>From time to time, as you type `g' in the group buffer and
    as the date is getting closer, the message will pop up again to
    remind you of your appointment, just as if it were new and
    unread.</li>

    <li>Read your &ldquo;new&rdquo; messages, this one included,
    and start dreaming again of the night you're gonna have.</li>

    <li>Once the date is over (you actually fell asleep just after
    dinner), the message will be automatically deleted if it is
    marked as expirable.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Gnus Diary back end has the ability to handle regular
  appointments (that wouldn't ever be deleted) as well as punctual
  ones, operates as a real mail back end and is configurable in
  many ways. All of this is explained in the sections below.</p>
