  <h2 class="chapter">1 An overview of D-Bus</h2>

  <p><a name="index-overview-1" id="index-overview-1"></a> D-Bus is
  an inter-process communication mechanism for applications
  residing on the same host. The communication is based on
  <dfn>messages</dfn>. Data in the messages is carried in a
  structured way, it is not just a byte stream.</p>

  <p>The communication is connection oriented to two kinds of
  message buses: a so called <dfn>system bus</dfn>, and a
  <dfn>session bus</dfn>. On a given machine, there is always one
  single system bus for miscellaneous system-wide communication,
  like changing of hardware configuration. On the other hand, the
  session bus is always related to a single user's session.</p>

  <p>Every client application, which is connected to a bus,
  registers under a <dfn>unique name</dfn> at the bus. This name is
  used for identifying the client application. Such a unique name
  starts always with a colon, and looks like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:1.42</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Additionally, a client application can register itself to a so
  called <dfn>known name</dfn>, which is a series of identifiers
  separated by dots, as in &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">org.gnu.Emacs</span></samp>&rsquo;. If several
  applications register to the same known name, these registrations
  are queued, and only the first application which has registered
  for the known name is reachable via this name. If this
  application disconnects from the bus, the next queued unique name
  becomes the owner of this known name.</p>

  <p>An application can install one or several objects under its
  name. Such objects are identified by an <dfn>object path</dfn>,
  which looks similar to paths in a filesystem. An example of such
  an object path could be &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">/org/gnu/Emacs/</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Applications might send a request to an object, that means
  sending a message with some data as input parameters, and
  receiving a message from that object with the result of this
  message, the output parameters. Such a request is called
  <dfn>method</dfn> in D-Bus.</p>

  <p>The other form of communication are <dfn>signals</dfn>. The
  underlying message is emitted from an object and will be received
  by all other applications which have registered for such a
  signal.</p>

  <p>All methods and signals an object supports are called
  <dfn>interface</dfn> of the object. Interfaces are specified
  under a hierarchical name in D-Bus; an object can support several
  interfaces. Such an interface name could be
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">org.gnu.Emacs.TextEditor</span></samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">org.gnu.Emacs.FileManager</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
