  <h2 class="chapter">6 Configuration Basics</h2>
  <!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->

  <p><a name="index-Emacs-Initialization-File-264" id=
  "index-Emacs-Initialization-File-264"></a><a name=
  "index-Configuration-265" id="index-Configuration-265"></a>You
  configure CC Mode by setting Lisp variables and calling (and
  perhaps writing) Lisp functions<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1"
  name="fnd-1" id="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, which is usually done
  by adding code to an Emacs initialization file. This file might
  be <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> or
  <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> or
  <samp><span class="file">init.el</span></samp> or
  <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp> or perhaps some
  other file. See <a href="../emacs/Init-File.html#Init-File">Init
  File</a>. For the sake of conciseness, we just call this file
  &ldquo;your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>&rdquo;
  throughout the rest of the manual.</p>

  <p>Several of these variables (currently 16), are known
  collectively as <dfn>style variables</dfn>. CC Mode provides a
  special mechanism, known as <dfn>styles</dfn> to make it easier
  to set these variables as a group, to &ldquo;inherit&rdquo;
  settings from one style into another, and so on. Style variables
  remain ordinary Lisp variables, whose values can be read and
  changed independently of the style system. See <a href=
  "Style-Variables.html#Style-Variables">Style Variables</a>.</p>

  <p>There are several ways you can write the code, depending on
  the precise effect you want&mdash;they are described further down
  on this page. If you are new to CC Mode, we suggest you begin
  with the simplest method, &ldquo;Top-level commands or the
  customization interface&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>If you make conflicting settings in several of these ways, the
  way that takes precedence is the one that appears latest in this
  list:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <dl>
        <dt>Style</dt>

        <dt>File Style<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"
        id="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a></dt>

        <dt>Top-level command or &ldquo;customization
        interface&rdquo;</dt>

        <dt>Hook</dt>

        <dt>File Local Variable setting</dt>
      </dl>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is a summary of the different ways of writing your
  configuration settings:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Top-level commands or the &ldquo;customization
    interface&rdquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      Most simply, you can write <code>setq</code> and similar
      commands at the top level of your <samp><span class=
      "file">.emacs</span></samp> file. When you load a CC Mode
      buffer, it initializes its configuration from these global
      values (at least, for those settings you have given values
      to), so it makes sense to have these <code>setq</code>
      commands run <em>before</em> CC Mode is first
      initialized&mdash;in particular, before any call to
      <code>desktop-read</code> (see <a href=
      "../emacs/Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html#Saving-Emacs-Sessions">Saving
      Emacs Sessions</a>). For example, you might set
      c-basic-offset thus:
      <pre class="example">
          (setq c-basic-offset 4)
</pre>

      <p>You can use the more user friendly Customization interface
      instead, but this manual does not cover in detail how that
      works. To do this, start by typing <kbd>M-x customize-group
      &lt;RET&gt; c &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. See <a href=
      "../emacs/Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy
      Customization</a>.
      <!-- The following note really belongs in the Emacs manual. -->
       Emacs normally writes the customizations at the end of your
      <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. If you
      use <code>desktop-read</code>, you should edit your
      <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> to place the
      call to <code>desktop-read</code> <em>after</em> the
      customizations.</p>

      <p>The first initialization of CC Mode puts a snapshot of the
      configuration settings into the special style
      <code>user</code>. See <a href=
      "Built_002din-Styles.html#Built_002din-Styles">Built-in
      Styles</a>.</p>

      <p>For basic use of Emacs, either of these ways of
      configuring is adequate. However, the settings are then the
      same in all CC Mode buffers and it can be clumsy to
      communicate them between programmers. For more flexibility,
      you'll want to use one (or both) of CC Mode's more
      sophisticated facilities, hooks and styles.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Hooks</dt>

    <dd>
      An Emacs <dfn>hook</dfn> is a place to put Lisp functions
      that you want Emacs to execute later in specific
      circumstances. See <a href=
      "../elisp/Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>. CC Mode supplies a
      main hook and a language-specific hook for each language it
      supports - any functions you put onto these hooks get
      executed as the last part of a buffer's initialization.
      Typically you put most of your customization within the main
      hook, and use the language-specific hooks to vary the
      customization settings between language modes. For example,
      if you wanted different (non-standard) values of
      <code>c-basic-offset</code> in C Mode and Java Mode buffers,
      you could do it like this:
      <pre class="example">
          (defun my-c-mode-hook ()
            (setq c-basic-offset 3))
          (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)

          (defun my-java-mode-hook ()
            (setq c-basic-offset 6))
          (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'my-java-mode-hook)
</pre>

      <p>See <a href="CC-Hooks.html#CC-Hooks">CC Hooks</a> for more
      details on the use of CC Mode hooks.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Styles</dt>

    <dd>
      A CC Mode <dfn>style</dfn> is a coherent collection of
      customizations with a name. At any time, exactly one style is
      active in each CC Mode buffer, either the one you have
      selected or a default. CC Mode is delivered with several
      existing styles. Additionally, you can create your own
      styles, possibly based on these existing styles. If you
      worked in a programming team called the &ldquo;Free
      Group&rdquo;, which had its own coding standards, you might
      well have this in your <samp><span class=
      "file">.emacs</span></samp> file:
      <pre class="example">
          (setq c-default-style '((java-mode . "java")
                                  (awk-mode . "awk")
                                  (other . "free-group-style")))
</pre>

      <p>See <a href="Styles.html#Styles">Styles</a> for fuller
      details on using CC Mode styles and how to create
      them.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>File Local Variable setting</dt>

    <dd>A <dfn>file local variable setting</dfn> is a setting which
    applies to an individual source file. You put this in a
    <dfn>local variables list</dfn>, a special block at the end of
    the source file (see <a href=
    "../emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables">
    Specifying File Variables</a>).<br /></dd>

    <dt>File Styles</dt>

    <dd>A <dfn>file style</dfn> is a rarely used variant of the
    &ldquo;style&rdquo; mechanism described above, which applies to
    an individual source file. See <a href=
    "File-Styles.html#File-Styles">File Styles</a>. You use this by
    setting certain special variables in a local variables list
    (see <a href=
    "../emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables">
    Specifying File Variables</a>).<br /></dd>

    <dt>Hooks with Styles</dt>

    <dd>
      For ultimate flexibility, you can use hooks and styles
      together. For example, if your team were developing a product
      which required a Linux driver, you'd probably want to use the
      &ldquo;linux&rdquo; style for the driver, and your own team's
      style for the rest of the code. You could achieve this with
      code like this in your <samp><span class=
      "file">.emacs</span></samp>:
      <pre class="example">
          (defun my-c-mode-hook ()
            (c-set-style
             (if (and (buffer-file-name)
                      (string-match "/usr/src/linux" (buffer-file-name)))
                 "linux"
               "free-group-style")))
          (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)
</pre>

      <p>In a programming team, a hook is a also a good place for
      each member to put his own personal preferences. For example,
      you might be the only person in your team who likes
      Auto-newline minor mode. You could have it enabled by default
      by placing the following in your <samp><span class=
      "file">.emacs</span></samp>:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (defun my-turn-on-auto-newline ()
            (c-toggle-auto-newline 1))
          (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-turn-on-auto-newline)
</pre>
    </dd>
  </dl>
