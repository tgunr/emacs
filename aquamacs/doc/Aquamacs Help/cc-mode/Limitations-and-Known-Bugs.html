  <ul>
    <li>CC Mode doesn't support trigraphs. (These are character
    sequences such as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">??(</span></samp>&rsquo;, which represents
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo;. They
    date from a time when some character sets didn't have all the
    characters that C needs, and are now utterly obsolete.)</li>

    <li>There is no way to apply auto newline settings (see
      <a href="Auto_002dnewlines.html#Auto_002dnewlines">Auto-newlines</a>)
      on already typed lines. That's only a feature to ease
      interactive editing.

      <p>To generalize this issue a bit: CC Mode is not intended to
      be used as a reformatter for old code in some more or less
      batch-like way. With the exception of some functions like
      <code>c-indent-region</code>, it's only geared to be used
      interactively to edit new code. There's currently no
      intention to change this goal.</p>

      <p>If you want to reformat old code, you're probably better
      off using some other tool instead, e.g. <a href=
      "../indent/index.html#Top">GNU indent</a>, which has more
      powerful reformatting capabilities than CC Mode.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The support for C++ templates (in angle brackets) is not
    yet complete. When a non-nested template is used in a
    declaration, CC Mode indents it and font-locks it OK. Templates
    used in expressions, and nested templates do not fare so well.
    Sometimes a workaround is to refontify the expression after
    typing the closing &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.</li>

    <li>In a <dfn>k&amp;r region</dfn> (the part of an
    old-fashioned C function declaration which specifies the types
    of its parameters, coming between the parameter list and the
    opening brace), there should be at most 20 top-level
    parenthesis and bracket pairs. This limit has been imposed for
    performance reasons. If it is violated, the source file might
    be incorrectly indented or fontified.</li>

    <li>On loading CC Mode, sometimes this error message appears:
      <pre class="example">
          File mode specification error: (void-variable c-font-lock-keywords-3)
</pre>

      <p>This is due to a bug in the function
      <code>eval-after-load</code> in some versions of (X)Emacs. It
      can manifest itself when there is a symbolic link in the path
      of the directory which contains (X)Emacs. As a workaround,
      put the following into your <samp><span class=
      "file">.emacs</span></samp> file, fairly early on:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          (defun my-load-cc-fonts ()
            (require "cc-fonts"))
          (add-hook 'c-initialization-hook 'my-load-cc-fonts)
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
