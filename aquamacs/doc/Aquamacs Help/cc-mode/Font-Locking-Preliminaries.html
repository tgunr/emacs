  <h3 class="section">5.1 Font Locking Preliminaries</h3>
  <!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->

  <p>The font locking for most of the CC Mode languages were
  provided directly by the Font Lock package prior to version 5.30
  of CC Mode. In the transition to CC Mode the patterns have been
  reworked completely and are applied uniformly across all the
  languages except AWK mode, just like the indentation rules
  (although each language still has some peculiarities of its own,
  of course). Since the languages previously had completely
  separate font locking patterns, this means that it's a bit
  different in most languages now.</p>

  <p>The main goal for the font locking in CC Mode is accuracy, to
  provide a dependable aid in recognizing the various constructs.
  Some, like strings and comments, are easy to recognize while
  others, like declarations and types, can be very tricky. CC Mode
  can go to great lengths to recognize declarations and casts
  correctly, especially when the types aren't recognized by
  standard patterns. This is a fairly demanding analysis which can
  be slow on older hardware, and it can therefore be disabled by
  choosing a lower decoration level with the variable
  <code>font-lock-maximum-decoration</code> (see <a href=
  "../emacs/Font-Lock.html#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>).</p>

  <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dmaximum_002ddecoration-225"
  id="index-font_002dlock_002dmaximum_002ddecoration-225"></a> The
  decoration levels are used as follows:</p>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <!-- 1 -->

    <li>Minimal font locking: Fontify only comments, strings and
    preprocessor directives (in the languages that use cpp).
    <!-- 2 --></li>

    <li>Fast font locking: In addition to level 1, fontify
    keywords, simple types and declarations that are easy to
    recognize. The variables <code>*-font-lock-extra-types</code>
    (where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;
    is the name of the language) are used to recognize types (see
    below). Documentation comments like Javadoc are fontified
    according to <code>c-doc-comment-style</code> (see <a href=
    "Doc-Comments.html#Doc-Comments">Doc Comments</a>).

      <p>Use this if you think the font locking is too slow. It's
      the closest corresponding level to level 3 in the old font
      lock patterns. <!-- 3 --></p>
    </li>

    <li>Accurate font locking: Like level 2 but uses a different
    approach that can recognize types and declarations much more
    accurately. The <code>*-font-lock-extra-types</code> variables
    are still used, but user defined types are recognized correctly
    anyway in most cases. Therefore those variables should be
    fairly restrictive and not contain patterns that are uncertain.

      <p><a name="index-Lazy-Lock-mode-226" id=
      "index-Lazy-Lock-mode-226"></a><a name=
      "index-Just_002din_002dtime-Lock-mode-227" id=
      "index-Just_002din_002dtime-Lock-mode-227"></a> This level is
      designed for fairly modern hardware and a font lock support
      mode like Lazy Lock or Just-in-time Lock mode that only
      fontifies the parts that are actually shown. Fontifying the
      whole buffer at once can easily get bothersomely slow even on
      contemporary hardware. See <a href=
      "../emacs/Font-Lock.html#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>.</p>
    </li>

  are hard to recognize you can provide additional regexps to match
  those you use:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>For each language there's a variable
      <code>*-font-lock-extra-types</code>, where
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; stands
      for the language in question. It contains a list of regexps
      that matches identifiers that should be recognized as types,
      e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">\\sw+_t</span></samp>&rsquo; to recognize all
      identifiers ending with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">_t</span></samp>&rsquo; as is customary in C code.
      Each regexp should not match more than a single
      identifier.</p>

      <p>The default values contain regexps for many types in
      standard runtime libraries that are otherwise difficult to
      recognize, and patterns for standard type naming conventions
      like the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">_t</span></samp>&rsquo; suffix in C and C++. Java,
      Objective-C and Pike have as a convention to start class
      names with capitals, so there are patterns for that in those
      languages.</p>

      <p>Despite the names of these variables, they are not only
      used for fontification but in other places as well where CC
      Mode needs to recognize types.</p>
