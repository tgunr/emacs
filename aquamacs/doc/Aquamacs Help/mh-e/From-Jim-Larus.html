  <h3 class="appendixsec">D.2 From Jim Larus</h3>

  <p><a name="index-Jim-Larus-2251" id=
  "index-Jim-Larus-2251"></a><a name="index-Larus_002c-Jim-2252"
  id="index-Larus_002c-Jim-2252"></a> Brian Reid, while at CMU or
  shortly after going to Stanford wrote a mail reading program
  called MHE for Gosling Emacs. It had much the same structure as
  MH-E (i.e., invoked MH programs), though it was simpler and the
  commands were slightly different. Unfortunately, I no longer have
  a copy so the differences are lost in the mists of time.</p>

  <p>In '82-83, I was working at BBN and wrote a lot of mlisp code
  in Gosling Emacs to make it look more like Tennex Emacs. One of
  the packages that I picked up and improved was Reid's mail
  system. In '83, I went back to Berkeley. About that time,
  Stallman's first version of GNU Emacs came out and people started
  to move to it from Gosling Emacs (as I recall, the transition
  took a year or two). I decided to port Reid's MHE and used the
  mlisp to Emacs Lisp translator that came with GNU Emacs. It did a
  lousy job and the resulting code didn't work, so I bit the bullet
  and rewrote the code by hand (it was a lot smaller and simpler
  then, so it took only a day or two).</p>

  <p>Soon after that, MH-E became part of the standard Emacs
  distribution and suggestions kept dribbling in for improvements.
  MH-E soon reached sufficient functionality to keep me happy, but
  I kept on improving it because I was a graduate student with
  plenty of time on my hands and it was more fun than my
  dissertation. In retrospect, the one thing that I regret is not
  writing any documentation, which seriously limited the use and
  appeal of the package.</p>

  </a> In '89, I came to Wisconsin as a professor and decided not
  to work on MH-E. It was stable, except for minor bugs, and had
  enough functionality, so I let it be for a few years. Stephen
  Gildea of BBN began to pester me about the bugs, but I ignored
  them. In 1990, he went off to the X Consortium, said good bye,
  and said that he would now be using <samp><span class=
  "command">xmh</span></samp>. A few months later, he came back and
  said that he couldn't stand <samp><span class=
  "command">xmh</span></samp> and could I put a few more bug fixes
  into MH-E. At that point, I had no interest in fixing MH-E, so I
  gave the responsibility of maintenance to him and he has done a
  fine job since then.</p>
