  In 1987 I went to work for Bolt Beranek and Newman, as Jim had
  before me. In my previous job, I had been using RMAIL, but as my
  folders tend to run large, I was frustrated with the speed of
  RMAIL. However, I stuck with it because I wanted the GNU Emacs
  interface. I am very familiar and comfortable with the Emacs
  interface (with just a few modifications of my own) and dislike
  having to use applications with embedded editors; they never live
  up to Emacs.</p>

  <p>MH is the mail reader of choice at BBN, so I converted to it.
  Since I didn't want to give up using an Emacs interface, I
  started using MH-E. As is my wont, I started hacking on it almost
  immediately. I first used version 3.4m. One of the first features
  I added was to treat the folder buffer as a file-visiting buffer:
  you could lock it, save it, and be warned of unsaved changes when
  killing it. I also worked to bring its functionality a little
  closer to RMAIL. Jim Larus was very cooperative about merging in
  my changes, and my efforts first appeared in version 3.6,
  distributed with Emacs 18.52 in 1988. Next I decided MH-E was too
  slow and optimized it a lot. Version, 3.7, distributed with Emacs
  18.56 in 1990, was noticeably faster.</p>

  <p>When I moved to the X Consortium I became the first person
  there to not use xmh. (There is now one other engineer there
  using MH-E.) About this point I took over maintenance of MH-E
  from Jim and was finally able to add some features Jim hadn't
  accepted, such as the backward searching undo. My first release
  was 3.8 (Emacs 18.58) in 1992.</p>

  <p>Now, in 1994, we see a flurry of releases, with both 4.0 and
  5.0. Version 4.0 added many new features, including background
  folder collection and support for composing <span class=
  "sc">mime</span> messages. (Reading <span class="sc">mime</span>
  messages remains to be done, alas.) While writing this book, Bill
  Wohler gave MH-E its closest examination ever, uncovering bugs
  and inconsistencies that required a new major version to fix, and
  so version 5 was released.</p>
