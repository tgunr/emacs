  <p><a name="index-HTML-616" id="index-HTML-616"></a><a name=
  "index-Gnus-617" id="index-Gnus-617"></a> MH-E can display
  messages that have been sent in HTML<a rel="footnote" href=
  "#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The content of
  the message will appear in the MH-Show buffer as you would expect
  if the entire message is HTML, or there is an inline HTML body
  part. However, if there is an HTML body part that is an
  attachment, then you'll see a button like this:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     [1. text/html; foo.html]...
</pre>

  <p>To see how to read the contents of this body part, see

  Attachments</a>.</p>

  "index-mm_002dtext_002dhtml_002drenderer-618"></a> The browser
  that MH-E uses is determined by the option
  <code>mm-text-html-renderer</code>. The default setting is set
  automatically based upon the presence of a known browser on your
  system. If you wish to use a different browser, then set this
  option accordingly. See the documentation for the browser you use
  for additional information on how to use it. In particular, find
  and disable the option to render images as this can tip off
  spammers that the email address they have used is valid.</p>

  "index-mm_002dtext_002dhtml_002drenderer-619"></a> If you're
  confused about which <code>mm-text-html-renderer</code> to use,
  here's a brief description of each, sorted by popularity, that
  includes the results of a quick poll of MH-E users from
  2005-12-23. <a name=
  "index-browser_002c-_0040samp_007bw3m_007d-620" id=

  <dl>
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w3m</span></samp>&rsquo;
    7</dt>

    <dd>The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">w3m</span></samp>&rsquo; browser requires an external
    program. It's quick, produces pretty nice output, and best of
    all, it's the only browser that highlights links. These can be
    clicked with <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> to view the content of the link
    in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w3m</span></samp>&rsquo;.
    The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w3m</span></samp>&rsquo;
    browser handles tables well and actually respects the table's
    width parameter (which can cause text to wrap if the author
    didn't anticipate that the page would be viewed in Emacs).

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">w3m-standalone</span></samp>&rsquo; 3</dt>

    <dd>This browser, along with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">nil</span></samp>&rsquo; for the external browser, are
    the only choices that work without having to download a
    separate lisp package or external program. This browser is
    quick, but does not show links. It handles simple tables but
    some tables get rendered much wider than the Emacs frame. This
    browser was the only one not to handle the escape
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&amp;ndash;</span></samp>&rsquo; (it printed a
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;), but it
    did render &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&amp;reg;</span></samp>&rsquo;. <!--  -->
     <a name="index-browser_002c-_0040samp_007blinks_007d-625" id=

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">links</span></samp>&rsquo;
    1</dt>

    <dd>The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">links</span></samp>&rsquo; browser requires an external
    program. It's quick, and produces nicer output than
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lynx</span></samp>&rsquo; on
    single column mails in tables. However, it doesn't show links
    and it doesn't do as nice a job on multi-column tables as some
    lines wrap. At least it fits in 80 columns and thus seems
    better than &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">w3</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">w3m-standalone</span></samp>&rsquo;. Converts escapes
    such as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&amp;reg;</span></samp>&rsquo; to (R). <!--  -->
     <a name="index-browser_002c-_0040samp_007blynx_007d-627" id=

    "index-g_t_0040samp_007blynx_007d-628" id=

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lynx</span></samp>&rsquo;
    1</dt>

    <dd>The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">lynx</span></samp>&rsquo; browser requires an external
    program. It's quick and produces pretty decent output but it
    doesn't show links. It doesn't seem to do multi-column tables
    which makes output much cleaner. It centers the output and
    wraps long lines more than most. Handles
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;reg;</span></samp>&rsquo;.
    <!--  -->
    <br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nil</span></samp>&rsquo;
    1</dt>

    <dd>This choice obviously requires an external browser. Like
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">w3m-standalone</span></samp>&rsquo;, it works out of the
    box. With this setting, HTML messages have a button for the
    body part which you can view with <kbd>K v</kbd>
    (<code>mh-folder-toggle-mime-part</code>). <!--  -->
     <a name="index-browser_002c-_0040samp_007bw3_007d-629" id=

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w3</span></samp>&rsquo;
    0</dt>

    <dd>This choice does not require an external program as all of
    the rendering is done in lisp. You do need to get the package
    separately. This browser is <strong>slow</strong>, and doesn't
    appear to have been updated since 2001 and the author hasn't
    responded to my emails. It displays unknown tags instead of
    hiding them, so you get to see all the Microsoft crap in
    certain messages. Tends to make multi-column tables wider than
    even a full-screen Emacs can handle. Like
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w3m</span></samp>&rsquo;, you
    can follow links, but you have to find them first as they are
    not highlighted. Performs well on single-column tables and
    handles escapes such as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&amp;reg;</span></samp>&rsquo;. <!--  -->
     <a name="index-browser_002c-_0040samp_007bhtml2text_007d-631"

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">html2text</span></samp>&rsquo; 0</dt>

    <dd>The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">html2text</span></samp>&rsquo; browser requires an
    external program. I noticed that it can do some nasty things
    with simple HTML mails (like filling the entire message as if
    it were one paragraph, including signature). On another
    message, it displayed half of the HTML tags for some
    reason.</dd>
