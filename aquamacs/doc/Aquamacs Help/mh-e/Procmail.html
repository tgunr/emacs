  explains how to use <a href=

  lists into folders which can then be read easily with MH-E<a rel=
  "footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
  Some mailing lists have such high traffic that Gnus must be used
  and I discuss how to use Gnus side-by-side with MH-E.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002eprocmailrc_007d-2203" id=
  "index-g_t_0040file_007b_002eprocmailrc_007d-2203"></a><a name=

  First, I'll describe how to put mail from your mailing lists
  directly into an MH folder using <samp><span class=
  "command">procmail</span></samp>. First, add the following to
  <samp><span class="file">~/.procmailrc</span></samp>. While the
  logging variables aren't strictly necessary, they are extremely
  useful.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     [1]  # Update PATH so procmail can find myrcvstore, rcvstore and mhparam.
     [2]  PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/mh:/usr/bin/mh:$HOME/bin
     [3]
     [4]  # Point LOGFILE at the actual log file.
     [5]  LOGFILE=$HOME/.procmail.log
     [6]
     [7]  # This setting provides just the right amount of information.
     [8]  LOGABSTRACT=all
     [9]
     [10] # Uncomment the following line to see how your patterns match.
     [11] #VERBOSE=yes
     [12]
     [13] # Place mail sent to any MH-E mailing list in +mh-e.
     [14] :0 w: mh-e$LOCKEXT
     [15] * ^TO.*mh-e-.*.*sourceforge.net
     [16] | myrcvstore -create +mh-e
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007brcvstore_007d-2205" id=
  "index-g_t_0040command_007brcvstore_007d-2205"></a><a name=
  "index-MH-commands_002c-_0040command_007brcvstore_007d-2206" id=

  Line 14 creates a lock file in your mail directory based upon the
  name of the folder. This is done because <samp><span class=
  "command">rcvstore</span></samp> does not perform locking. While
  this lock file will prevent <samp><span class=
  "command">procmail</span></samp> from writing to a folder
  concurrently, there is a slight chance that you might lose a
  message if you're performing operations on a folder at the same
  time <samp><span class="command">rcvstore</span></samp> is
  placing a message there. You have been warned. Now that that
  disclaimer is out of the way, note that I've been using this
  set-up for over a decade and haven't lost anything to my
  knowledge<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2" id=
  "fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-g_t_0040samp_007bUnseen_002dSequence_003a_007d-MH-profile-component-2207"
  id=
  "index-g_t_0040samp_007bUnseen_002dSequence_003a_007d-MH-profile-component-2207">
  </a><a name=

  id=
  "index-MH-profile-component_002c-_0040samp_007bUnseen_002dSequence_003a_007d-2208"></a>
  Line 16 uses the following script, <code>myrcvstore</code>, to
  massage the message as described in the comment and file the
  message in the given folder<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name=
  "fnd-3" id="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     #! /bin/sh

     # Accepts a message on standard input and passes it through rcvstore
     # after first passing it through any filters. All arguments are passed
     # on to rcvstore.

     # Force the "From user date" to become part of header. One reason this
     # is done is because the presence of the From field confuses dist so
     # that dist adds a new header, rather than using the existing header.
     # Note that this should not be done for any message that goes into a
     # Gnus incoming file (Gnus will thrown an error) nor should it be
     # applied to any message that goes to the system mailbox because the
     # entire mailbox will be incorporated as a single message.
     formail -c -z -R 'From ' X-Envelope-From: |
     rcvstore $@
</pre>

  <p>If your version of <samp><span class=
  "command">rcvstore</span></samp> doesn't add messages to the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">unseen</span></samp>&rsquo;
  sequence by default, add the following line to your MH
  profile:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     Unseen-Sequence: unseen
</pre>

  <p>Now view your new messages with the speedbar (see <a href=
  "Speedbar.html#Speedbar">Speedbar</a>) or with <kbd>F n</kbd>
  (<code>mh-index-new-messages</code>). See <a href=
  "Folders.html#Folders">Folders</a>.</p>

  <p>If you're on a mailing list that is so voluminous that it is
  impossible to read every message, it usually better to read the
  mailing list like a newsgroup in a news reader. Emacs has a
  built-in newsreader called Gnus. The remainder of this appendix
  talks about how to use Gnus with an MH message store. The version
  of Gnus that was used to prepare this manual was 5.10. Versions
  5.8 through 5.10 should work but versions prior to 5.8 use
  different options.</p>

  <p>This table contains a list of Gnus options that you will have
  to modify. Note that for them to become accessible, you'll have
  to load <samp><span class="file">nnml.el</span></samp> first.
  This can be done with <kbd>M-x load-library &lt;RET&gt; nnml
  &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code><a name=
    "index-gnus_002dsecondary_002dselect_002dmethods-2209" id=
    "index-gnus_002dsecondary_002dselect_002dmethods-2209"></a></dt>

    <dd>Select the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">nnml</span></samp>&rsquo; value. This select method uses
    directories for folders and individual files for messages, just
    like MH. You do not have to set an address. <!--  -->
    <br /></dd>

    <dt><code>mail-sources</code><a name=
    "index-mail_002dsources-2210" id=
    "index-mail_002dsources-2210"></a></dt>

    <dd>Select the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Several files in
    a directory</span></samp>&rsquo; value, check the
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Path</span></samp>&rsquo; box
    and enter <samp><span class="file">~/Mail</span></samp> to tell
    Gnus where to find your mail. <!--  -->
     <a name="index-mail_002duser_002dagent-2211" id=
    "index-mail_002duser_002dagent-2211"></a><br /></dd>

    <dt><code>message-mail-user-agent</code><a name=
    "index-message_002dmail_002duser_002dagent-2212" id=
    "index-message_002dmail_002duser_002dagent-2212"></a></dt>

    <dd>In order to send mail within Gnus using MH-E, set this
    option to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">mail-user-agent</span></samp>&rsquo; and set the
    <code>mail-user-agent</code> option to
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Emacs interface to
    MH</span></samp>&rsquo;. <!--  -->
    <br /></dd>

    <dt><code>nnmail-keep-last-article</code><a name=
    "index-nnmail_002dkeep_002dlast_002darticle-2213" id=
    "index-nnmail_002dkeep_002dlast_002darticle-2213"></a></dt>

    <dd>Since Gnus keeps track of which messages you have read, it
    would be bad if Gnus expired the last message, for example,
    message 100, and <samp><span class=
    "command">rcvstore</span></samp> gave the next new message
    number 1. Gnus would then ignore it since it thinks that you've
    read messages 1-100. Turning on this option ensures that the
    last message is never removed thereby eliminating this
    problem.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Next add the following to <samp><span class=
  "file">~/.procmailrc</span></samp>. If you don't subscribe to the
  GnuCash mailing list, substitute one to which you are
  subscribed.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/mh
     MAILDIR=$HOME/`mhparam Path`
     # Place mail sent to the GnuCash mailing list in gnucash.spool, where
     # Gnus will pick it up.
     :0:
     * ^TO.*gnucash.*.*gnucash.org
     gnucash.spool
</pre>

  <p>Wait for some messages to appear in <samp><span class=
  "file">gnucash.spool</span></samp> and run Gnus with <kbd>M-x
  gnus &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. To view the folder created in the example
  above, you would tell Gnus about it the first time only with
  <kbd>G m gnucash &lt;RET&gt; nnml &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. In MH-E,
  this folder is known as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+gnucash</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
