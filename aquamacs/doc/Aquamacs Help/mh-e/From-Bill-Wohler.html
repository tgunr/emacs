  <h3 class="appendixsec">D.4 From Bill Wohler</h3>

  <p><a name="index-Wohler_002c-Bill-2256" id=
  "index-Wohler_002c-Bill-2256"></a><a name=
  "index-Bill-Wohler-2257" id="index-Bill-Wohler-2257"></a> The
  preface originally included the following text which I use to
  begin my story:</p>

  <blockquote>
    But it's important to note a brief history of MH-E.

    <p>Version&nbsp;3<!-- /@w --> was prevalent through the
    Emacs&nbsp;18<!-- /@w --> and early Emacs&nbsp;19<!-- /@w -->
     years. Then Version&nbsp;4<!-- /@w --> came out
    (Emacs&nbsp;19.23<!-- /@w -->), which introduced several new
    and changed commands. Next, Version&nbsp;5.0<!-- /@w --> was
    released, which fixed some bugs and incompatibilities, and was
    incorporated into Emacs&nbsp;19.29<!-- /@w -->.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After a long break, Stephen handed the reins over to me in
  2000. I moved the project to a new site called SourceForge and
  organized a great team of developers. Our first release in late
  2001 was version 6. It appeared around the time of Emacs 21.2 and
  had menus and tool bar buttons.</p>

  <p>Then, indexed searches, improved MIME handling, a speedbar,
  multiple identities, alias completion, an index view of unseen
  messages, spam software support, Face and X-Image-URL header
  field support, Fcc completion, arbitrary range handling, and
  draft form editing were introduced in the version 7 series around
  the time of Emacs 21.4 (2004). Still, Emacs itself contained
  version 5 of MH-E released back in 1994.</p>

  <p>Version 8 development was mostly driven by the rewrite of the
  manual. It also brought GNU mailutils MH support, S/MIME support,
  picon support, and an improved interface for hiding header
  fields. The CVS repository was migrated from SourceForge to
  Savannah (only for those files that were already part of Emacs)
  and the software was completely reorganized to push back two
  decades of entropy. Version 8 appeared in Emacs 22.1 in 2006.</p>

  <p>Development was then quiet for a couple of years. Emacs 23.1,
  released in June 2009, contains version 8.2. This version
  includes a few new features and several bug fixes.</p>
