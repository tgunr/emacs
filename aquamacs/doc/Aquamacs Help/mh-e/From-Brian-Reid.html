  <h3 class="appendixsec">D.1 From Brian Reid</h3>

  <p><a name="index-Brian-Reid-2249" id=
  "index-Brian-Reid-2249"></a><a name="index-Reid_002c-Brian-2250"
  id="index-Reid_002c-Brian-2250"></a> One day in 1983 I got the
  flu and had to stay home from work for three days with nothing to
  do. I used that time to write MHE. The fundamental idea behind
  MHE was that it was a &ldquo;puppeteer&rdquo; driving the MH
  programs underneath it. MH had a model that the editor was
  supposed to run as a sub-process of the mailer, which seemed to
  me at the time to be the tail wagging the dog. So I turned it
  around and made the editor drive the MH programs. I made sure
  that the UCI people (who were maintaining MH at the time) took in
  my changes and made them stick.</p>

  <p>Today, I still use my own version of MHE because I don't at
  all like the way that GNU MH-E works and I've never gotten to be
  good enough at hacking Emacs Lisp to make GNU MH-E do what I
  want. The Gosling-emacs version of MHE and the GNU Emacs version
  of MH-E have almost nothing in common except similar names. They
  work differently, have different conceptual models, and have
  different key bindings<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"

    <h4>Footnotes</h4>

    <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1" id=
    "fn-1">1</a>]</small> After reading this article, I questioned
    Brian about his version of MHE, and received some great ideas
    for improving MH-E such as a dired-like method of selecting
    folders; and removing the prompting when sending mail, filling
    in the blanks in the draft buffer instead. I passed them on to
    Stephen Gildea, the current maintainer, and he was excited
    about the ideas as well. Perhaps one day, MH-E will again
    resemble MHE (draft form editing was introduced in version
    7.4).</p>
