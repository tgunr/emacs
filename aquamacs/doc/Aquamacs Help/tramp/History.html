  <h2 class="chapter">3 History of <span class=
  "sc">tramp</span></h2>

  <p><a name="index-history-6" id="index-history-6"></a><a name=
  "index-development-history-7" id=
  "index-development-history-7"></a> Development was started end of
  November 1998. The package was called <samp><span class=
  "file">rssh.el</span></samp>, back then. It only provided one
  method to access a file, using <samp><span class=
  "command">ssh</span></samp> to log in to a remote host and using
  <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> to transfer the
  file contents. After a while, the name was changed to
  <samp><span class="file">rcp.el</span></samp>, and now it's
  <span class="sc">tramp</span>. Along the way, many more methods
  for getting a remote shell and for transferring the file contents
  were added. Support for VC was added.</p>

  <p>After that, there were added the multi-hop methods in April
  2000 and the unification of <span class="sc">tramp</span> and
  Ange-FTP filenames in July 2002. In July 2004, multi-hop methods
  have been replaced by proxy hosts. Running commands on remote
  hosts was introduced in December 2005. Support of gateways exists
  since April 2007. GVFS integration started in February 2009.
  Storing files into IMAP mailboxes has been added in September
  2009.</p>

  <p>In December 2001, <span class="sc">tramp</span> has been added
  to the XEmacs package repository. Being part of the GNU Emacs
  repository happened in June 2002, the first release including
  <span class="sc">tramp</span> was GNU Emacs 22.1.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> is also a GNU/Linux Debian
  package since February 2001.
