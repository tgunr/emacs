  <h2 class="chapter">10 Debatable Issues and What Was Decided</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The uuencode method does not always work.

      <p>Due to the design of <span class="sc">tramp</span>, the
      encoding and decoding programs need to read from stdin and
      write to stdout. On some systems, <samp><span class=
      "command">uudecode -o -</span></samp> will read stdin and
      write the decoded file to stdout, on other systems
      <samp><span class="command">uudecode -p</span></samp> does
      the same thing. But some systems have uudecode
      implementations which cannot do this at all&mdash;it is not
      possible to call these uudecode implementations with suitable
      parameters so that they write to stdout.</p>

      <p>Of course, this could be circumvented: the <code>begin foo
      644</code> line could be rewritten to put in some temporary
      file name, then <samp><span class=
      "command">uudecode</span></samp> could be called, then the
      temp file could be printed and deleted.</p>

      <p>But I have decided that this is too fragile to reliably
      work, so on some systems you'll have to do without the
      uuencode methods.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The <span class="sc">tramp</span> filename syntax differs
    between GNU Emacs and XEmacs.

      <p>The GNU Emacs maintainers wish to use a unified filename
      syntax for Ange-FTP and <span class="sc">tramp</span> so that
      users don't have to learn a new syntax. It is sufficient to
      learn some extensions to the old syntax.</p>

      <p>For the XEmacs maintainers, the problems caused from using
      a unified filename syntax are greater than the gains. The
      XEmacs package system uses EFS for downloading new packages.
      So, obviously, EFS has to be installed from the start. If the
      filenames were unified, <span class="sc">tramp</span> would
      have to be installed from the start, too.</p>
