  <h2 class="chapter">1 An overview of <span class=
  "sc">tramp</span></h2>

  <p><a name="index-overview-1" id="index-overview-1"></a> After
  the installation of <span class="sc">tramp</span> into your GNU
  Emacs, you will be able to access files on remote machines as
  though they were local. Access to the remote file system for
  editing files, version control, and <code>dired</code> are
  transparently enabled.</p>

  <p>Your access to the remote machine can be with the
  <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">rlogin</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">telnet</span></samp> programs or with any similar
  connection method. This connection must pass
  <acronym>ASCII</acronym> successfully to be usable but need not
  be 8-bit clean.</p>

  <p>The package provides support for <samp><span class=
  "command">ssh</span></samp> connections out of the box, one of
  the more common uses of the package. This allows relatively
  secure access to machines, especially if <samp><span class=
  "command">ftp</span></samp> access is disabled.</p>

  <p>Under Windows, <span class="sc">tramp</span> is integrated
  with the PuTTY package, using the <samp><span class=
  "command">plink</span></samp> program.</p>

  <p>The majority of activity carried out by <span class=
  "sc">tramp</span> requires only that the remote login is possible
  and is carried out at the terminal. In order to access remote
  files <span class="sc">tramp</span> needs to transfer their
  content to the local machine temporarily.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> can transfer files between the
  machines in a variety of ways. The details are easy to select,
  depending on your needs and the machines in question.</p>

  <p>The fastest transfer methods for large files rely on a remote
  file transfer package such as <samp><span class=
  "command">rcp</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">scp</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">rsync</span></samp> or (under Windows)
  <samp><span class="command">pscp</span></samp>.</p>

  <p>If the remote copy methods are not suitable for you,
  <span class="sc">tramp</span> also supports the use of encoded
  transfers directly through the shell. This requires that the
  <samp><span class="command">mimencode</span></samp> or
  <samp><span class="command">uuencode</span></samp> tools are
  available on the remote machine. These methods are generally
  faster for small files.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> is still under active
  development and any problems you encounter, trivial or major,
  should be reported to the <span class="sc">tramp</span>
  developers. See <a href="Bug-Reports.html#Bug-Reports">Bug
  Reports</a>.</p>

  <h5 class="subsubheading">Behind the scenes</h5>

  <p><a name="index-behind-the-scenes-2" id=
  "index-behind-the-scenes-2"></a><a name=
  "index-details-of-operation-3" id=
  "index-details-of-operation-3"></a><a name="index-how-it-works-4"
  id="index-how-it-works-4"></a> This section tries to explain what
  goes on behind the scenes when you access a remote file through
  <span class="sc">tramp</span>.</p>

  <p>Suppose you type <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> and enter part of an
  <span class="sc">tramp</span> file name, then hit
  <kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> for completion. Suppose further that this
  is the first time that <span class="sc">tramp</span> is invoked
  for the host in question. Here's what happens:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="sc">tramp</span> discovers that it needs a
    connection to the host. So it invokes &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">telnet</span> <var>host</var></samp>&rsquo; or
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rsh</span> <var>host</var>
    <span class="samp">-l</span> <var>user</var></samp>&rsquo; or a
    similar tool to connect to the remote host. Communication with
    this process happens through an GNU Emacs buffer, that is, the
    output from the remote end goes into a buffer.</li>

    <li>The remote host may prompt for a login name (for
    <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp>). The login
    name is given in the file name, so <span class=
    "sc">tramp</span> sends the login name and a newline.</li>

    <li>The remote host may prompt for a password or pass phrase
    (for <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp> or for
    <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp> after sending
    the login name). <span class="sc">tramp</span> displays the
    prompt in the minibuffer, asking you for the password or pass
    phrase.

      <p>You enter the password or pass phrase. <span class=
      "sc">tramp</span> sends it to the remote host, followed by a
      newline.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span class="sc">tramp</span> now waits for the shell prompt
      or for a message that the login failed.

      <p>If <span class="sc">tramp</span> sees neither of them
      after a certain period of time (a minute, say), then it
      issues an error message saying that it couldn't find the
      remote shell prompt and shows you what the remote host has
      sent.</p>

      <p>If <span class="sc">tramp</span> sees a
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">login
      failed</span></samp>&rsquo; message, it tells you so, aborts
      the login attempt and allows you to try again.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Suppose that the login was successful and <span class="sc">
      tramp</span> sees the shell prompt from the remote host. Now
      <span class="sc">tramp</span> invokes <samp><span class=
      "command">/bin/sh</span></samp> because Bourne shells and C
      shells have different command syntaxes.<a rel="footnote"
      href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

      <p>After the Bourne shell has come up, <span class=
      "sc">tramp</span> sends a few commands to ensure a good
      working environment. It turns off echoing, it sets the shell
      prompt, and a few other things.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Now the remote shell is up and it good working order.
    Remember, what was supposed to happen is that <span class="sc">
      tramp</span> tries to find out what files exist on the remote
      host so that it can do filename completion.

      <p>So, <span class="sc">tramp</span> basically issues
      <samp><span class="command">cd</span></samp> and
      <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> commands and
      also sometimes <samp><span class="command">echo</span></samp>
      with globbing. Another command that is often used is
      <samp><span class="command">test</span></samp> to find out
      whether a file is writable or a directory or the like. The
      output of each command is parsed for the necessary
      operation.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Suppose you are finished with filename completion, have
    entered <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, a full file name and hit
    <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. Now comes the time to transfer the file
    contents from the remote host to the local host so that you can
    edit them.

      <p>See above for an explanation of how <span class=
      "sc">tramp</span> transfers the file contents.</p>

      <p>For inline transfers, <span class="sc">tramp</span> issues
      a command like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mimencode -b
      /path/to/remote/file</span></samp>&rsquo;, waits until the
      output has accumulated in the buffer that's used for
      communication, then decodes that output to produce the file
      contents.</p>

      <p>For external transfers, <span class="sc">tramp</span>
      issues a command like the following:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          rcp user@host:/path/to/remote/file /tmp/tramp.4711
</pre>

      <p>It then reads the local temporary file <samp><span class=
      "file">/tmp/tramp.4711</span></samp> into a buffer and
      deletes the temporary file.</p>
    </li>

    <li>You now edit the buffer contents, blithely unaware of what
    has happened behind the scenes. (Unless you have read this
    section, that is.) When you are finished, you type <kbd>C-x
    C-s</kbd> to save the buffer.</li>

    <li>Again, <span class="sc">tramp</span> transfers the file
    contents to the remote host either inline or external. This is
    the reverse of what happens when reading the file.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I hope this has provided you with a basic overview of what
  happens behind the scenes when you open a file with <span class=
  "sc">tramp</span>. <!-- For the end user --></p>
