  <h3 class="section">4.2 Inline methods</h3>

  <p><a name="index-inline-methods-15" id=
  "index-inline-methods-15"></a><a name=
  "index-methods_002c-inline-16" id=
  "index-methods_002c-inline-16"></a> The inline methods in
  <span class="sc">tramp</span> are quite powerful and can work in
  situations where you cannot use an external transfer program to
  connect. Inline methods are the only methods that work when
  connecting to the remote machine via telnet. (There are also
  strange inline methods which allow you to transfer files between
  <em>user identities</em> rather than hosts, see below.)</p>

  <p>These methods depend on the existence of a suitable encoding
  and decoding command on remote machine. Locally, <span class=
  "sc">tramp</span> may be able to use features of GNU Emacs to
  decode and encode the files or it may require access to external
  commands to perform that task.</p>

  <p><a name="index-uuencode-17" id=
  "index-uuencode-17"></a><a name="index-mimencode-18" id=
  "index-mimencode-18"></a><a name="index-base_002d64-encoding-19"
  id="index-base_002d64-encoding-19"></a><span class=
  "sc">tramp</span> checks the availability and usability of
  commands like <samp><span class="command">mimencode</span></samp>
  (part of the <samp><span class="command">metamail</span></samp>
  package) or <samp><span class="command">uuencode</span></samp> on
  the remote host. The first reliable command will be used. The
  search path can be customized, see <a href=
  "Remote-Programs.html#Remote-Programs">Remote Programs</a>.</p>

  <p>If both commands aren't available on the remote host,
  <span class="sc">tramp</span> transfers a small piece of Perl
  code to the remote host, and tries to apply it for encoding and
  decoding.</p>

  <p>The variable <var>tramp-inline-compress-start-size</var>
  controls, whether a file shall be compressed before encoding.
  This could increase transfer speed for large text files.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><samp><span class="option">rsh</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-method-rsh-20" id=
      "index-method-rsh-20"></a><a name="index-rsh-method-21" id=
      "index-rsh-method-21"></a> Connect to the remote host with
      <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>. Due to the
      unsecure connection it is recommended for very local host
      topology only.

      <p>On operating systems which provide the command
      <samp><span class="command">remsh</span></samp> instead of
      <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>, you can use
      the method <samp><span class="option">remsh</span></samp>.
      This is true for HP-UX or Cray UNICOS, for example.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-method-ssh-22" id=
      "index-method-ssh-22"></a><a name="index-ssh-method-23" id=
      "index-ssh-method-23"></a> Connect to the remote host with
      <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>. This is
      identical to the previous option except that the
      <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> package is
      used, making the connection more secure.

      <p>There are also two variants, <samp><span class=
      "option">ssh1</span></samp> and <samp><span class=
      "option">ssh2</span></samp>, that call
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh -1</span></samp>&rsquo;
      and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh
      -2</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively. This way, you can
      explicitly select whether you want to use the SSH protocol
      version 1 or 2 to connect to the remote host. (You can also
      specify in <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.ssh/config</span></samp>, the SSH configuration
      file, which protocol should be used, and use the regular
      <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp> method.)</p>

      <p>All the methods based on <samp><span class=
      "command">ssh</span></samp> have an additional feature: you
      can specify a host name which looks like <samp><span class=
      "file">host#42</span></samp> (the real host name, then a hash
      sign, then a port number). This means to connect to the given
      host but to also pass <code>-p 42</code> as arguments to the
      <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>
      command.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><samp><span class="option">telnet</span></samp></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-method-telnet-24" id=
    "index-method-telnet-24"></a><a name="index-telnet-method-25"
    id="index-telnet-method-25"></a> Connect to the remote host
    with <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp>. This is
    as unsecure as the <samp><span class="option">rsh</span></samp>
    method.<br /></dd>

    <dt><samp><span class="option">su</span></samp></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-method-su-26" id=
    "index-method-su-26"></a><a name="index-su-method-27" id=
    "index-su-method-27"></a> This method does not connect to a
    remote host at all, rather it uses the <samp><span class=
    "command">su</span></samp> program to allow you to edit files
    as another user. That means, the specified host name in the
    file name must be either &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">localhost</span></samp>&rsquo; or the host name as
    returned by the function <samp><span class=
    "command">(system-name)</span></samp>. For an exception of this
    rule see <a href=
    "Multi_002dhops.html#Multi_002dhops">Multi-hops</a>.<br /></dd>

    <dt><samp><span class="option">sudo</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-method-sudo-28" id=
      "index-method-sudo-28"></a><a name="index-sudo-method-29" id=
      "index-sudo-method-29"></a> This is similar to the
      <samp><span class="option">su</span></samp> method, but it
      uses <samp><span class="command">sudo</span></samp> rather
      than <samp><span class="command">su</span></samp> to become a
      different user.

      <p>Note that <samp><span class="command">sudo</span></samp>
      must be configured to allow you to start a shell as the user.
      It would be nice if it was sufficient if <samp><span class=
      "command">ls</span></samp> and <samp><span class=
      "command">mimencode</span></samp> were allowed, but that is
      not easy to implement, so I haven't got around to it,
      yet.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><samp><span class="option">sshx</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-method-sshx-30" id=
      "index-method-sshx-30"></a><a name="index-sshx-method-31" id=
      "index-sshx-method-31"></a> As you would expect, this is
      similar to <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>, only
      a little different. Whereas <samp><span class=
      "option">ssh</span></samp> opens a normal interactive shell
      on the remote host, this option uses
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh -t -t</span>
      <var>host</var> <span class="samp">-l</span> <var>user</var>
      <span class="samp">/bin/sh</span></samp>&rsquo; to open a
      connection. This is useful for users where the normal login
      shell is set up to ask them a number of questions when
      logging in. This procedure avoids these questions, and just
      gives <span class="sc">tramp</span> a more-or-less `standard'
      login shell to work with.

      <p>Note that this procedure does not eliminate questions
      asked by <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>
      itself. For example, <samp><span class=
      "command">ssh</span></samp> might ask &ldquo;Are you sure you
      want to continue connecting?&rdquo; if the host key of the
      remote host is not known. <span class="sc">tramp</span> does
      not know how to deal with such a question (yet), therefore
      you will need to make sure that you can log in without such
      questions.</p>

      <p>This is also useful for Windows users where
      <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>, when invoked
      from an GNU Emacs buffer, tells them that it is not
      allocating a pseudo tty. When this happens, the login shell
      is wont to not print any shell prompt, which confuses
      <span class="sc">tramp</span> mightily.</p>

      <p>This supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><samp><span class="option">krlogin</span></samp></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-method-krlogin-32" id=
    "index-method-krlogin-32"></a><a name="index-krlogin-method-33"
    id="index-krlogin-method-33"></a><a name=
    "index-Kerberos-_0028with-krlogin-method_0029-34" id=
    "index-Kerberos-_0028with-krlogin-method_0029-34"></a> This
    method is also similar to <samp><span class=
    "option">ssh</span></samp>. It only uses the <samp><span class=
    "command">krlogin -x</span></samp> command to log in to the
    remote host.<br /></dd>

    <dt><samp><span class="option">ksu</span></samp></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-method-ksu-35" id=
    "index-method-ksu-35"></a><a name="index-ksu-method-36" id=
    "index-ksu-method-36"></a><a name=
    "index-Kerberos-_0028with-ksu-method_0029-37" id=
    "index-Kerberos-_0028with-ksu-method_0029-37"></a> This is
    another method from the Kerberos suite. It behaves like
    <samp><span class="option">su</span></samp>.<br /></dd>

    <dt><samp><span class="option">plink</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-method-plink-38" id=
      "index-method-plink-38"></a><a name="index-plink-method-39"
      id="index-plink-method-39"></a> This method is mostly
      interesting for Windows users using the PuTTY implementation
      of SSH. It uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plink
      -ssh</span></samp>&rsquo; to log in to the remote host.

      <p>This supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">-P</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the methods <samp><span class=
      "option">plink1</span></samp> and <samp><span class=
      "option">plink2</span></samp> are provided, which call
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plink -1
      -ssh</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">plink -2 -ssh</span></samp>&rsquo; in order to use SSH
      protocol version 1 or 2 explicitly.</p>

      <p>CCC: Do we have to connect to the remote host once from
      the command line to accept the SSH key? Maybe this can be
      made automatic?</p>

      <p>CCC: Say something about the first shell command failing.
      This might be due to a wrong setting of
      <code>tramp-rsh-end-of-line</code>.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><samp><span class="option">plinkx</span></samp></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-method-plinkx-40" id=
    "index-method-plinkx-40"></a><a name="index-plinkx-method-41"
    id="index-plinkx-method-41"></a> Another method using PuTTY on
    Windows. Instead of host names, it expects PuTTY session names,
    calling &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plink -load</span>
    <var>session</var><span class="samp">-t"</span></samp>&rsquo;.
    User names are relevant only in case the corresponding session
    hasn't defined a user name. Different port numbers must be
    defined in the session.</dd>
