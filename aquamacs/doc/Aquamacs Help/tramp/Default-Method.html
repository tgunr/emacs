  <h3 class="section">4.6 Selecting a default method</h3>

  <p><a name="index-default-method-114" id=
  "index-default-method-114"></a> <a name=
  "index-tramp_002ddefault_002dmethod-115" id=
  "index-tramp_002ddefault_002dmethod-115"></a>When you select an
  appropriate transfer method for your typical usage you should set
  the variable <code>tramp-default-method</code> to reflect that
  choice. This variable controls which method will be used when a
  method is not specified in the <span class="sc">tramp</span> file
  name. For example:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq tramp-default-method "ssh")
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-tramp_002ddefault_002dmethod_002dalist-116" id=
  "index-tramp_002ddefault_002dmethod_002dalist-116"></a>You can
  also specify different methods for certain user/host
  combinations, via the variable
  <code>tramp-default-method-alist</code>. For example, the
  following two lines specify to use the <samp><span class=
  "option">ssh</span></samp> method for all user names matching
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">john</span></samp>&rsquo; and the
  <samp><span class="option">rsync</span></samp> method for all
  host names matching &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">lily</span></samp>&rsquo;. The third line specifies to use
  the <samp><span class="option">su</span></samp> method for the
  user &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">root</span></samp>&rsquo; on
  the machine &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">localhost</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (add-to-list 'tramp-default-method-alist '("" "john" "ssh"))
     (add-to-list 'tramp-default-method-alist '("lily" "" "rsync"))
     (add-to-list 'tramp-default-method-alist
                  '("\\`localhost\\'" "\\`root\\'" "su"))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">See the documentation for the variable
  <code>tramp-default-method-alist</code> for more details.</p>

  <p>External methods are normally preferable to inline methods,
  giving better performance.</p>

  <p>See <a href="Inline-methods.html#Inline-methods">Inline
  methods</a>. See <a href=
  "External-methods.html#External-methods">External
  methods</a>.</p>

  <p>Another consideration with the selection of transfer methods
  is the environment you will use them in and, especially when used
  over the Internet, the security implications of your preferred
  method.</p>

  <p>The <samp><span class="option">rsh</span></samp> and
  <samp><span class="option">telnet</span></samp> methods send your
  password as plain text as you log in to the remote machine, as
  well as transferring the files in such a way that the content can
  easily be read from other machines.</p>

  <p>If you need to connect to remote systems that are accessible
  from the Internet, you should give serious thought to using
  <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp> based methods to
  connect. These provide a much higher level of security, making it
  a non-trivial exercise for someone to obtain your password or
  read the content of the files you are editing.</p>

  <h4 class="subsection">4.6.1 Which method is the right one for
  me?</h4>

  <p><a name="index-choosing-the-right-method-117" id=
  "index-choosing-the-right-method-117"></a> Given all of the
  above, you are probably thinking that this is all fine and good,
  but it's not helping you to choose a method! Right you are. As a
  developer, we don't want to boss our users around but give them
  maximum freedom instead. However, the reality is that some users
  would like to have some guidance, so here I'll try to give you
  this guidance without bossing you around. You tell me whether it
  works <small class="dots">...</small></p>

  <p>My suggestion is to use an inline method. For large files,
  external methods might be more efficient, but I guess that most
  people will want to edit mostly small files. And if you access
  large text files, compression (driven by
  <var>tramp-inline-compress-start-size</var>) shall still result
  in good performance.</p>

  <p>I guess that these days, most people can access a remote
  machine by using <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>.
  So I suggest that you use the <samp><span class=
  "option">ssh</span></samp> method. So, type <kbd>C-x C-f /ssh
  <!-- /@w -->:root<!-- /@w -->@otherhost:/etc/motd
  &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to edit the <samp><span class=
  "file">/etc/motd</span></samp> file on the other host.</p>

  <p>If you can't use <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>
  to log in to the remote host, then select a method that uses a
  program that works. For instance, Windows users might like the
  <samp><span class="option">plink</span></samp> method which uses
  the PuTTY implementation of <samp><span class=
  "command">ssh</span></samp>. Or you use Kerberos and thus like
  <samp><span class="option">krlogin</span></samp>.</p>

  <p>For the special case of editing files on the local host as
  another user, see the <samp><span class="option">su</span></samp>
  or <samp><span class="option">sudo</span></samp> methods. They
  offer shortened syntax for the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">root</span></samp>&rsquo; account, like <samp><span class=
  "file">/su<!-- /@w -->::/etc/motd</span></samp>.</p>

  <p>People who edit large files may want to consider
  <samp><span class="option">scpc</span></samp> instead of
  <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>, or
  <samp><span class="option">pscp</span></samp> instead of
  <samp><span class="option">plink</span></samp>. These external
  methods are faster than inline methods for large files. Note,
  however, that external methods suffer from some limitations.
  Please try first whether you really get a noticeable speed
  advantage from using an external method! Maybe even for large
  files, inline methods are fast enough.</p>
