  The external methods operate through multiple channels, using the
  remote shell connection for many actions while delegating file
  transfers to an external transfer utility.</p>

  <p>This saves the overhead of encoding and decoding that
  multiplexing the transfer through the one connection has with the
  inline methods.</p>

  <p>Since external methods need their own overhead opening a new
  channel, all files which are smaller than
  <var>tramp-copy-size-limit</var> are still transferred with the
  corresponding inline method. It should provide a fair trade-off
  between both approaches.</p>

      <samp><span class="command">rcp</span></samp> commands to
      connect to the remote machine and transfer files. This is
      probably the fastest connection method available.

      <p>The alternative method <samp><span class=

      "command">remsh</span></samp> and <samp><span class=
      "command">rcp</span></samp> commands. It should be applied on
      machines where <samp><span class=

      "index-ssh-_0028with-scp-method_0029-51" id=
      "index-ssh-_0028with-scp-method_0029-51"></a> Using
      <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> to connect to
      the remote host and <samp><span class=
      "command">scp</span></samp> to transfer files between the
      machines is the best method for securely connecting to a
      remote machine and accessing files.

      <p>The performance of this option is also quite good. It may
      be slower than the inline methods when you often open and
      close small files however. The cost of the cryptographic
      handshake at the start of an <samp><span class=
      "command">scp</span></samp> session can begin to absorb the
      advantage that the lack of encoding and decoding
      presents.</p>

      <p>There are also two variants, <samp><span class=
      "option">scp1</span></samp> and <samp><span class=
      "option">scp2</span></samp>, that call
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh -1</span></samp>&rsquo;
      and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh
      -2</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively. This way, you can
      explicitly select whether you want to use the SSH protocol
      version 1 or 2 to connect to the remote host. (You can also
      specify in <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.ssh/config</span></samp>, the SSH configuration
      file, which protocol should be used, and use the regular
      <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp> method.)</p>

      <p>All the <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>
      based methods support the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; feature where you can specify
      a port number to connect to in the host name. For example,
      the host name <samp><span class="file">host#42</span></samp>
      tells <span class="sc">tramp</span> to specify
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p 42</span></samp>&rsquo; in
      the argument list for <samp><span class=
      "command">ssh</span></samp>, and to specify
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-P 42</span></samp>&rsquo; in
      the argument list for <samp><span class=
      "command">scp</span></samp>.<br /></p>

      "index-ssh-_0028with-sftp-method_0029-55"></a> That is mostly
      the same method as <samp><span class=
      "option">scp</span></samp>, but using <samp><span class=
      "command">sftp</span></samp> as transfer command. So the same
      remarks are valid.

      <p>This command does not work like Ange-FTP, where
      <samp><span class="command">ftp</span></samp> is called
      interactively, and all commands are send from within this
      session. Instead of, <samp><span class=
      "command">ssh</span></samp> is used for login.</p>

      "index-ssh-_0028with-rsync-method_0029-59"></a> Using the
      <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> command to
      connect securely to the remote machine and the
      <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp> command to
      transfer files is almost identical to the <samp><span class=
      "option">scp</span></samp> method.

      <p>While <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp>
      performs much better than <samp><span class=
      "command">scp</span></samp> when transferring files that
      exist on both hosts, this advantage is lost if the file
      exists only on one side of the connection. A file can exists
      on both the remote and local host, when you copy a file
      from/to a remote host. When you just open a file from the
      remote host (or write a file there), a temporary file on the
      local side is kept as long as the corresponding buffer,
      visiting this file, is alive.</p>

      <p>This method supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class=

      "index-ssh-_0028with-scpx-method_0029-63"></a> As you would
      expect, this is similar to <samp><span class=
      "option">scp</span></samp>, only a little different. Whereas
      <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp> opens a normal
      interactive shell on the remote host, this option uses
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh -t -t</span>
      <var>host</var> <span class="samp">-l</span> <var>user</var>
      <span class="samp">/bin/sh</span></samp>&rsquo; to open a
      connection. This is useful for users where the normal login
      shell is set up to ask them a number of questions when
      logging in. This procedure avoids these questions, and just
      gives <span class="sc">tramp</span> a more-or-less `standard'
      login shell to work with.

      <p>This is also useful for Windows users where
      <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>, when invoked
      from an GNU Emacs buffer, tells them that it is not
      allocating a pseudo tty. When this happens, the login shell
      is wont to not print any shell prompt, which confuses
      <span class="sc">tramp</span> mightily.</p>

      of <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp> (for example
      OpenSSH 4) offer an option <samp><span class=
      "option">ControlMaster</span></samp>. This allows
      <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp> to reuse an
      existing <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>
      channel, which increases performance.

      <p>Before you use this method, you shall check whether your
      <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp> implementation
      does support this option. Try from the command line</p>
      <pre class="example">
          ssh localhost -o ControlMaster=yes

      connection by the option <samp><span class=

      "index-smb-method-91"></a> This is another not natural
      <span class="sc">tramp</span> method. It uses the
      <samp><span class="command">smbclient</span></samp> command
      on different Unices in order to connect to an SMB server. An
      SMB server might be a Samba (or CIFS) server on another UNIX
      host or, more interesting, a host running MS Windows. So far,
      it is tested towards MS Windows NT, MS Windows 2000, and MS
      Windows XP.

      <p>The first directory in the localname must be a share name
      on the remote host. Remember, that the <code>$</code>
      character in which default shares usually end, must be
      written <code>$$</code> due to environment variable
      substitution in file names. If no share name is given (i.e.
      remote directory <code>/</code>), all available shares are
      listed.</p>

      <p>Since authorization is done on share level, you will be
      prompted always for a password if you access another share on
      the same host. This can be suppressed by <a href=
      "Password-handling.html#Password-handling">Password
      handling</a>.</p>

      <p>MS Windows uses for authorization both a user name and a
      domain name. Because of this, the <span class=
      "sc">tramp</span> syntax has been extended: you can specify a
      user name which looks like <code>user%domain</code> (the real
      user name, then a percent sign, then the domain name). So, to
      connect to the machine <code>melancholia</code> as user
      <code>daniel</code> of the domain <code>BIZARRE</code>, and
      edit <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> in the
      home directory (share <code>daniel$</code>) I would specify
      the filename <samp><span class="file">/smb
      <!-- /@w -->:daniel%BIZARRE
      <!-- /@w -->@melancholia:/daniel$$/.emacs</span></samp>.</p>

      <p>Depending on the Windows domain configuration, a Windows
      user might be considered as domain user per default. In order
      to connect as local user, the WINS name of that machine must
      be given as domain name. Usually, it is the machine name in
      capital letters. In the example above, the local user
      <code>daniel</code> would be specified as <samp><span class=
      "file">/smb<!-- /@w -->:daniel%MELANCHOLIA
      <!-- /@w -->@melancholia:/daniel$$/.emacs</span></samp>.</p>

      <p>The domain name as well as the user name are optional. If
      no user name is specified at all, the anonymous user (without
      password prompting) is assumed. This is different from all
      other <span class="sc">tramp</span> methods, where in such a
      case the local user name is taken.</p>

      <p>The <samp><span class="option">smb</span></samp> method
      supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.</p>

      <p><strong>Please note:</strong> If GNU Emacs runs locally
      under MS Windows, this method isn't available. Instead of,
      you can use UNC file names like <samp><span class=
      "file">//melancholia/daniel$$/.emacs</span></samp>. The only
      disadvantage is that there's no possibility to specify
      another user name.<br /></p>

      intended to save files there as encrypted message. It could
      be used in case there are no other remote file storages
      available.

      <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> supports both
      <samp><span class="option">imap</span></samp> and
      <samp><span class="option">imaps</span></samp> methods. The
      latter one accesses the IMAP server over ssl.</p>

      <p>Both methods support the port number specification.</p>

      <p>Note, that special handling is needed for declaring a
      passphrase for encryption / decryption of the messages (see

      Using an authentication file</a>).</p>
