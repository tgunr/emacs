  "index-g_t_0040file_007b_002eprofile_007d-file-153" id=

  As explained in the <a href="Overview.html#Overview">Overview</a>
  section, <span class="sc">tramp</span> connects to the remote
  host and talks to the shell it finds there. Of course, when you
  log in, the shell executes its init files. Suppose your init file
  requires you to enter the birth date of your mother; clearly
  <span class="sc">tramp</span> does not know this and hence fails
  to log you in to that host.</p>

  <p>There are different possible strategies for pursuing this
  problem. One strategy is to enable <span class="sc">tramp</span>
  to deal with all possible situations. This is a losing battle,
  since it is not possible to deal with <em>all</em> situations.
  The other strategy is to require you to set up the remote host
  such that it behaves like <span class="sc">tramp</span> expects.
  This might be inconvenient because you have to invest a lot of
  effort into shell setup before you can begin to use <span class=
  "sc">tramp</span>.</p>

  <p>The package, therefore, pursues a combined approach. It tries
  to figure out some of the more common setups, and only requires
  you to avoid really exotic stuff. For example, it looks through a
  list of directories to find some programs on the remote host. And
  also, it knows that it is not obvious how to check whether a file
  exists, and therefore it tries different possibilities. (On some
  hosts and shells, the command <samp><span class="command">test
  -e</span></samp> does the trick, on some hosts the shell builtin
  doesn't work but the program <samp><span class=
  "command">/usr/bin/test -e</span></samp> or <samp><span class=
  "command">/bin/test -e</span></samp> works. And on still other
  hosts, <samp><span class="command">ls -d</span></samp> is the
  right way to do this.)</p>

  <p>Below you find a discussion of a few things that <span class=
  "sc">tramp</span> does not deal with, and that you therefore have
  to set up correctly.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><var>shell-prompt-pattern</var></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-shell_002dprompt_002dpattern-156" id=
      "index-shell_002dprompt_002dpattern-156"></a> After logging
      in to the remote host, <span class="sc">tramp</span> has to
      wait for the remote shell startup to finish before it can
      send commands to the remote shell. The strategy here is to
      wait for the shell prompt. In order to recognize the shell
      prompt, the variable <code>shell-prompt-pattern</code> has to
      be set correctly to recognize the shell prompt on the remote
      host.

      <p>Note that <span class="sc">tramp</span> requires the match
      for <code>shell-prompt-pattern</code> to be at the end of the
      buffer. Many people have something like the following as the
      value for the variable: <code>"^[^&gt;$][&gt;$] *"</code>.
      Now suppose your shell prompt is <code>a &lt;b&gt; c $</code>
      . In this case, <span class="sc">tramp</span> recognizes the
      <code>&gt;</code> character as the end of the prompt, but it
      is not at the end of the buffer.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><var>tramp-shell-prompt-pattern</var></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-tramp_002dshell_002dprompt_002dpattern-157"
    id="index-tramp_002dshell_002dprompt_002dpattern-157"></a> This
    regular expression is used by <span class="sc">tramp</span> in
    the same way as <code>shell-prompt-pattern</code>, to match
    prompts from the remote shell. This second variable exists
    because the prompt from the remote shell might be different
    from the prompt from a local shell &mdash; after all, the whole
    point of <span class="sc">tramp</span> is to log in to remote
    hosts as a different user. The default value of
    <code>tramp-shell-prompt-pattern</code> is the same as the
    default value of <code>shell-prompt-pattern</code>, which is
    reported to work well in many circumstances.<br /></dd>

    <dt><var>tramp-password-prompt-regexp</var></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-tramp_002dpassword_002dprompt_002dregexp-158"
      id=
      "index-tramp_002dpassword_002dprompt_002dregexp-158"></a><a name="index-tramp_002dwrong_002dpasswd_002dregexp-159"
      id="index-tramp_002dwrong_002dpasswd_002dregexp-159"></a>
      During login, <span class="sc">tramp</span> might be forced
      to enter a password or a passphrase. The difference between
      both is that a password is requested from the shell on the
      remote host, while a passphrase is needed for accessing local
      authentication information, like your ssh key.

      <p><var>tramp-password-prompt-regexp</var> handles the
      detection of such requests for English environments. When you
      use another localization of your (local or remote) host, you
      might need to adapt this. Example:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (setq
            tramp-password-prompt-regexp
              (concat
                "^.*"
                (regexp-opt
                  '("passphrase" "Passphrase"
                    ;; English
                    "password" "Password"
                    ;; Deutsch
                    "passwort" "Passwort"
                    ;; Fran&ccedil;ais
                    "mot de passe" "Mot de passe") t)
                ".*:? *"))
</pre>

      <p>In parallel, it might also be necessary to adapt
      <var>tramp-wrong-passwd-regexp</var>.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><samp><span class="command">tset</span></samp> and other
    questions</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-Unix-command-tset-160" id=
      "index-Unix-command-tset-160"></a><a name=
      "index-tset-Unix-command-161" id=
      "index-tset-Unix-command-161"></a> Some people invoke the
      <samp><span class="command">tset</span></samp> program from
      their shell startup scripts which asks the user about the
      terminal type of the shell. Maybe some shells ask other
      questions when they are started. <span class=
      "sc">tramp</span> does not know how to answer these
      questions. There are two approaches for dealing with this
      problem. One approach is to take care that the shell does not
      ask any questions when invoked from <span class=
      "sc">tramp</span>. You can do this by checking the
      <code>TERM</code> environment variable, it will be set to
      <code>dumb</code> when connecting.

      <p><a name="index-tramp_002dterminal_002dtype-162" id=
      "index-tramp_002dterminal_002dtype-162"></a>The variable
      <code>tramp-terminal-type</code> can be used to change this
      value to <code>dumb</code>.</p>

      <p><a name="index-tramp_002dactions_002dbefore_002dshell-163"
      id="index-tramp_002dactions_002dbefore_002dshell-163"></a>The
      other approach is to teach <span class="sc">tramp</span>
      about these questions. See the variable
      <code>tramp-actions-before-shell</code>. Example:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (defconst my-tramp-prompt-regexp
            (concat (regexp-opt '("Enter the birth date of your mother:") t)
                    "\\s-*")
            "Regular expression matching my login prompt question.")

          (defun my-tramp-action (proc vec)
            "Enter \"19000101\" in order to give a correct answer."
            (save-window-excursion
              (with-current-buffer (tramp-get-connection-buffer vec)
                (tramp-message vec 6 "\n%s" (buffer-string))
                (tramp-send-string vec "19000101"))))

          (add-to-list 'tramp-actions-before-shell
                       '(my-tramp-prompt-regexp my-tramp-action))
</pre><br />
    </dd>

    <dt>Environment variables named like users in
    <samp><span class="file">.profile</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>
      If you have a user named frumple and set the variable
      <code>FRUMPLE</code> in your shell environment, then this
      might cause trouble. Maybe rename the variable to
      <code>FRUMPLE_DIR</code> or the like.

      <p>This weird effect was actually reported by a <span class=
      "sc">tramp</span> user!<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Non-Bourne commands in <samp><span class=
    "file">.profile</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>
      After logging in to the remote host, <span class=
      "sc">tramp</span> issues the command <samp><span class=
      "command">exec /bin/sh</span></samp>. (Actually, the command
      is slightly different.) When <samp><span class=
      "command">/bin/sh</span></samp> is executed, it reads some
      init files, such as <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.shrc</span></samp> or <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.profile</span></samp>.

      <p>Now, some people have a login shell which is not
      <code>/bin/sh</code> but a Bourne-ish shell such as bash or
      ksh. Some of these people might put their shell setup into
      the files <samp><span class="file">~/.shrc</span></samp> or
      <samp><span class="file">~/.profile</span></samp>. This way,
      it is possible for non-Bourne constructs to end up in those
      files. Then, <samp><span class="command">exec
      /bin/sh</span></samp> might cause the Bourne shell to barf on
      those constructs.</p>

      <p>As an example, imagine somebody putting <samp><span class=
      "command">export FOO=bar</span></samp> into the file
      <samp><span class="file">~/.profile</span></samp>. The
      standard Bourne shell does not understand this syntax and
      will emit a syntax error when it reaches this line.</p>

      <p>Another example is the tilde (<code>~</code>) character,
      say when adding <samp><span class="file">~/bin</span></samp>
      to <code>PATH</code>. Many Bourne shells will not expand this
      character, and since there is usually no directory whose name
      consists of the single character tilde, strange things will
      happen.</p>

      <p>What can you do about this?</p>

      <p>Well, one possibility is to make sure that everything in
      <samp><span class="file">~/.shrc</span></samp> and
      <samp><span class="file">~/.profile</span></samp> on all
      remote hosts is Bourne-compatible. In the above example,
      instead of <samp><span class="command">export
      FOO=bar</span></samp>, you might use <samp><span class=
      "command">FOO=bar; export FOO</span></samp> instead.</p>

      <p>The other possibility is to put your non-Bourne shell
      setup into some other files. For example, bash reads the file
      <samp><span class="file">~/.bash_profile</span></samp>
      instead of <samp><span class="file">~/.profile</span></samp>,
      if the former exists. So bash aficionados just rename their
      <samp><span class="file">~/.profile</span></samp> to
      <samp><span class="file">~/.bash_profile</span></samp> on all
      remote hosts, and Bob's your uncle.</p>

      <p>The <span class="sc">tramp</span> developers would like to
      circumvent this problem, so if you have an idea about it,
      please tell us. However, we are afraid it is not that simple:
      before saying <samp><span class="command">exec
      /bin/sh</span></samp>, <span class="sc">tramp</span> does not
      know which kind of shell it might be talking to. It could be
      a Bourne-ish shell like ksh or bash, or it could be a csh
      derivative like tcsh, or it could be zsh, or even rc. If the
      shell is Bourne-ish already, then it might be prudent to omit
      the <samp><span class="command">exec /bin/sh</span></samp>
      step. But how to find out if the shell is
      Bourne-ish?<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Interactive shell prompt</dt>

    <dd>
      <span class="sc">tramp</span> redefines the shell prompt in
      order to parse the shell's output robustly. When calling an
      interactive shell by <kbd>M-x shell</kbd>, this doesn't look
      nice.

      <p>You can redefine the shell prompt by checking the
      environment variable <code>INSIDE_EMACS</code>, which is set
      by <span class="sc">tramp</span>, in your startup script
      <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs_SHELLNAME</span></samp>.
      <code>SHELLNAME</code> might be the string <code>bash</code>
      or similar, in case of doubt you could set it the environment
      variable <code>ESHELL</code> in your <samp><span class=
      "file">.emacs</span></samp>:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (setenv "ESHELL" "bash")
</pre>

      <p>Your file <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.emacs_SHELLNAME</span></samp> could contain code
      like</p>
      <pre class="example">
          # Reset the prompt for remote Tramp shells.
          if [ "${INSIDE_EMACS/*tramp*/tramp}" == "tramp" ] ; then
             PS1="[\u@\h \w]$ "
