  <ul>
    <li>Where can I get the latest <span class="sc">tramp</span>?

      <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> is available under the URL
      below.</p>

      <p class="noindent"><a href=
      "ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/</a></p>

      <p class="noindent">There is also a Savannah project
      page.</p>

      <p class="noindent"><a href=
      "http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tramp/">http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tramp/</a></p>
    </li>

    <li>Which systems does it work on?

      <p>The package has been used successfully on GNU Emacs 22,
      GNU Emacs 23, XEmacs 21 (starting with 21.4), and SXEmacs
      22.</p>

      <p>The package was intended to work on Unix, and it really
      expects a Unix-like system on the remote end (except the
      <samp><span class="option">smb</span></samp> and
      <samp><span class="option">imap</span></samp> methods), but
      some people seemed to have some success getting it to work on
      MS Windows XP/Vista/7 GNU Emacs.</p>
    </li>

    <li>How could I speed up <span class="sc">tramp</span>?

      <p>In the backstage, <span class="sc">tramp</span> needs a
      lot of operations on the remote host. The time for
      transferring data from and to the remote host as well as the
      time needed to perform the operations there count. In order
      to speed up <span class="sc">tramp</span>, one could either
      try to avoid some of the operations, or one could try to
      improve their performance.</p>

      <p>Use an external method, like <samp><span class=
      "option">scpc</span></samp>.</p>

      <p>Use caching. This is already enabled by default.
      Information about the remote host as well as the remote files
      are cached for reuse. The information about remote hosts is
      kept in the file specified in
      <code>tramp-persistency-file-name</code>. Keep this file. If
      you are confident, that files on remote hosts are not changed
      out of GNU Emacs' control, set
      <code>remote-file-name-inhibit-cache</code> to
      <code>nil</code>.</p>

      <p>Disable version control. If you access remote files which
      are not under version control, a lot of check operations can
      be avoided by disabling VC. This can be achieved by</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (setq vc-ignore-dir-regexp
                (format "\\(%s\\)\\|\\(%s\\)"
                        vc-ignore-dir-regexp
                        tramp-file-name-regexp))
</pre>

      <p>Disable excessive traces. The default trace level of
      <span class="sc">tramp</span>, defined in the variable
      <code>tramp-verbose</code>, is 3. You should increase this
      level only temporarily, hunting bugs.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span class="sc">tramp</span> does not connect to the remote
      host

      <p>When <span class="sc">tramp</span> does not connect to the
      remote host, there are three reasons heading the bug mailing
      list:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Unknown characters in the prompt

          <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> needs to recognize the
          prompt on the remote machine after execution any command.
          This is not possible, when the prompt contains unknown
          characters like escape sequences for coloring. This
          should be avoided on the remote side. See <a href=
          "Remote-shell-setup.html#Remote-shell-setup">Remote shell
          setup</a>. for setting the regular expression detecting
          the prompt.</p>

          <p>You can check your settings after an unsuccessful
          connection by switching to the <span class=
          "sc">tramp</span> connection buffer <samp><span class=
          "file">*tramp/foo*</span></samp>, setting the cursor at
          the top of the buffer, and applying the expression</p>
          <pre class="example">
               <kbd>M-: (re-search-forward (concat tramp-shell-prompt-pattern "$"))</kbd>
</pre>

          <p>If it fails, or the cursor is not moved at the end of
          the buffer, your prompt is not recognized correctly.</p>

          <p>A special problem is the zsh, which uses left-hand
          side and right-hand side prompts in parallel. Therefore,
          it is necessary to disable the zsh line editor on the
          remote host. You shall add to <samp><span class=
          "file">~/.zshrc</span></samp> the following command:</p>
          <pre class="example">
               [ $TERM = "dumb" ] &amp;&amp; unsetopt zle &amp;&amp; PS1='$ '
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Echoed characters after login

          <p>When the remote machine opens an echoing shell, there
          might be control characters in the welcome message.
          <span class="sc">tramp</span> tries to suppress such
          echoes via the <code>stty -echo</code> command, but
          sometimes this command is not reached, because the echoed
          output has confused <span class="sc">tramp</span>
          already. In such situations it might be helpful to use
          the <samp><span class="option">sshx</span></samp> or
          <samp><span class="option">scpx</span></samp> methods,
          which allocate a pseudo tty. See <a href=
          "Inline-methods.html#Inline-methods">Inline
          methods</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="sc">tramp</span> doesn't transfer strings
          with more than 500 characters correctly

          <p>On some few systems, the implementation of
          <code>process-send-string</code> seems to be broken for
          longer strings. It is reported for HP-UX, FreeBSD and
          Tru64 Unix, for example. This case, you should customize
          the variable <code>tramp-chunksize</code> to 500. For a
          description how to determine whether this is necessary
          see the documentation of
          <code>tramp-chunksize</code>.</p>

          <p>Additionally, it will be useful to set
          <code>file-precious-flag</code> to <code>t</code> for
          <span class="sc">tramp</span> files. Then the file
          contents will be written into a temporary file first,
          which is checked for correct checksum.</p>
          <pre class="lisp">
               (add-hook
                'find-file-hooks
                '(lambda ()
                   (when (file-remote-p default-directory)
                     (set (make-local-variable 'file-precious-flag) t))))
</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span class="sc">tramp</span> does not recognize hung
      <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> sessions

      <p>When your network connection is down, <samp><span class=
      "command">ssh</span></samp> sessions might hang. <span class=
      "sc">tramp</span> cannot detect it safely, because it still
      sees a running <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>
      process. Timeouts cannot be used as well, because it cannot
      be predicted, how long a remote command will last, for
      example when copying very large files.</p>

      <p>Therefore, you must configure the <samp><span class=
      "command">ssh</span></samp> process to die in such a case.
      The following entry in <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.ssh/config</span></samp> would do the job:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          Host *
               ServerAliveInterval 5
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>File name completion does not work with <span class=
    "sc">tramp</span>

      <p>When you log in to the remote machine, do you see the
      output of <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> in
      color? If so, this may be the cause of your problems.</p>

      <p><samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> outputs
      <acronym>ANSI</acronym> escape sequences that your terminal
      emulator interprets to set the colors. These escape sequences
      will confuse <span class="sc">tramp</span> however.</p>

      <p>In your <samp><span class="file">.bashrc</span></samp>,
      <samp><span class="file">.profile</span></samp> or equivalent
      on the remote machine you probably have an alias configured
      that adds the option <samp><span class=
      "option">--color=yes</span></samp> or <samp><span class=
      "option">--color=auto</span></samp>.</p>

      <p>You should remove that alias and ensure that a new login
      <em>does not</em> display the output of <samp><span class=
      "command">ls</span></samp> in color. If you still cannot use
      filename completion, report a bug to the <span class=
      "sc">tramp</span> developers.</p>
    </li>

    <li>File name completion does not work in large directories

      <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> uses globbing for some
      operations. (Globbing means to use the shell to expand
      wildcards such as `*.c'.) This might create long command
      lines, especially in directories with many files. Some shells
      choke on long command lines, or don't cope well with the
      globbing itself.</p>

      <p>If you have a large directory on the remote end, you may
      wish to execute a command like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">ls -d * ..?* &gt; /dev/null</span></samp>&rsquo; and
      see if it hangs. Note that you must first start the right
      shell, which might be <samp><span class=
      "command">/bin/sh</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
      "command">ksh</span></samp> or <samp><span class=
      "command">bash</span></samp>, depending on which of those
      supports tilde expansion.</p>
    </li>

    <li>How can I get notified when <span class="sc">tramp</span>
    file transfers are complete?

      <p>The following snippet can be put in your
      <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file. It
      makes GNU Emacs beep after reading from or writing to the
      remote host.</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (defadvice tramp-handle-write-region
            (after tramp-write-beep-advice activate)
            "Make tramp beep after writing a file."
            (interactive)
            (beep))

          (defadvice tramp-handle-do-copy-or-rename-file
            (after tramp-copy-beep-advice activate)
            "Make tramp beep after copying a file."
            (interactive)
            (beep))

          (defadvice tramp-handle-insert-file-contents
            (after tramp-insert-beep-advice activate)
            "Make tramp beep after inserting a file."
            (interactive)
            (beep))
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>I'ld like to get a Visual Warning when working in a sudo:ed
    context

      <p>When you are working with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">root</span></samp>&rsquo; privileges, it might be
      useful to get an indication in the buffer's modeline. The
      following code, tested with GNU Emacs 22.1, does the job. You
      should put it into your <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.emacs</span></samp>:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (defun my-mode-line-function ()
            (when (string-match "^/su\\(do\\)?:" default-directory)
              (setq mode-line-format
                    (format-mode-line mode-line-format 'font-lock-warning-face))))

          (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'my-mode-line-function)
          (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'my-mode-line-function)
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>I'ld like to see a host indication in the mode line when
    I'm remote

      <p>The following code has been tested with GNU Emacs 22.1.
      You should put it into your <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.emacs</span></samp>:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (defconst my-mode-line-buffer-identification
            (list
             '(:eval
               (let ((host-name
                      (if (file-remote-p default-directory)
                          (tramp-file-name-host
                           (tramp-dissect-file-name default-directory))
                        (system-name))))
                 (if (string-match "^[^0-9][^.]*\\(\\..*\\)" host-name)
                     (substring host-name 0 (match-beginning 1))
                   host-name)))
             ": %12b"))

          (setq-default
           mode-line-buffer-identification
           my-mode-line-buffer-identification)

          (add-hook
           'dired-mode-hook
           '(lambda ()
              (setq
               mode-line-buffer-identification
               my-mode-line-buffer-identification)))
</pre>

      <p>Since GNU Emacs 23.1, the mode line contains an indication
      if <code>default-directory</code> for the current buffer is
      on a remote host. The corresponding tooltip includes the name
      of that host. If you still want the host name as part of the
      mode line, you can use the example above, but the
      <code>:eval</code> clause can be simplified:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
             '(:eval
               (let ((host-name
                      (or (file-remote-p default-directory 'host)
                          (system-name))))
                 (if (string-match "^[^0-9][^.]*\\(\\..*\\)" host-name)
                     (substring host-name 0 (match-beginning 1))
                   host-name)))
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>My remote host does not understand default directory
    listing options

      <p>GNU Emacs computes the <samp><span class=
      "command">dired</span></samp> options depending on the local
      host you are working. If your <samp><span class=
      "command">ls</span></samp> command on the remote host does
      not understand those options, you can change them like
      this:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (add-hook
           'dired-before-readin-hook
           '(lambda ()
              (when (file-remote-p default-directory)
                (setq dired-actual-switches "-al"))))
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>There's this <samp><span class=
    "file">~/.sh_history</span></samp> file on the remote host
    which keeps growing and growing. What's that?

      <p>Sometimes, <span class="sc">tramp</span> starts
      <samp><span class="command">ksh</span></samp> on the remote
      host for tilde expansion. Maybe <samp><span class=
      "command">ksh</span></samp> saves the history by default.
      <span class="sc">tramp</span> tries to turn off saving the
      history, but maybe you have to help. For example, you could
      put this in your <samp><span class=
      "file">.kshrc</span></samp>:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          if [ -f $HOME/.sh_history ] ; then
             /bin/rm $HOME/.sh_history
          fi
          if [ "${HISTFILE-unset}" != "unset" ] ; then
             unset HISTFILE
          fi
          if [ "${HISTSIZE-unset}" != "unset" ] ; then
             unset HISTSIZE
          fi
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>There are longish file names to type. How to shorten this?

      <p>Let's say you need regularly access to <samp><span class=
      "file">/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news
      <!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc</span></samp>,
      which is boring to type again and again. The following
      approaches can be mixed:</p>

      <ol type="1" start="1">
        <li>Use default values for method and user name:

          <p>You can define default methods and user names for
          hosts, (see <a href=
          "Default-Method.html#Default-Method">Default Method</a>,
          see <a href="Default-User.html#Default-User">Default
          User</a>):</p>
          <pre class="lisp">
               (setq tramp-default-method "ssh"
                     tramp-default-user "news")
</pre>

          <p>The file name left to type would be <kbd>C-x C-f
          /news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc</kbd>.</p>

          <p>Note, that there are some useful settings already.
          Accessing your local host as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
          "samp">root</span></samp>&rsquo; user, is possible just
          by <kbd>C-x C-f /su<!-- /@w -->::</kbd>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Use configuration possibilities of your method:

          <p>Several connection methods (i.e. the programs used)
          offer powerful configuration possibilities (see <a href=
          "Customizing-Completion.html#Customizing-Completion">Customizing
          Completion</a>). In the given case, this could be
          <samp><span class="file">~/.ssh/config</span></samp>:</p>
          <pre class="example">
               Host xy
                    HostName news.my.domain
                    User news
</pre>

          <p>The file name left to type would be <kbd>C-x C-f /ssh
          <!-- /@w -->:xy:/opt/news/etc</kbd>. Depending on files
          in your directories, it is even possible to complete the
          host name with <kbd>C-x C-f /ssh:x &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Use environment variables:

          <p>File names typed in the minibuffer can be expanded by
          environment variables. You can set them outside GNU
          Emacs, or even with Lisp:</p>
          <pre class="lisp">
               (setenv "xy" "/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news
<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/")
</pre>

          <p>Then you need simply to type <kbd>C-x C-f $xy
          &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, and here you are. The disadvantage is,
          that you cannot edit the file name, because environment
          variables are not expanded during editing in the
          minibuffer.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Define own keys:

          <p>You can define your own key sequences in GNU Emacs,
          which can be used instead of <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>:</p>
          <pre class="lisp">
               (global-set-key
                [(control x) (control y)]
                (lambda ()
                  (interactive)
                  (find-file
                   (read-file-name
                    "Find Tramp file: "
                    "/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news
<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/"))))
</pre>

          <p>Simply typing <kbd>C-x C-y</kbd> would initialize the
          minibuffer for editing with your beloved file name.</p>

          <p>See also <a href=
          "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/TrampMode">the
          Emacs Wiki</a> for a more comprehensive example.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Define own abbreviation (1):

          <p>It is possible to define an own abbreviation list for
          expanding file names:</p>
          <pre class="lisp">
               (add-to-list
                'directory-abbrev-alist
                '("^/xy" . "/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news
<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/"))
</pre>

          <p>This shortens the file openening command to <kbd>C-x
          C-f /xy &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. The disadvantage is, again,
          that you cannot edit the file name, because the expansion
          happens after entering the file name only.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Define own abbreviation (2):

          <p>The <code>abbrev-mode</code> gives more flexibility
          for editing the minibuffer:</p>
          <pre class="lisp">
               (define-abbrev-table 'my-tramp-abbrev-table
                 '(("xy" "/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news
<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/")))

               (add-hook
                'minibuffer-setup-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (abbrev-mode 1)
                   (setq local-abbrev-table my-tramp-abbrev-table)))

               (defadvice minibuffer-complete
                 (before my-minibuffer-complete activate)
                 (expand-abbrev))

               ;; If you use partial-completion-mode
               (defadvice PC-do-completion
                 (before my-PC-do-completion activate)
                 (expand-abbrev))
</pre>

          <p>After entering <kbd>C-x C-f xy &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>, the
          minibuffer is expanded, and you can continue editing.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Use bookmarks:

          <p>Bookmarks can be used to visit Tramp files or
          directories.</p>

          <p>When you have opened <samp><span class="file">/ssh
          <!-- /@w -->:news
          <!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/</span></samp>,
          you should save the bookmark via <kbd>&lt;menu-bar&gt;
          &lt;edit&gt; &lt;bookmarks&gt; &lt;set&gt;</kbd>.</p>

          <p>Later on, you can always navigate to that bookmark via
          <kbd>&lt;menu-bar&gt; &lt;edit&gt; &lt;bookmarks&gt;
          &lt;jump&gt;</kbd>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Use recent files:

          <p><samp><span class="file">recentf</span></samp>
          remembers visited places.</p>

          <p>You could keep remote file names in the recent list
          without checking their readability through a remote
          access:</p>
          <pre class="lisp">
               (recentf-mode 1)
</pre>

          <p>The list of files opened recently is reachable via
          <kbd>&lt;menu-bar&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;Open
          Recent&gt;</kbd>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Use filecache:

          <p><samp><span class="file">filecache</span></samp>
          remembers visited places. Add the directory into the
          cache:</p>
          <pre class="lisp">
               (eval-after-load "filecache"
                 '(file-cache-add-directory
                   "/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news
<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/"))
</pre>

          <p>Whenever you want to load a file, you can enter
          <kbd>C-x C-f C-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> in the minibuffer. The
          completion is done for the given directory.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Use bbdb:

          <p><samp><span class="file">bbdb</span></samp> has a
          built-in feature for Ange-FTP files, which works also for
          <span class="sc">tramp</span>.</p>

          <p>You need to load <samp><span class=
          "file">bbdb</span></samp>:</p>
          <pre class="lisp">
               (require 'bbdb)
               (bbdb-initialize)
</pre>

          <p>Then you can create a BBDB entry via <kbd>M-x
          bbdb-create-ftp-site</kbd>. Because BBDB is not prepared
          for <span class="sc">tramp</span> syntax, you must
          specify a method together with the user name, when
          needed. Example:</p>
          <pre class="example">
               <kbd>M-x bbdb-create-ftp-site &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
               <b>Ftp Site:</b> news.my.domain &lt;RET&gt;
               <b>Ftp Directory:</b> /opt/news/etc/ &lt;RET&gt;
               <b>Ftp Username:</b> ssh:news &lt;RET&gt;
               <b>Company:</b> &lt;RET&gt;
               <b>Additional Comments:</b> &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

          <p>When you have opened your BBDB buffer, you can access
          such an entry by pressing the key &lt;F&gt;.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>I would like to thank all <span class="sc">tramp</span>
      users, who have contributed to the different recipes!</p>
    </li>

    <li>How can I use <span class="sc">tramp</span> to connect to a
    remote GNU Emacs session?

      <p>You can configure Emacs Client doing this.</p>

      <p>On the remote host, you start the Emacs Server:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (require 'server)
          (setq server-host (system-name)
                server-use-tcp t)
          (server-start)
</pre>

      <p>Make sure, that the result of <code>(system-name)</code>
      can be resolved on your local host; otherwise you might use a
      hard coded IP address.</p>

      <p>The resulting file <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.emacs.d/server/server</span></samp> must be copied
      to your local host, at the same location. You can call then
      the Emacs Client from the command line:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          emacsclient /ssh<!-- /@w -->:user
<!-- /@w -->@host:/file/to/edit
</pre>

      <p><code>user</code> and <code>host</code> shall be related
      to your local host.</p>

      <p>If you want to use Emacs Client also as editor for other
      programs, you could write a script <samp><span class=
      "file">emacsclient.sh</span></samp>:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          #!/bin/sh
          emacsclient /ssh<!-- /@w -->:$(whoami)
<!-- /@w -->@$(hostname --fqdn):$1
</pre>

      <p>Then you must set the environment variable
      <code>EDITOR</code> pointing to that script:</p>
      <pre class="example">
          export EDITOR=/path/to/emacsclient.sh
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>How can I disable <span class="sc">tramp</span>?

      <p>Shame on you, why did you read until now?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you just want to have Ange-FTP as default remote
        files access package, you should apply the following code:
          <pre class="lisp">
               (setq tramp-default-method "ftp")
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>In order to disable <span class="sc">tramp</span> (and
        Ange-FTP), you must set <code>tramp-mode</code> to
        <code>nil</code>:
          <pre class="lisp">
               (setq tramp-mode nil)
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Unloading <span class="sc">tramp</span> can be achieved
        by applying <kbd>M-x tramp-unload-tramp</kbd>. This resets
        also the Ange-FTP plugins.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
