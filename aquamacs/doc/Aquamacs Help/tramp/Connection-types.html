  <h3 class="section">4.1 Types of connections made to remote
  machines.</h3>

  <p><a name="index-connection-types_002c-overview-10" id=
  "index-connection-types_002c-overview-10"></a> There are two
  basic types of transfer methods, each with its own advantages and
  limitations. Both types of connection make use of a remote shell
  access program such as <samp><span class=
  "command">rsh</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">ssh</span></samp> or <samp><span class=
  "command">telnet</span></samp> to connect to the remote
  machine.</p>

  <p>This connection is used to perform many of the operations that
  <span class="sc">tramp</span> requires to make the remote file
  system transparently accessible from the local machine. It is
  only when visiting files that the methods differ.</p>

  <p><a name="index-inline-methods-11" id=
  "index-inline-methods-11"></a><a name="index-external-methods-12"
  id="index-external-methods-12"></a><a name=
  "index-methods_002c-inline-13" id=
  "index-methods_002c-inline-13"></a><a name=
  "index-methods_002c-external-14" id=
  "index-methods_002c-external-14"></a>Loading or saving a remote
  file requires that the content of the file be transfered between
  the two machines. The content of the file can be transfered using
  one of two methods: the <dfn>inline method</dfn> over the same
  connection used to log in to the remote machine, or the
  <dfn>external method</dfn> through another connection using a
  remote copy program such as <samp><span class=
  "command">rcp</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">scp</span></samp> or <samp><span class=
  "command">rsync</span></samp>.</p>

  <p>The performance of the external methods is generally better
  than that of the inline methods, at least for large files. This
  is caused by the need to encode and decode the data when
  transferring inline.</p>

  <p>The one exception to this rule are the <samp><span class=
  "command">scp</span></samp> based transfer methods. While these
  methods do see better performance when actually transferring
  files, the overhead of the cryptographic negotiation at startup
  may drown out the improvement in file transfer times.</p>

  <p>External methods should be configured such a way that they
  don't require a password (with <samp><span class=
  "command">ssh-agent</span></samp>, or such alike). Modern
  <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> implementations
  offer options to reuse existing <samp><span class=
  "command">ssh</span></samp> connections, see method
  <samp><span class="command">scpc</span></samp>. If it isn't
  possible, you should consider <a href=
  "Password-handling.html#Password-handling">Password handling</a>,
  otherwise you will be prompted for a password every copy
  action.</p>
