  <h3 class="section">1.2 What's New in Version 4.0</h3>

  <p>Version 4.0 contains the following enhancements:</p>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>Scroll margins at the top and bottom of the window are now
    supported. (The design was copied from <samp><span class=
    "file">tpu-extras.el</span></samp>.) By default, this feature
    is enabled with the top margin set to 10% of the window and the
    bottom margin set to 15% of the window. To change these
    settings, you can invoke the function
    <code>edt-set-scroll-margins</code> in your
      <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. For
      example, the following line
      <pre class="example">
          (edt-set-scroll-margins "20%" "25%")
</pre>

      <p class="noindent">sets the top margin to 20% of the window
      and the bottom margin to 25% of the window. To disable this
      feature, set each margin to 0%. You can also invoke
      <code>edt-set-scroll-margins</code> interactively while EDT
      Emulation is active to change the settings for that
      session.</p>

      <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Another way to set the
      scroll margins is to use the Emacs customization feature to
      set the following two variables directly:
      <code>edt-top-scroll-margin</code> and
      <code>edt-bottom-scroll-margin</code>.</p>

      <p>Enter the Emacs <code>customize</code> command. First
      select the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">Editing</span></samp>&rsquo; group and then select the
      &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">Emulations</span></samp>&rsquo; group. Finally, select
      the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edt</span></samp>&rsquo;
      group and follow the directions.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">SUBS</span></samp>&rsquo; command is now supported and
    bound to <kbd>GOLD-Enter</kbd> by default. (This design was
    copied from <samp><span class="file">tpu-edt.el</span></samp>.)
    Note, in earlier versions of EDT Emulation,
    <kbd>GOLD-Enter</kbd> was assigned to the Emacs function
    <code>query-replace</code>. The binding of
    <code>query-replace</code> has been moved to <kbd>GOLD-/</kbd>.
    If you prefer to restore <code>query-replace</code> to
    <kbd>GOLD-Enter</kbd>, then use an EDT user customization file,
    <samp><span class="file">edt-user.el</span></samp>, to do this
    (see <a href=
    "Customizing.html#Customizing">Customizing</a>).</li>

    <li>EDT Emulation now also works in XEmacs, including the
    highlighting of selected text.</li>

    <li>If you access a workstation using an X Server, observe that
    the initialization file generated by <samp><span class=
    "file">edt-mapper.el</span></samp> will now contain the name of
    the X Server vendor. This is a convenience for those who have
    access to their Unix account from more than one type of X
    Server. Since different X Servers typically require different
    EDT emulation initialization files, <samp><span class=
    "file">edt-mapper.el</span></samp> will now generate these
    different initialization files and save them with different
    names. Then, the correct initialization file for the particular
    X server in use is loaded correctly automatically.</li>

    <li>Also, <samp><span class="file">edt-mapper.el</span></samp>
    is now capable of binding an <acronym>ASCII</acronym> key
    sequence, providing the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> key sequence
    prefix is already known by Emacs to be a prefix. As a result of
    providing this support, some terminal/keyboard/window system
    configurations, which don't have a complete set of sensible
    function key bindings built into Emacs in
    <code>function-key-map</code>, can still be configured for use
    with EDT Emulation. (Note: In a few rare circumstances this
    does not work properly. In particular, it does not work if a
    subset of the leading <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in a
    key sequence are recognized by Emacs as having an existing
    binding. For example, if the keypad 7 (&lt;KP7&gt;) key
    generates the sequence &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&lt;ESC&gt;Ow</span></samp>&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&lt;ESC&gt;O</span></samp>&rsquo; is already bound to a
    function, pressing &lt;KP7&gt; when told to do so by
    <samp><span class="file">edt-mapper.el</span></samp> will
    result in <samp><span class="file">edt-mapper.el</span></samp>
    incorrectly mapping &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&lt;ESC&gt;O</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lt;KP7&gt; and
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo; to
    &lt;KP8&gt;. If something like this happens to you, it is
    probably a bug in the support for your keyboard within Emacs
    <strong>or</strong> a bug in the Unix termcap/terminfo support
    for your terminal <strong>or</strong> a bug in the terminal
    emulation software you are using.)</li>

    <li>The <code>edt-quit</code> function (bound to
    <kbd>GOLD-q</kbd> by default) has been modified to warn the
    user when file-related buffer modifications exist. It now
    cautions the user that those modifications will be lost if the
    user quits without saving those buffers.</li>
