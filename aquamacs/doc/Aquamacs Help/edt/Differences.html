  <h2 class="chapter">5 How Does this EDT Emulation Differ from
  Real EDT?</h2>

  <p>In general, you will find that this emulation of EDT
  replicates most, but not all, of EDT's most used Keypad Mode
  editing functions and behavior. It is not perfect, but most EDT
  users who have tried the emulation agree that it is quite good
  enough to make it easy for die-hard EDT users to move over to
  using GNU Emacs.</p>

  <p>Here's a list of the most important differences between EDT
  and this GNU Emacs EDT Emulation. The list is short but you must
  be aware of these differences if you are to use the EDT Emulation
  effectively.</p>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>Entering repeat counts works a little differently than in
    EDT.

      <p>EDT allows users to enter a repeat count before entering a
      command that accepts repeat counts. For example, when using
      the real EDT, pressing these three keys in sequence,
      <kbd>GOLD 5 KP1</kbd>, will move the cursor in the current
      direction 5 words. This does <strong>not</strong> work in
      Emacs!</p>

      <p>Emacs provides two ways to enter repeat counts and neither
      involves using the &lt;GOLD&gt; key. First, repeat counts can
      be entered in Emacs by using the &lt;ESC&gt; key. For
      example, pressing these keys in sequence, <kbd>ESC 1 0
      KP1</kbd>, will move the cursor in the current direction 10
      words. Second, Emacs provides another command called
      <code>universal-argument</code> that can be used to do the
      same thing. Normally, in Emacs has this bound to
      <kbd>C-u</kbd>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>EDT's line mode commands and nokeypad mode commands are
    <strong>not</strong> supported (with one important exception;
    see item 8 in <a href=
    "Highlights.html#Highlights">Highlights</a>). Although, at
    first, this may seem like a big omission, the set of built-in
    Emacs commands provides a much richer set of capabilities which
    more than make up for this omission.

      <p>To enter Emacs commands not bound to keys, you can press
      <kbd>GOLD KP7</kbd> or the &lt;DO&gt; key. Emacs will display
      its own command prompt "M-x". This stands for the keypress
      <kbd>Meta-x</kbd>, where &lt;Meta&gt; is a special shift key.
      The &lt;Alt&gt; key is often mapped to behave as a
      &lt;Meta&gt; key. So, you can also invoke this prompt by
      pressing <kbd>Meta-x</kbd>. Typing the sequence <kbd>ESC
      x</kbd> will also invoke the prompt.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Selected text is highlighted <strong>only</strong> on
    systems where Emacs supports the highlighting of text.</li>

    <li>Just like in TPU/EVE, the &lt;ENTER&gt; key is
    <strong>not</strong> used to terminate input when the editor
    prompts you for input. The &lt;RETURN&gt; key is used, instead.
    (&lt;KP4&gt; and &lt;KP5&gt; (the direction keys) do terminate
    input for the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">FIND</span></samp>&rsquo; command, just like in EDT,
    however.)</li>
  </ol>
