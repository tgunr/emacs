  <h2 class="chapter">6 Some Highlights, and Comparisons to the
  Original Emacs EDT Emulation</h2>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>The EDT define key command is supported
    (<code>edt-define-key</code>) and is bound to <kbd>C-k</kbd> in
    the default EDT mode when EDT control sequence bindings are
    enabled, or when the sample <samp><span class=
    "file">edt-user.el</span></samp> customization file is used.
    The TPU/EVE learn command is supported but not bound to a key
    in the default EDT mode but is bound in the sample
    <samp><span class="file">edt-user.el</span></samp> file.

      <p>Unlike the TPU/EVE learn command, which uses one key to
      begin the learn sequence, <kbd>C-l</kbd>, and another command
      to remember the sequence, <kbd>C-r</kbd>, this version of the
      learn command (<code>edt-learn</code>) serves as a toggle to
      both begin and to remember the learn sequence.</p>

      <p>Many users who change the meaning of a key with the define
      key and the learn commands, would like to be able to restore
      the original key binding without having to quit and restart
      emacs. So a restore key command is provided to do just that.
      When invoked, it prompts you to press the key to which you
      wish the last replaced key definition restored. It is bound
      to <kbd>GOLD C-k</kbd> in the default EDT mode when EDT
      control sequence bindings are enabled or the sample
      <samp><span class="file">edt-user.el</span></samp>
      customization file is used.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Direction support is fully supported.</li>

    <li>All original Emacs bindings are fully restored when EDT
    emulation is turned off. So, if a fellow worker comes over to
    your terminal to help you with a software problem, for example,
    and is completely confused by your EDT emulation bindings, just
    enter the command, <code>edt-emulation-off</code>, at the
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-x</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt
    and the original Emacs bindings will be restored. To resume the
    EDT emulation, just enter <code>edt-emulation-on</code>.</li>

    <li>User custom EDT bindings are kept separate from the default
    EDT bindings. One can toggle back and forth between the custom
    EDT bindings and default EDT bindings.</li>

    <li>The Emacs functions in <samp><span class=
    "file">edt.el</span></samp> attempt to emulate, where
    practical, the exact behavior of the corresponding EDT keypad
    mode commands. In a few cases, the emulation is not exact, but
    we hope you will agree it is close enough. In a very few cases,
    we chose to use the Emacs way of handling things. As mentioned
    earlier, we do not emulate the EDT &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">SUBS</span></samp>&rsquo; command. Instead, we chose to
    use the Emacs <code>query-replace</code> function, which we
    find to be easier to use.</li>

    <li>Emacs uses the regexp assigned to
    <code>page-delimiter</code> to determine what marks a page
    break. This is normally &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">^\f</span></samp>&rsquo;, which causes the
    <code>edt-page</code> command to ignore form feeds not located
    at the beginning of a line. To emulate the EDT
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PAGE</span></samp>&rsquo;
    command exactly, page-delimiter is set to
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\f</span></samp>&rsquo; when
    EDT emulation is turned on, and restored to
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^\f</span></samp>&rsquo; when
    EDT emulation is turned off. But, since some users prefer the
    Emacs definition of a page break, or may wish to preserve a
    customized definition of page break, one can override the EDT
    definition by placing
      <pre class="example">
          (setq edt-keep-current-page-delimiter t)
</pre>

      <p class="noindent">in your <samp><span class=
      "file">.emacs</span></samp> file. Or, you can used the Emacs
      customize command to change its setting.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The EDT definition of a section of a terminal window is
    hardwired to be 16 lines of its one-and-only 24-line window
    (the EDT &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">SECT</span></samp>&rsquo; command bound to &lt;KP8&gt;).
    That's two-thirds of the window at a time. Since Emacs, like
    TPU/EVE, can handle multiple windows of sizes of other than 24
    lines, the definition of section used here has been modified to
    two-thirds of the current window. (There is also an
    <code>edt-scroll-window</code> function which you may prefer
    over the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">SECT</span></samp>&rsquo; emulation.)</li>

    <li>Cursor movement and deletion involving word entities is
    identical to EDT. This, above all else, gives the die-hard EDT
    user a sense of being at home. Also, an emulation of EDT's
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SET ENTITY
    WORD</span></samp>&rsquo; command is provided, for those users
    who like to customize movement by a word at a time to their own
    liking.</li>

    <li>EDT's &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">FIND</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">FNDNXT</span></samp>&rsquo; are supported.</li>

    <li>EDT's &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">APPEND</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">REPLACE</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SUBS</span></samp>&rsquo;
    commands are supported.</li>

    <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">CHNGCASE</span></samp>&rsquo; is supported. It works on
    individual characters or selected text, if
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SELECT</span></samp>&rsquo; is
    active. In addition, two new commands are provided:
    <code>edt-lowercase</code> and <code>edt-uppercase</code>. They
    work on individual <strong>words</strong> or selected text, if
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SELECT</span></samp>&rsquo; is
    active.</li>

    <li>Form feed and tab insert commands are supported.</li>

    <li>A new command, <code>edt-duplicate-word</code>, is
    provided. If you experiment with it, you might find it to be
    surprisingly useful and may wonder how you ever got along
    without it! It is assigned to <kbd>C-j</kbd> in the sample
    <samp><span class="file">edt-user.el</span></samp>
    customization file.</li>

    <li>TPU/EVE's Rectangular Cut and Paste functions (originally
    from the EVE-Plus package) are supported. But unlike the
    TPU/EVE versions, these here support both insert and overwrite
    modes. The seven rectangular functions are bound to &lt;F7&gt;,
    &lt;F8&gt;, <kbd>GOLD-F8</kbd>, &lt;F9&gt;, <kbd>GOLD-F9</kbd>,
    &lt;F10&gt;, and <kbd>GOLD-F10</kbd> in the default EDT
    mode.</li>

    <li>The original EDT emulation package set up many default
    regular and GOLD bindings. We tried to preserve most (but not
    all!) of these, so users of the original emulation package will
    feel more at home.

      <p>Nevertheless, there are still many GOLD key sequences
      which are not bound to any functions. These are prime
      candidates to use for your own customizations.</p>

      <p>Also, there are several commands in <samp><span class=
      "file">edt.el</span></samp> not bound to any key. So, you
      will find it worthwhile to look through <samp><span class=
      "file">edt.el</span></samp> for functions you may wish to add
      to your personal customized bindings.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The VT200/VT300 series terminals steal the function keys
    &lt;F1&gt; to &lt;F5&gt; for their own use. These do not
    generate signals which are sent to the host. So,
    <samp><span class="file">edt.el</span></samp> does not assign
    any default bindings to &lt;F1&gt; through &lt;F5&gt;.

      <p>In addition, our VT220 terminals generate an interrupt
      when the &lt;F6&gt; key is pressed (&lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">^C</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">^Y</span></samp>&rsquo;, can't remember which) and not
      the character sequence documented in the manual. So, binding
      Emacs commands to &lt;F6&gt; will not work if your terminal
      behaves the same way.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The VT220 terminal has no &lt;ESC&gt;, &lt;BS&gt;, nor
    &lt;LF&gt; keys, as does a VT100. So the default EDT bindings
    adopt the standard DEC convention of having the &lt;F11&gt;,
    &lt;F12&gt;, and &lt;F13&gt; keys, on a VT200 series (and
    above) terminal, assigned to the same EDT functions that are
    bound to &lt;ESC&gt;, &lt;BS&gt;, and &lt;LF&gt; on a VT100
    terminal.</li>

    <li>Each user, through the use of a private <samp><span class=
    "file">edt-user.el</span></samp> file, can customize, very
    easily, personal EDT emulation bindings.</li>

    <li>The EDT &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">SELECT</span></samp>&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RESET</span></samp>&rsquo;
      functions are supported. However, unlike EDT, pressing
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RESET</span></samp>&rsquo; to
      cancel text selection does <strong>not</strong> reset the
      existing setting of the current direction.

      <p>We also provide a TPU/EVE like version of the single
      &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">SELECT/RESET</span></samp>&rsquo; function, called
      <code>edt-toggle-select</code>, which makes the EDT
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SELECT</span></samp>&rsquo;
      function into a toggle on/off switch. That is, if selection
      is on, pressing &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">SELECT</span></samp>&rsquo; again turns selection off
      (cancels selection). This function is used in the sample
      <samp><span class="file">edt-user.el</span></samp>
      customization file.</p>
    </li>

    <li>EDT scroll margins are supported, but are disabled by
    default. (<a href="Scroll-margins.html#Scroll-margins">Scroll
    margins</a> for instructions on how to enable them.)</li>
