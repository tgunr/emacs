  <h3 class="section">4.1 Sample Session</h3>

  <p>This is an example ERC session which shows how to connect to
  the #emacs channel on Freenode. Another IRC channel on Freenode
  that may be of interest is #erc, which is a channel where ERC
  users and developers hang out.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Connect to Freenode

      <p>Run <kbd>M-x erc</kbd>. Use &ldquo;irc.freenode.net&rdquo;
      as the IRC server, &ldquo;6667&rdquo; as the port, and choose
      a nickname.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Get used to the interface

      <p>Switch to the &ldquo;irc.freenode.net:6667&rdquo; buffer,
      if you're not already there. You will see first some messages
      about checking for ident, and then a bunch of other messages
      that describe the current IRC server.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Join the #emacs channel

      <p>In that buffer, type &ldquo;/join SPC #emacs&rdquo; and
      hit <kbd>RET</kbd>. Depending on how you've set up ERC,
      either a new buffer for &ldquo;#emacs&rdquo; will be
      displayed, or a new buffer called &ldquo;#emacs&rdquo; will
      be created in the background. If the latter, switch to the
      &ldquo;#emacs&rdquo; buffer. You will see the channel topic
      and a list of the people who are currently on the
      channel.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Register your nickname with Freenode

      <p>If you would like to be able to talk with people privately
      on the Freenode network, you will have to
      &ldquo;register&rdquo; your nickname. To do so, switch to the
      &ldquo;irc.freenode.net:6667&rdquo; buffer and type
      &ldquo;/msg NickServ register &lt;password&gt;&rdquo;,
      replacing &ldquo;&lt;password&gt;&rdquo; with your desired
      password. It should tell you that the operation was
      successful.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Talk to people in the channel

      <p>If you switch back to the &ldquo;#emacs&rdquo; buffer, you
      can type a message, and everyone on the channel will see
      it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Open a query buffer to talk to someone

      <p>If you want to talk with someone in private (this should
      usually not be done for technical help, only for personal
      questions), type &ldquo;/query &lt;nick&gt;&rdquo;, replacing
      &ldquo;&lt;nick&gt;&rdquo; with the nickname of the person
      you would like to talk to. Depending on how ERC is set up,
      you will either see a new buffer with the name of the person,
      or such a buffer will be created in the background and you
      will have to switch to it. Begin typing messages, and you
      will be able to have a conversation.</p>

      <p>Note that if the other person is not registered, you will
      not be able to talk with them.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
