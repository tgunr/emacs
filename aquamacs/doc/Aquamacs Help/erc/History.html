  <h2 class="chapter">9 History</h2>

  <p><a name="index-history_002c-of-ERC-59" id=
  "index-history_002c-of-ERC-59"></a> ERC was originally written by
  Alexander L. Belikoff <a href=
  "mailto:abel@bfr.co.il">abel@bfr.co.il</a> and Sergey Berezin
  <a href=
  "mailto:sergey.berezin@cs.cmu.edu">sergey.berezin@cs.cmu.edu</a>.
  They stopped development around December 1999. Their last
  released version was ERC 2.0.</p>

  <p>P.S.: If one of the original developers of ERC reads this,
  we'd like to receive additional information for this file and
  hear comments in general.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>2001

      <p>In June 2001, Mario Lang <a href=
      "mailto:mlang@delysid.org">mlang@delysid.org</a> and Alex
      Schroeder <a href="mailto:alex@gnu.org">alex@gnu.org</a> took
      over development and created a ERC Project at <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/projects/erc">http://sourceforge.net/projects/erc</a>.</p>

      <p>In reaction to a mail about the new ERC development
      effort, Sergey Berezin said, &ldquo;First of all, I'm glad
      that my version of ERC is being used out there. The thing is,
      I do not have free time and enough incentive anymore to work
      on ERC, so I would be happy if you guys take over the project
      entirely.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>So we happily hacked away on ERC, and soon after
      (September 2001) released the next "stable" version, 2.1.</p>

      <p>Most of the development of the new ERC happened on #emacs
      on irc.openprojects.net. Over time, many people contributed
      code, ideas, bugfixes, and a lot of alpha/beta/gamma
      testing.</p>

      <p>See the <samp><span class="file">CREDITS</span></samp>
      file for a list of contributors.</p>
    </li>

    <li>2003

      <p>ERC 3.0 was released.</p>
    </li>

    <li>2004

      <p>ERC 4.0 was released.</p>
    </li>

    <li>2005

      <p>ERC 5.0 was released. Michael Olson <a href=
      "mailto:mwolson@gnu.org">mwolson@gnu.org</a> became the
      release manager and eventually the maintainer.</p>

      <p>After some discussion between him and the Emacs
      developers, it was decided to include ERC in Emacs.</p>
    </li>

    <li>2006

      <p>ERC 5.1 was released. It was subsequently included in
      Emacs 22.</p>

      <p>ERC became an official GNU project, and development moved
      to <a href=
      "http://sv.gnu.org/projects/erc">http://sv.gnu.org/projects/erc</a>.
      We switched to using GNU Arch as our revision control system.
      Our mailing list address changed as well.</p>
    </li>

    <li>2007

      <p>We switched to using git for our version control
      system.</p>
    </li>
