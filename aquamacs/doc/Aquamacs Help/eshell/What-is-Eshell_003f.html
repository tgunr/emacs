  <h2 class="chapter">1 What is Eshell?</h2>

  <p><a name="index-what-is-Eshell_003f-1" id=
  "index-what-is-Eshell_003f-1"></a><a name=
  "index-Eshell_002c-what-it-is-2" id=
  "index-Eshell_002c-what-it-is-2"></a> Eshell is a <dfn>command
  shell</dfn> written in Emacs Lisp. Everything it does, it uses
  Emacs' facilities to do. This means that Eshell is as portable as
  Emacs itself. It also means that cooperation with Lisp code is
  natural and seamless.</p>

  <p>What is a command shell? To properly understand the role of a
  shell, it's necessary to visualize what a computer does for you.
  Basically, a computer is a tool; in order to use that tool, you
  must tell it what to do&mdash;or give it &ldquo;commands.&rdquo;
  These commands take many forms, such as clicking with a mouse on
  certain parts of the screen. But that is only one form of command
  input.</p>

  <p>By far the most versatile way to express what you want the
  computer to do is by using an abbreviated language called
  <dfn>script</dfn>. In script, instead of telling the computer,
  &ldquo;list my files, please&rdquo;, one writes a standard
  abbreviated command word&mdash;&lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">ls</span></samp>&rsquo;. Typing &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">ls</span></samp>&rsquo; in a command shell is a script way
  of telling the computer to list your files.<a rel="footnote"
  href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

  <p>The real flexibility of this approach is apparent only when
  you realize that there are many, many different ways to list
  files. Perhaps you want them sorted by name, sorted by date, in
  reverse order, or grouped by type. Most graphical browsers have
  simple ways to express this. But what about showing only a few
  files, or only files that meet a certain criteria? In very
  complex and specific situations, the request becomes too
  difficult to express using a mouse or pointing device. It is just
  these kinds of requests that are easily solved using a command
  shell.</p>

  <p>For example, what if you want to list every Word file on your
  hard drive, larger than 100 kilobytes in size, and which hasn't
  been looked at in over six months? That is a good candidate list
  for deletion, when you go to clean up your hard drive. But have
  you ever tried asking your computer for such a list? There is no
  way to do it! At least, not without using a command shell.</p>

  <p>The role of a command shell is to give you more control over
  what your computer does for you. Not everyone needs this amount
  of control, and it does come at a cost: Learning the necessary
  script commands to express what you want done. A complicated
  query, such as the example above, takes time to learn. But if you
  find yourself using your computer frequently enough, it is more
  than worthwhile in the long run. Any tool you use often deserves
  the time spent learning to master it. <a rel="footnote" href=

    <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1" id=
    "fn-1">1</a>]</small> This is comparable to viewing the
    contents of a folder using a graphical display.</p>

    <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2" id=
    "fn-2">2</a>]</small> For the understandably curious, here is
    what that command looks like: But don't let it fool you; once
    you know what's going on, it's easier than it looks: <code>ls
    -lt **/*.doc(Lk+50aM+5)</code>.</p>
