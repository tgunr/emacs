  "index-known-bugs-20"></a><a name="index-bugs_002c-known-21" id=
  "index-bugs_002c-known-21"></a> Below is complete list of known
  problems with Eshell version 2.4.2, which is the version included
  with Emacs 22.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Documentation incomplete<br /></dt>

    <dt>Differentiate between aliases and functions</dt>

    <dd>
      Allow for a bash-compatible syntax, such as:
      <pre class="example">
          alias arg=blah
          function arg () { blah $* }
</pre><br />
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">for i in 1 2 3 { grep -q a
    b &amp;&amp; *echo has it } | wc -l</span></samp>&rsquo;
    outputs result after prompt</dt>

    <dd>In fact, piping to a process from a looping construct
    doesn't work in general. If I change the call to
    <code>eshell-copy-handles</code> in
    <code>eshell-rewrite-for-command</code> to use
    <code>eshell-protect</code>, it seems to work, but the output
    occurs after the prompt is displayed. The whole structured
    command thing is too complicated at present.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Error with <samp><span class="command">bc</span></samp> in
    <code>eshell-test</code></dt>

    <dd>On some XEmacs system, the subprocess interaction test
    fails inexplicably, although <samp><span class=
    "command">bc</span></samp> works fine at the command
    prompt.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Eshell does not delete <samp><span class=
    "file">*Help*</span></samp> buffers in XEmacs 21.1.8+</dt>

    <dd>In XEmacs 21.1.8, the <samp><span class=
    "file">*Help*</span></samp> buffer has been renamed such that
    multiple instances of the <samp><span class=
    "file">*Help*</span></samp> buffer can exist.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Pcomplete sometimes gets stuck</dt>

    <dd>You press &lt;TAB&gt;, but no completions appear, even
    though the directory has matching files. This behavior is
    rare.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">grep python $&lt;rpm
    -qa&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; doesn't work, but using
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*grep</span></samp>&rsquo;
    does</dt>

    <dd>This happens because the <code>grep</code> Lisp function
    returns immediately, and then the asynchronous
    <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> process expects
    to examine the temporary file, which has since been
    deleted.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Problem with C-r repeating text</dt>

    <dd>If the text <em>before point</em> reads "./run", and you
    type <kbd>C-r r u n</kbd>, it will repeat the line for every
    character typed.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Backspace doesn't scroll back after continuing (in smart
    mode)</dt>

    <dd>Hitting space during a process invocation, such as
    <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, will cause it
    to track the bottom of the output; but backspace no longer
    scrolls back.<br /></dd>

    <dt>It's not possible to fully <code>unload-feature</code>
    Eshell<br /></dt>

    <dt>Menu support was removed, but never put back<br /></dt>

    <dt>Using C-p and C-n with rebind gets into a locked state</dt>

    <dd>This happened a few times in Emacs 21, but has been
    unreproducible since.<br /></dd>

    <dt>If an interactive process is currently running,
    <kbd>M-!</kbd> doesn't work<br /></dt>

    <dt>Use a timer instead of <code>sleep-for</code> when killing
    child processes<br /></dt>

    <dt>Piping to a Lisp function is not supported</dt>

    <dd>Make it so that the Lisp command on the right of the pipe
    is repeatedly called with the input strings as arguments. This
    will require changing <code>eshell-do-pipeline</code> to handle
    non-process targets.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Input redirection is not supported</dt>

    <dd>See the above entry.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Problem running <samp><span class=
    "command">less</span></samp> without arguments on Windows</dt>

    <dd>
      The result in the Eshell buffer is:
      <pre class="example">
          Spawning child process: invalid argument
</pre>

      <p>Also a new <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp>
      buffer was created with nothing in it<small class=
      "dots">...</small> (presumably this holds the output of
      <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp>).</p>

      <p>If <samp><span class="command">less.exe</span></samp> is
      invoked from the Eshell command line, the expected output is
      written to the buffer.</p>

      <p>Note that this happens on NT-Emacs 20.6.1 on Windows 2000.
      The term.el package and the supplied shell both use the
      <samp><span class="command">cmdproxy</span></samp> program
      for running shells.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Implement &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">-r</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">-n</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">-s</span></samp>&rsquo; switches for <samp><span class=
    "command">cp</span></samp><br /></dt>

    <dt>Make <kbd>M-5 M-x eshell</kbd> switch to
    &ldquo;*eshell&lt;5&gt;*&rdquo;, creating if need be<br /></dt>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mv</span> <var>dir</var>
    <var>file</var><span class="samp">.tar</span></samp>&rsquo;
    does not remove directories</dt>

    <dd>This is because the tar option &ndash;remove-files doesn't
    do so. Should it be Eshell's job?<br /></dd>

    <dt>Bind <code>standard-output</code> and
    <code>standard-error</code></dt>

    <dd>This would be so that if a Lisp function calls
    <code>print</code>, everything will happen as it should (albeit
    slowly).<br /></dd>

    <dt>When an extension module fails to load,
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cd /</span></samp>&rsquo; gives
    a Lisp error<br /></dt>

    <dt>If a globbing pattern returns one match, should it be a
    list?<br /></dt>

    <dt>Make sure syntax table is correct in Eshell mode</dt>

    <dd>So that <kbd>M-DEL</kbd> acts in a predictable manner,
    etc.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Allow all Eshell buffers to share the same history and
    list-dir<br /></dt>

    <dt>There is a problem with script commands that output to
    <samp><span class="file">/dev/null</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>If a script file, somewhere in the middle, uses
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;
    /dev/null</span></samp>&rsquo;, output from all subsequent
    commands is swallowed.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Split up parsing of text after &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; in <samp><span class=
    "file">esh-var.el</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>Make it similar to the way that <samp><span class=
    "file">esh-arg.el</span></samp> is structured. Then add parsing
    of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">$[?\n]</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>After pressing <kbd>M-RET</kbd>, redisplay before running
    the next command<br /></dt>

    <dt>Argument predicates and modifiers should work anywhere in a
    path</dt>

    <dd>
      <pre class="example">
          /usr/local/src/editors/vim $ vi **/CVS(/)/Root(.)
          Invalid regexp: "Unmatched ( or \\("
</pre>

      <p>With <samp><span class="command">zsh</span></samp>, the
      glob above expands to all files named <samp><span class=
      "file">Root</span></samp> in directories named
      <samp><span class="file">CVS</span></samp>.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Typing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">echo ${locate
    locate}/bin&lt;TAB&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; results in a Lisp
    error</dt>

    <dd>Perhaps it should interpolate all permutations, and make
    that the globbing result, since otherwise hitting return here
    will result in &ldquo;(list of filenames)/bin&rdquo;, which is
    never valuable. Thus, one could <samp><span class=
    "command">cat</span></samp> only C backup files by using
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls ${identity
    *.c}~</span></samp>&rsquo;. In that case, having an alias
    command name <samp><span class="command">glob</span></samp> for
    <samp><span class="command">identity</span></samp> would be
    useful.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Once symbolic mode is supported for <samp><span class=
    "command">umask</span></samp>, implement <samp><span class=
    "command">chmod</span></samp> in Lisp<br /></dt>

    <dt>Create <code>eshell-expand-file-name</code></dt>

    <dd>This would use a data table to transform things such as
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~+</span></samp>&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;,
    etc.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Abstract <samp><span class="file">em-smart.el</span></samp>
    into <samp><span class=
    "file">smart-scroll.el</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>It only really needs: to be hooked onto the output filter
    and the pre-command hook, and to have the input-end and
    input-start markers. And to know whether the last output group
    was &ldquo;successful.&rdquo;<br /></dd>

    <dt>Allow for fully persisting the state of Eshell</dt>

    <dd>This would include: variables, history, buffer, input, dir
    stack, etc.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Implement D as an argument predicate</dt>

    <dd>It means that files beginning with a dot should be included
    in the glob match.<br /></dd>

    <dt>A comma in a predicate list should mean OR</dt>

    <dd>At the moment, this is not supported.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Error if a glob doesn't expand due to a predicate</dt>

    <dd>An error should be generated only if
    <code>eshell-error-if-no-glob</code> is
    non-<code>nil</code>.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(+ RET SPC
    TAB</span></samp>&rsquo; does not cause
    <code>indent-according-to-mode</code> to occur<br /></dt>

    <dt>Create <code>eshell-auto-accumulate-list</code></dt>

    <dd>This is a list of commands for which, if the user presses
    <kbd>RET</kbd>, the text is staged as the next Eshell command,
    rather than being sent to the current interactive
    process.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Display file and line number if an error occurs in a
    script<br /></dt>

    <dt><samp><span class="command">wait</span></samp> doesn't work
    with process ids at the moment<br /></dt>

    <dt>Enable the direct-to-process input code in
    <samp><span class="file">em-term.el</span></samp><br /></dt>

    <dt>Problem with repeating &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">echo
    ${find /tmp}</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      With smart display active, if <kbd>RET</kbd> is held down,
      after a while it can't keep up anymore and starts outputting
      blank lines. It only happens if an asynchronous process is
      involved<small class="dots">...</small>

      <p>I think the problem is that <code>eshell-send-input</code>
      is resetting the input target location, so that if the
      asynchronous process is not done by the time the next
      <kbd>RET</kbd> is received, the input processor thinks that
      the input is meant for the process; which, when smart display
      is enabled, will be the text of the last command line! That
      is a bug in itself.</p>

      <p>In holding down <kbd>RET</kbd> while an asynchronous
      process is running, there will be a point in between
      termination of the process, and the running of
      <code>eshell-post-command-hook</code>, which would cause
      <code>eshell-send-input</code> to call
      <code>eshell-copy-old-input</code>, and then process that
      text as a command to be run after the process. Perhaps there
      should be a way of killing pending input between the death of
      the process, and the
      <code>post-command-hook</code>.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Allow for a more aggressive smart display mode</dt>

    <dd>Perhaps toggled by a command, that makes each output block
    a smart display block.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Create more meta variables</dt>

    <dd>
      <dl>
        <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">$!</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>The reason for the failure of the last disk command, or
        the text of the last Lisp error.<br /></dd>

        <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">$=</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

        <dd>A special associate array, which can take references of
        the form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
        "samp">$=[REGEXP]</span></samp>&rsquo;. It indexes into the
        directory ring.</dd>
      </dl><br />
    </dd>

    <dt>Eshell scripts can't execute in the background<br /></dt>

    <dt>Support zsh's &ldquo;Parameter Expansion&rdquo; syntax,
    i.e. &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">${</span><var>name</var><span class=
    "samp">:-</span><var>val</var><span class=
    "samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;<br /></dt>

    <dt>Write an <samp><span class="command">info</span></samp>
    alias that can take arguments</dt>

    <dd>So that the user can enter &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">info chmod</span></samp>&rsquo;, for example.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Create a mode <code>eshell-browse</code></dt>

    <dd>It would treat the Eshell buffer as a outline. Collapsing
    the outline hides all of the output text. Collapsing again
    would show only the first command run in each
    directory<br /></dd>

    <dt>Allow other revisions of a file to be referenced using
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">file{rev}</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>This would be expanded by
    <code>eshell-expand-file-name</code> (see above).<br /></dd>

    <dt>Print &ldquo;You have new mail&rdquo; when the
    &ldquo;Mail&rdquo; icon is turned on<br /></dt>

    <dt>Implement <kbd>M-|</kbd> for Eshell<br /></dt>

    <dt>Implement input redirection</dt>

    <dd>If it's a Lisp function, input redirection implies
    <samp><span class="command">xargs</span></samp> (in a
    way<small class="dots">...</small>). If input redirection is
    added, also update the <code>file-name-quote-list</code>, and
    the delimiter list.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Allow &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">#&lt;</span><var>word</var> <var>arg</var><span class=
    "samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; as a generic syntax</dt>

    <dd>With the handling of <em>word</em> specified by an
    <code>eshell-special-alist</code>.<br /></dd>

    <dt>In <code>eshell-veal-using-options</code>, allow a
    <code>:complete</code> tag</dt>

    <dd>It would be used to provide completion rules for that
    command. Then the macro will automagically define the
    completion function.<br /></dd>

    <dt>For <code>eshell-command-on-region</code>, apply
    redirections to the result</dt>

    <dd>
      So that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+ &gt;
      'blah</span></samp>&rsquo; would cause the result of the
      <code>+</code> (using input from the current region) to be
      inserting into the symbol <code>blah</code>.

      <p>If an external command is being invoked, the input is sent
      as standard input, as if a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">cat &lt;region&gt; |</span></samp>&rsquo; had been
      invoked.</p>

      <p>If a Lisp command, or an alias, is invoked, then if the
      line has no newline characters, it is divided by whitespace
      and passed as arguments to the Lisp function. Otherwise, it
      is divided at the newline characters. Thus, invoking
      <code>+</code> on a series of numbers will add them;
      <code>min</code> would display the smallest figure,
      etc.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Write <code>eshell-script-mode</code> as a minor mode</dt>

    <dd>It would provide syntax, abbrev, highlighting and indenting
    support like <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code> and
    <code>shell-mode</code>.<br /></dd>

    <dt>In the history mechanism, finish the <samp><span class=
    "command">bash</span></samp>-style support</dt>

    <dd>This means &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">!n</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">!#</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">!:%</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">!:1-</span></samp>&rsquo; as separate from
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">!:1*</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Support the -n command line option for <samp><span class=
    "command">history</span></samp><br /></dt>

    <dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">fc</span></samp> in
    Lisp<br /></dt>

    <dt>Specifying a frame as a redirection target should imply the
    currently active window's buffer<br /></dt>

    <dt>Implement &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&gt;</span><var>func-or-func-list</var></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>This would allow for an &ldquo;output translators&rdquo;,
    that take a function to modify output with, and a target.
    Devise a syntax that works well with pipes, and can accommodate
    multiple functions (i.e., &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&gt;'(upcase regexp-quote)</span></samp>&rsquo; or
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&gt;'upcase</span></samp>&rsquo;).<br /></dd>

    <dt>Allow Eshell to read/write to/from standard input and
    output</dt>

    <dd>This would be optional, rather than always using the Eshell
    buffer. This would allow it to be run from the command line
    (perhaps).<br /></dd>

    <dt>Write a <samp><span class="command">help</span></samp>
    command</dt>

    <dd>It would call subcommands with <samp><span class=
    "option">--help</span></samp>, or <samp><span class=
    "option">-h</span></samp> or <samp><span class=
    "option">/?</span></samp>, as appropriate.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">stty</span></samp> in
    Lisp<br /></dt>

    <dt>Support <samp><span class="command">rc</span></samp>'s
    matching operator, e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~
    (</span><var>list</var><span class="samp">)</span>
    <var>regexp</var></samp>&rsquo;<br /></dt>

    <dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">bg</span></samp> and
    <samp><span class="command">fg</span></samp> as editors of
    <code>eshell-process-list</code></dt>

    <dd>Using <samp><span class="command">bg</span></samp> on a
    process that is already in the background does nothing.
    Specifying redirection targets replaces (or adds) to the list
    current being used.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Have <samp><span class="command">jobs</span></samp> print
    only the processes for the current shell<br /></dt>

    <dt>How can Eshell learn if a background process has requested
    input?<br /></dt>

    <dt>Support &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">2&gt;&amp;1</span></samp>&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;
    and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
    and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">|&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>The syntax table for parsing these should be customizable,
    such that the user could change it to use rc syntax:
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&gt;[2=1]</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Allow &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">$_[-1]</span></samp>&rsquo;, which would indicate the
    last element of the array<br /></dt>

    <dt>Make &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">$x[*]</span></samp>&rsquo; equal to listing out the full
    contents of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>Return them as a list, so that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">$_[*]</span></samp>&rsquo; is all the arguments of the
    last command.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Copy ANSI code handling from <samp><span class=
    "file">term.el</span></samp> into <samp><span class=
    "file">em-term.el</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>Make it possible for the user to send char-by-char to the
    underlying process. Ultimately, I should be able to move away
    from using term.el altogether, since everything but the ANSI
    code handling is already part of Eshell. Then, things would
    work correctly on MS-Windows as well (which doesn't have
    <samp><span class="file">/bin/sh</span></samp>, although
    <samp><span class="file">term.el</span></samp> tries to use
    it).<br /></dd>

    <dt>Make the shell spawning commands be visual</dt>

    <dd>That is, make (<samp><span class=
    "command">su</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
    "command">bash</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
    "command">telnet</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
    "command">rlogin</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
    "command">rsh</span></samp>, etc.) be part of
    <code>eshell-visual-commands</code>. The only exception is if
    the shell is being used to invoke a single command. Then, the
    behavior should be based on what that command is.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Create a smart viewing command named <samp><span class=
    "command">open</span></samp></dt>

    <dd>This would search for some way to open its argument
    (similar to opening a file in the Windows Explorer).<br /></dd>

    <dt>Alias <samp><span class="command">read</span></samp> to be
    the same as <samp><span class="command">open</span></samp>,
    only read-only<br /></dt>

    <dt>Write a <samp><span class="command">tail</span></samp>
    command which uses <code>view-file</code></dt>

    <dd>It would move point to the end of the buffer, and then
    turns on auto-revert mode in that buffer at frequent
    intervals&mdash;and a <samp><span class=
    "command">head</span></samp> alias which assumes an upper limit
    of <code>eshell-maximum-line-length</code> characters per
    line.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Make <samp><span class="command">dgrep</span></samp> load
    <code>dired</code>, mark everything, then invoke
    <code>dired-do-search</code><br /></dt>

    <dt>Write mesh.c</dt>

    <dd>This would run Emacs with the appropriate arguments to
    invoke Eshell only. That way, it could be listed as a login
    shell.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Use an intangible <code>PS2</code> string for multi-line
    input prompts<br /></dt>

    <dt>Auto-detect when a command is visual, by checking
    <code>TERMCAP</code> usage<br /></dt>

    <dt>The first keypress after <kbd>M-x watson</kbd> triggers
    `eshell-send-input'<br /></dt>

    <dt>Make <kbd>/</kbd> electric</dt>

    <dd>So that it automatically expands and corrects pathnames. Or
    make pathname completion for Pcomplete auto-expand
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">/u/i/std&lt;TAB&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; to
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">/usr/include/std&lt;TAB&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Write the <samp><span class="command">pushd</span></samp>
    stack to disk along with <code>last-dir-ring</code><br /></dt>

    <dt>Add options to <code>eshell/cat</code> which would allow it
    to sort and uniq<br /></dt>

    <dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">wc</span></samp> in
    Lisp</dt>

    <dd>Add support for counting sentences, paragraphs, pages,
    etc.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Once piping is added, implement <samp><span class=
    "command">sort</span></samp> and <samp><span class=
    "command">uniq</span></samp> in Lisp<br /></dt>

    <dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">touch</span></samp>
    in Lisp<br /></dt>

    <dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">comm</span></samp> in
    Lisp<br /></dt>

    <dt>Implement an <samp><span class=
    "command">epatch</span></samp> command in Lisp</dt>

    <dd>This would call <code>ediff-patch-file</code>, or
    <code>ediff-patch-buffer</code>, depending on its
    argument.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Have an option such that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls
    -l</span></samp>&rsquo; generates a dired buffer<br /></dt>

    <dt>Write a version of <samp><span class=
    "command">xargs</span></samp> based on command rewriting</dt>

    <dd>That is, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">find X | xargs
    Y</span></samp>&rsquo; would be indicated using
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y ${find
    X}</span></samp>&rsquo;. Maybe <code>eshell-do-pipelines</code>
    could be changed to perform this on-thy-fly
    rewriting.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Write an alias for <samp><span class=
    "command">less</span></samp> that brings up a
    <code>view-mode</code> buffer</dt>

    <dd>Such that the user can press &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt;,
    and then &lt;q&gt; to return to Eshell. It would be equivalent
    to: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X &gt; #&lt;buffer Y&gt;;
    view-buffer #&lt;buffer Y&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Make <code>eshell-mode</code> as much a full citizen as
    <code>shell-mode</code></dt>

    <dd>Everywhere in Emacs where <code>shell-mode</code> is
    specially noticed, add <code>eshell-mode</code>
    there.<br /></dd>

    <dt>Permit the umask to be selectively set on a
    <samp><span class="command">cp</span></samp> target<br /></dt>

    <dt>Problem using <kbd>M-x eshell</kbd> after using
    <code>eshell-command</code></dt>

    <dd>If the first thing that I do after entering Emacs is to run
    <code>eshell-command</code> and invoke <samp><span class=
    "command">ls</span></samp>, and then use <kbd>M-x eshell</kbd>,
    it doesn't display anything.<br /></dd>

    <dt><kbd>M-RET</kbd> during a long command (using smart
    display) doesn't work</dt>

    <dd>Since it keeps the cursor up where the command was
    invoked.</dd>
