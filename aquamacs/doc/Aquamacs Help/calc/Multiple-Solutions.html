  <h4 class="subsection">11.6.1 Multiple Solutions</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-H-a-S-1762" id=
  "index-H-a-S-1762"></a><a name="index-fsolve-1763" id=
  "index-fsolve-1763"></a>Some equations have more than one
  solution. The Hyperbolic flag (<code>H a S</code>)
  [<code>fsolve</code>] tells the solver to report the fully
  general family of solutions. It will invent variables
  <code>n1</code>, <code>n2</code>, <small class=
  "dots">...</small>, which represent independent arbitrary
  integers, and <code>s1</code>, <code>s2</code>, <small class=
  "dots">...</small>, which represent independent arbitrary signs
  (either <i>+1</i> or <i>-1</i>). If you don't use the Hyperbolic
  flag, Calc will use zero in place of all arbitrary integers, and
  plus one in place of all arbitrary signs. Note that variables
  like <code>n1</code> and <code>s1</code> are not given any
  special interpretation in Calc except by the equation solver
  itself. As usual, you can use the <kbd>s&nbsp;l</kbd><!-- /@w -->
   (<code>calc-let</code>) command to obtain solutions for various
  actual values of these variables.</p>

  <p>For example, <kbd>' x^2 = y &lt;RET&gt; H a S x
  &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> solves to get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x
  = s1 sqrt(y)</span></samp>&rsquo;, indicating that the two
  solutions to the equation are &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(y)</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-sqrt(y)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Another way to think about
  it is that the square-root operation is really a two-valued
  function; since every Calc function must return a single result,
  <code>sqrt</code> chooses to return the positive result. Then
  <kbd>H a S</kbd> doctors this result using <code>s1</code> to
  indicate the full set of possible values of the mathematical
  square-root.</p>

  <p>There is a similar phenomenon going the other direction:
  Suppose we solve &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(y) =
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; for <code>y</code>. Calc squares both
  sides to get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y =
  x^2</span></samp>&rsquo;. This is correct, except that it
  introduces some dubious solutions. Consider solving
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(y) =
  -3</span></samp>&rsquo;: Calc will report
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y = 9</span></samp>&rsquo; as a
  valid solution, which is true in the mathematical sense of
  square-root, but false (there is no solution) for the actual Calc
  positive-valued <code>sqrt</code>. This happens for both <kbd>a
  S</kbd> and <kbd>H a S</kbd>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bGenCount_007d-variable-1764"
  id=
  "index-g_t_0040code_007bGenCount_007d-variable-1764"></a><a name=
  "index-GenCount-1765" id="index-GenCount-1765"></a><a name=
  "index-an-1766" id="index-an-1766"></a><a name="index-as-1767"
  id="index-as-1767"></a>If you store a positive integer in the
  Calc variable <code>GenCount</code>, then Calc will generate
  formulas of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">as(</span><var>n</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; for arbitrary signs, and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">an(</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  for arbitrary integers, where <var>n</var> represents successive
  values taken by incrementing <code>GenCount</code> by one. While
  the normal arbitrary sign and integer symbols start over at
  <code>s1</code> and <code>n1</code> with each new Calc command,
  the <code>GenCount</code> approach will give each arbitrary value
  a name that is unique throughout the entire Calc session. Also,
  the arbitrary values are function calls instead of variables,
  which is advantageous in some cases. For example, you can make a
  rewrite rule that recognizes all arbitrary signs using a pattern
  like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">as(n)</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  The <kbd>s l</kbd> command only works on variables, but you can
  use the <kbd>a b</kbd> (<code>calc-substitute</code>) command to
  substitute actual values for function calls like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">as(3)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>s G</kbd> (<code>calc-edit-GenCount</code>) command
  is a convenient way to create or edit this variable. Press
  <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to finish.</p>

  <p>If you have not stored a value in <code>GenCount</code>, or if
  the value in that variable is not a positive integer, the regular
  <code>s1</code>/<code>n1</code> notation is used.</p>

  <p><a name="index-I-a-S-1768" id="index-I-a-S-1768"></a><a name=
  "index-H-I-a-S-1769" id="index-H-I-a-S-1769"></a><a name=
  "index-finv-1770" id="index-finv-1770"></a><a name=
  "index-ffinv-1771" id="index-ffinv-1771"></a>With the Inverse
  flag, <kbd>I a S</kbd> [<code>finv</code>] treats the expression
  on top of the stack as a function of the specified variable and
  solves to find the inverse function, written in terms of the same
  variable. For example, <kbd>I a S x</kbd> inverts
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2x + 6</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x/2 - 3</span></samp>&rsquo;. You
  can use both Inverse and Hyperbolic [<code>ffinv</code>] to
  obtain a fully general inverse, as described above.</p>

  "index-calc_002dpoly_002droots-1773" id=
  "index-calc_002dpoly_002droots-1773"></a><a name=
  "index-roots-1774" id="index-roots-1774"></a>Some equations,
  specifically polynomials, have a known, finite number of
  solutions. The <kbd>a P</kbd> (<code>calc-poly-roots</code>)
  [<code>roots</code>] command uses <kbd>H a S</kbd> to solve an
  equation in general form, then, for all arbitrary-sign variables
  like <code>s1</code>, and all arbitrary-integer variables like
  <code>n1</code> for which <code>n1</code> only usefully varies
  over a finite range, it expands these variables out to all their
  possible values. The results are collected into a vector, which
  is returned. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">roots(x^4 = 1, x)</span></samp>&rsquo; returns the four
  solutions &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1, -1, (0, 1), (0,
  -1)]</span></samp>&rsquo;. Generally an <var>n</var>th degree
  polynomial will always have <var>n</var> roots on the complex
  plane. (If you have given a <code>real</code> declaration for the
  solution variable, then only the real-valued solutions, if any,
  will be reported; see <a href=
  "Declarations.html#Declarations">Declarations</a>.)</p>

  <p>Note that because <kbd>a P</kbd> uses <kbd>H a S</kbd>, it is
  able to deliver symbolic solutions if the polynomial has symbolic
  coefficients. Also note that Calc's solver is not able to get
  exact symbolic solutions to all polynomials. Polynomials
  containing powers up to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^4</span></samp>&rsquo; can always be solved exactly;
  polynomials of higher degree sometimes can be:
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^6 + x^3 +
  1</span></samp>&rsquo; is converted to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(x^3)^2 + (x^3) + 1</span></samp>&rsquo;, which can be
  solved for &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^3</span></samp>&rsquo; using the quadratic equation, and
  then for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;
  by taking cube roots. But in many cases, like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^6 + x + 1</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  Calc does not know how to rewrite the polynomial into a form it
  can solve. The <kbd>a P</kbd> command can still deliver a list of
  numerical roots, however, provided that Symbolic mode (<kbd>m
  s</kbd>) is not turned on. (If you work with Symbolic mode on,
  recall that the <kbd>N</kbd> (<code>calc-eval-num</code>) key is
  a handy way to reevaluate the formula on the stack with Symbolic
  mode temporarily off.) Naturally, <kbd>a P</kbd> can only provide
  numerical roots if the polynomial coefficients are all numbers
  (real or complex).</p>
