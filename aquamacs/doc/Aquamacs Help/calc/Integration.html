  <h4 class="subsection">11.5.2 Integration</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-a-i-1742" id=
  "index-a-i-1742"></a><a name="index-calc_002dintegral-1743" id=
  "index-calc_002dintegral-1743"></a><a name="index-integ-1744" id=
  "index-integ-1744"></a>The <kbd>a i</kbd>
  (<code>calc-integral</code>) [<code>integ</code>] command
  computes the indefinite integral of the expression on the top of
  the stack with respect to a prompted-for variable. The integrator
  is not guaranteed to work for all integrable functions, but it is
  able to integrate several large classes of formulas. In
  particular, any polynomial or rational function (a polynomial
  divided by a polynomial) is acceptable. (Rational functions don't
  have to be in explicit quotient form, however;
  <!-- @math{x/(1+x^{-2})} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x/(1+x^-2)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  is not strictly a quotient of polynomials, but it is equivalent
  to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^3/(x^2+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is.) Also, square
  roots of terms involving &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; may appear in rational functions
  being integrated. Finally, rational functions involving
  trigonometric or hyperbolic functions can be integrated.</p>

  <p>With an argument (<kbd>C-u a i</kbd>), this command will
  compute the definite integral of the expression on top of the
  stack. In this case, the command will again prompt for an
  integration variable, then prompt for a lower limit and an upper
  limit.</p>

  <p>If you use the <code>integ</code> function directly in an
  algebraic formula, you can also write &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">integ(f,x,v)</span></samp>&rsquo; which expresses the
  resulting indefinite integral in terms of variable <code>v</code>
  instead of <code>x</code>. With four arguments,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">integ(f(x),x,a,b)</span></samp>&rsquo; represents a
  definite integral from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>.</p>

  <p>Please note that the current implementation of Calc's
  integrator sometimes produces results that are significantly more
  complex than they need to be. For example, the integral Calc
  finds for <!-- @math{1/(x+\sqrt{x^2+1})} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1/(x+sqrt(x^2+1))</span></samp>&rsquo; is several times
  more complicated than the answer Mathematica returns for the same
  input, although the two forms are numerically equivalent. Also,
  any indefinite integral should be considered to have an arbitrary
  constant of integration added to it, although Calc does not write
  an explicit constant of integration in its result. For example,
  Calc's solution for <!-- @math{1/(1+\tan x)} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1/(1+tan(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; differs from the
  solution given in the <em>CRC Math Tables</em> by a constant
  factor of <!-- @math{\pi i / 2} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pi i / 2</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  due to a different choice of constant of integration.</p>

  <p>The Calculator remembers all the integrals it has done. If
  conditions change in a way that would invalidate the old
  integrals, say, a switch from Degrees to Radians mode, then they
  will be thrown out. If you suspect this is not happening when it
  should, use the <code>calc-flush-caches</code> command; see
  <a href="Caches.html#Caches">Caches</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-IntegLimit-1745" id=
  "index-IntegLimit-1745"></a>Calc normally will pursue integration
  by substitution or integration by parts up to 3 nested times
  before abandoning an approach as fruitless. If the integrator is
  taking too long, you can lower this limit by storing a number
  (like 2) in the variable <code>IntegLimit</code>. (The <kbd>s
  I</kbd> command is a convenient way to edit
  <code>IntegLimit</code>.) If this variable has no stored value or
  does not contain a nonnegative integer, a limit of 3 is used. The
  lower this limit is, the greater the chance that Calc will be
  unable to integrate a function it could otherwise handle. Raising
  this limit allows the Calculator to solve more integrals, though
  the time it takes may grow exponentially. You can monitor the
  integrator's actions by creating an Emacs buffer called
  <code>*Trace*</code>. If such a buffer exists, the <kbd>a i</kbd>
  command will write a log of its actions there.</p>

  <p>If you want to manipulate integrals in a purely symbolic way,
  you can set the integration nesting limit to 0 to prevent all but
  fast table-lookup solutions of integrals. You might then wish to
  define rewrite rules for integration by parts, various kinds of
  substitutions, and so on. See <a href=
  "Rewrite-Rules.html#Rewrite-Rules">Rewrite Rules</a>.</p>
