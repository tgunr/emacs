  <h4 class="subsection">11.6.2 Solving Systems of Equations</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name=
  "index-Systems-of-equations_002c-symbolic-1775" id=
  "index-Systems-of-equations_002c-symbolic-1775"></a>You can also
  use the commands described above to solve systems of simultaneous
  equations. Just create a vector of equations, then specify a
  vector of variables for which to solve. (You can omit the
  surrounding brackets when entering the vector of variables at the
  prompt.)</p>

  <p>For example, putting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[x + y =
  a, x - y = b]</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack and typing <kbd>a
  S x,y &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> produces the vector of solutions
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[x = a - (a-b)/2, y =
  (a-b)/2]</span></samp>&rsquo;. The result vector will have the
  same length as the variables vector, and the variables will be
  listed in the same order there. Note that the solutions are not
  always simplified as far as possible; the solution for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; here could
  be improved by an application of the <kbd>a n</kbd> command.</p>

  <p>Calc's algorithm works by trying to eliminate one variable at
  a time by solving one of the equations for that variable and then
  substituting into the other equations. Calc will try all the
  possibilities, but you can speed things up by noting that Calc
  first tries to eliminate the first variable with the first
  equation, then the second variable with the second equation, and
  so on. It also helps to put the simpler (e.g., more linear)
  equations toward the front of the list. Calc's algorithm will
  solve any system of linear equations, and also many kinds of
  nonlinear systems.</p>

  <p><a name="index-elim-1776" id="index-elim-1776"></a>Normally
  there will be as many variables as equations. If you give fewer
  variables than equations (an &ldquo;over-determined&rdquo; system
  of equations), Calc will find a partial solution. For example,
  typing <kbd>a S y &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> with the above system of
  equations would produce &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[y = a -
  x]</span></samp>&rsquo;. There are now several ways to express
  this solution in terms of the original variables; Calc uses the
  first one that it finds. You can control the choice by adding
  variable specifiers of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">elim(</span><var>v</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; to the variables list. This says
  that <var>v</var> should be eliminated from the equations; the
  variable will not appear at all in the solution. For example,
  typing <kbd>a S y,elim(x)</kbd> would yield
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[y = a -
  (b+a)/2]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If the variables list contains only <code>elim</code>
  specifiers, Calc simply eliminates those variables from the
  equations and then returns the resulting set of equations. For
  example, <kbd>a S elim(x)</kbd> produces
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a - 2 y =
  b]</span></samp>&rsquo;. Every variable eliminated will reduce
  the number of equations in the system by one.</p>

  <p>Again, <kbd>a S</kbd> gives you one solution to the system of
  equations. If there are several solutions, you can use <kbd>H a
  S</kbd> to get a general family of solutions, or, if there is a
  finite number of solutions, you can use <kbd>a P</kbd> to get a
  list. (In the latter case, the result will take the form of a
  matrix where the rows are different solutions and the columns
  correspond to the variables you requested.)</p>

  <p>Another way to deal with certain kinds of overdetermined
  systems of equations is the <kbd>a F</kbd> command, which does
  least-squares fitting to satisfy the equations. See <a href=
  "Curve-Fitting.html#Curve-Fitting">Curve Fitting</a>.</p>
