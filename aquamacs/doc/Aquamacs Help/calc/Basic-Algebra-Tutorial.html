  <h4 class="subsection">3.5.1 Basic Algebra</h4>

  <p class="noindent">If you enter a formula in Algebraic mode that
  refers to variables, the formula itself is pushed onto the stack.
  You can manipulate formulas as regular data objects.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2 x^2 - 6       1:  6 - 2 x^2       1:  (6 - 2 x^2) (3 x^2 + y)
         .                   .                   .

         ' 2x^2-6 &lt;RET&gt;        n                   ' 3x^2+y &lt;RET&gt; *
</pre>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Do <kbd>' x &lt;RET&gt;
  Q 2 ^</kbd> and <kbd>' x &lt;RET&gt; 2 ^ Q</kbd> both wind up
  with the same result (&lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;)? Why or why not? See <a href=
  "Algebra-Answer-1.html#Algebra-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>There are also commands for doing common algebraic operations
  on formulas. Continuing with the formula from the last
  example,</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  18 x^2 + 6 y - 6 x^4 - 2 x^2 y    1:  (18 - 2 y) x^2 - 6 x^4 + 6 y
         .                                     .

         a x                                   a c x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">First we &ldquo;expand&rdquo; using the
  distributive law, then we &ldquo;collect&rdquo; terms involving
  like powers of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Let's find the value of this expression when
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is 2 and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  one-half.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3      1:  -25
         .                           .

         1:2 s l y &lt;RET&gt;               2 s l x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The <kbd>s l</kbd> command means
  &ldquo;let&rdquo;; it takes a number from the top of the stack
  and temporarily assigns it as the value of the variable you
  specify. It then evaluates (as if by the <kbd>=</kbd> key) the
  next expression on the stack. After this command, the variable
  goes back to its original value, if any.</p>

  <p>(An earlier exercise in this tutorial involved storing a value
  in the variable <code>x</code>; if this value is still there, you
  will have to unstore it with <kbd>s u x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> before
  the above example will work properly.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-Maximum-of-a-function-using-Calculus-63" id=
  "index-Maximum-of-a-function-using-Calculus-63"></a>Let's find
  the maximum value of our original expression when
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  one-half and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; ranges over all possible values. We
  can do this by taking the derivative with respect to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  examining values of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; for which the derivative is zero.
  If the second derivative of the function at that value of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  negative, the function has a local maximum there.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3      1:  34 x - 24 x^3
         .                           .

         U &lt;DEL&gt;  s 1                  a d x &lt;RET&gt;   s 2
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Well, the derivative is clearly zero when
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is zero.
  To find the other root(s), let's divide through by
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and then
  solve:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  (34 x - 24 x^3) / x    1:  34 x / x - 24 x^3 / x    1:  34 - 24 x^2
         .                          .                            .

         ' x &lt;RET&gt; /                  a x                          a s
</pre>

  <p class="noindent"></p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  34 - 24 x^2 = 0        1:  x = 1.19023
         .                          .

         0 a =  s 3                 a S x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Notice the use of <kbd>a s</kbd> to
  &ldquo;simplify&rdquo; the formula. When the default algebraic
  simplifications don't do enough, you can use <kbd>a s</kbd> to
  tell Calc to spend more time on the job.</p>

  <p>Now we compute the second derivative and plug in our values of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  1.19023        2:  1.19023         2:  1.19023
         .              1:  34 x - 24 x^3   1:  34 - 72 x^2
                            .                   .

         a .                r 2                 a d x &lt;RET&gt; s 4
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(The <kbd>a .</kbd> command extracts just the
  righthand side of an equation. Another method would have been to
  use <kbd>v u</kbd> to unpack the equation
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.19</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.19</span></samp>&rsquo;, then
  use <kbd>M-- M-2 &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> to delete the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.)</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  34 - 72 x^2   1:  -68.         2:  34 - 72 x^2     1:  34
     1:  1.19023           .            1:  0                   .
         .                                  .

         &lt;TAB&gt;               s l x &lt;RET&gt;        U &lt;DEL&gt; 0             s l x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The first of these second derivatives is
  negative, so we know the function has a maximum value at
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x = 1.19023</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  (The function also has a local <em>minimum</em> at
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x = 0</span></samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  <p>When we solved for &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, we got only one value even though
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">34 - 24 x^2 =
  0</span></samp>&rsquo; is a quadratic equation that ought to have
  two solutions. The reason is that <kbd>a&nbsp;S</kbd><!-- /@w -->
   normally returns a single &ldquo;principal&rdquo; solution. If
  it needs to come up with an arbitrary sign (as occurs in the
  quadratic formula) it picks &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;. If it needs an arbitrary integer,
  it picks zero. We can get a full solution by pressing
  <kbd>H</kbd> (the Hyperbolic flag) before <kbd>a S</kbd>.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  34 - 24 x^2 = 0    1:  x = 1.19023 s1      1:  x = -1.19023
         .                      .                       .

         r 3                    H a S x &lt;RET&gt;  s 5        1 n  s l s1 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Calc has invented the variable
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s1</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  represent an unknown sign; it is supposed to be either <i>+1</i>
  or <i>-1</i>. Here we have used the &ldquo;let&rdquo; command to
  evaluate the expression when the sign is negative. If we plugged
  this into our second derivative we would get the same, negative,
  answer, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x =
  -1.19023</span></samp>&rsquo; is also a maximum.</p>

  <p>To find the actual maximum value, we must plug our two values
  of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; into
  the original formula.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3    1:  24.08333 s1^2 - 12.04166 s1^4 + 3
     1:  x = 1.19023 s1            .
         .

         r 1 r 5                   s l &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(Here we see another way to use <kbd>s
  l</kbd>; if its input is an equation with a variable on the
  lefthand side, then <kbd>s l</kbd> treats the equation like an
  assignment to that variable if you don't give a variable
  name.)</p>

  <p>It's clear that this will have the same value for either sign
  of <code>s1</code>, but let's work it out anyway, just for the
  exercise:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  [-1, 1]              1:  [15.04166, 15.04166]
     1:  24.08333 s1^2 ...        .
         .

       [ 1 n , 1 ] &lt;TAB&gt;            V M $ &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Here we have used a vector mapping operation
  to evaluate the function at several values of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s1</span></samp>&rsquo; at once.
  <kbd>V M $</kbd> is like <kbd>V M '</kbd> except that it takes
  the formula from the top of the stack. The formula is interpreted
  as a function to apply across the vector at the next-to-top stack
  level. Since a formula on the stack can't contain
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; signs,
  Calc assumes the variables in the formula stand for different
  arguments. It prompts you for an <dfn>argument list</dfn>, giving
  the list of all variables in the formula in alphabetical order as
  the default list. In this case the default is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(s1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
  is just what we want so we simply press &lt;RET&gt; at the
  prompt.</p>

  <p>If there had been several different values, we could have used
  <kbd>V&nbsp;R&nbsp;X</kbd><!-- /@w --> to find the global
  maximum.</p>

  <p>Calc has a built-in <kbd>a P</kbd> command that solves an
  equation using <kbd>H&nbsp;a&nbsp;S</kbd><!-- /@w --> and returns
  a vector of all the solutions. It simply automates the job we
  just did by hand. Applied to our original cubic polynomial, it
  would produce the vector of solutions &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[1.19023, -1.19023, 0]</span></samp>&rsquo;. (There is
  also an <kbd>a X</kbd> command which finds a local maximum of a
  function. It uses a numerical search method rather than examining
  the derivatives, and thus requires you to provide some kind of
  initial guess to show it where to look.)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Given a vector of the
  roots of a polynomial (such as the output of an <kbd>a P</kbd>
  command), what sequence of commands would you use to reconstruct
  the original polynomial? (The answer will be unique to within a
  constant multiple; choose the solution where the leading
  coefficient is one.) See <a href=
  "Algebra-Answer-2.html#Algebra-Answer-2">2</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>The <kbd>m s</kbd> command enables Symbolic mode, in which
  formulas like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(5)</span></samp>&rsquo; that can't be evaluated
  exactly are left in symbolic form rather than giving a
  floating-point approximate answer. Fraction mode (<kbd>m f</kbd>)
  is also useful when doing algebra.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  34 x - 24 x^3        2:  34 x - 24 x^3
     1:  34 x - 24 x^3        1:  [sqrt(51) / 6, sqrt(51) / -6, 0]
         .                        .

         r 2  &lt;RET&gt;     m s  m f    a P x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p>One more mode that makes reading formulas easier is Big
  mode.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
                    3
     2:  34 x - 24 x

           ____   ____

         .

         d B
</pre>

  <p>Here things like powers, square roots, and quotients and
  fractions are displayed in a two-dimensional pictorial form. Calc
  has other language modes as well, such as C mode, FORTRAN mode,
  TeX mode and LaTeX mode.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  34*x - 24*pow(x, 3)               2:  34*x - 24*x**3
     1:  {sqrt(51) / 6, sqrt(51) / -6, 0}  1:  /sqrt(51) / 6, sqrt(51) / -6, 0/
         .                                     .

         d C                                   d F
</pre>

  <p class="noindent"></p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     3:  34 x - 24 x^3
     2:  [{\sqrt{51} \over 6}, {\sqrt{51} \over -6}, 0]
     1:  {2 \over 3} \sqrt{5}
         .

         d T   ' 2 \sqrt{5} \over 3 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">As you can see, language modes affect both
  entry and display of formulas. They affect such things as the
  names used for built-in functions, the set of arithmetic
  operators and their precedences, and notations for vectors and
  matrices.</p>

  <p>Notice that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(51)</span></samp>&rsquo; may cause problems with
  older implementations of C and FORTRAN, which would require
  something more like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(51.0)</span></samp>&rsquo;. It is always wise to
  check over the formulas produced by the various language modes to
  make sure they are fully correct.</p>

  <p>Type <kbd>m s</kbd>, <kbd>m f</kbd>, and <kbd>d N</kbd> to
  reset these modes. (You may prefer to remain in Big mode, but all
  the examples in the tutorial are shown in normal mode.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-Area-under-a-curve-64" id=
  "index-Area-under-a-curve-64"></a>What is the area under the
  portion of this curve from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x =
  1</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo;? This is simply the integral of the
  function:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3     1:  5.6666 x^3 - 1.2 x^5 + 3 x
         .                          .

         r 1                        a i x
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">We want to evaluate this at our two values
  for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  subtract. One way to do it is again with vector mapping and
  reduction:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  [2, 1]            1:  [12.93333, 7.46666]    1:  5.46666
     1:  5.6666 x^3 ...        .                          .

        [ 2 , 1 ] &lt;TAB&gt;          V M $ &lt;RET&gt;                  V R -
</pre>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Find the integral from 1
  to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; of
  <!-- @math{x \sin \pi x} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x&nbsp;sin(pi&nbsp;x)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
   (where the sine is calculated in radians). Find the values of
  the integral for integers &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; from 1 to 5. See <a href=
  "Algebra-Answer-3.html#Algebra-Answer-3">3</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>Calc's integrator can do many simple integrals symbolically,
  but many others are beyond its capabilities. Suppose we wish to
  find the area under the curve <!-- @math{\sin x \ln x} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x)
  ln(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; over the same range of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. If you
  entered this formula and typed <kbd>a i x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
  (don't bother to try this), Calc would work for a long time but
  would be unable to find a solution. In fact, there is no
  closed-form solution to this integral. Now what do we do?</p>

  <p><a name="index-Integration_002c-numerical-65" id=
  "index-Integration_002c-numerical-65"></a><a name=
  "index-Numerical-integration-66" id=
  "index-Numerical-integration-66"></a>One approach would be to do
  the integral numerically. It is not hard to do this by hand using
  vector mapping and reduction. It is rather slow, though, since
  the sine and logarithm functions take a long time. We can save
  some time by reducing the working precision.</p>

  <p>Here we have divided the curve into ten segments of equal
  width; approximating these segments as rectangular boxes (i.e.,
  assuming the curve is nearly flat at that resolution), we compute
  the areas of the boxes (height times width), then sum the areas.
  (It is faster to sum first, then multiply by the width, since the
  width is the same for every box.)</p>

  <p>The true value of this integral turns out to be about 0.374,
  so we're not doing too well. Let's try another approach.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">

  <p class="noindent">Here we have computed the Taylor series
  expansion of the function about the point
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x=1</span></samp>&rsquo;. We can
  now integrate this polynomial approximation, since polynomials
  are easy to integrate.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">

  <p class="noindent">Better! By increasing the precision and/or
  asking for more terms in the Taylor series, we can get a result
  as accurate as we like. (Taylor series converge better away from
  singularities in the function such as the one at
  <code>ln(0)</code>, so it would also help to expand the series
  about the points &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x=2</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x=1.5</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of

  <strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Our first method approximated the
  curve by stairsteps of width 0.1; the total area was then the sum
  of the areas of the rectangles under these stairsteps. Our second
  method approximated the function by a polynomial, which turned
  out to be a better approximation than stairsteps. A third method
  is <dfn>Simpson's rule</dfn>, which is like the stairstep method
  except that the steps are not required to be flat. Simpson's rule
  boils down to the formula,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (h/3) * (f(a) + 4 f(a+h) + 2 f(a+2h) + 4 f(a+3h) + ...
                   + 2 f(a+(n-2)*h) + 4 f(a+(n-1)*h) + f(a+n*h))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">where &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; (which must be even) is the number
  of slices and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo; is the width of each slice. These
  are 10 and 0.1 in our example. For reference, here is the
  corresponding formula for the stairstep method:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     h * (f(a) + f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + f(a+3h) + ...
               + f(a+(n-2)*h) + f(a+(n-1)*h))
</pre>

  <p>Compute the integral from 1 to 2 of
  <!-- @math{\sin x \ln x} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x)
  ln(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; using Simpson's rule with 10 slices.

  <p>Calc has a built-in <kbd>a I</kbd> command for doing numerical
  integration. It uses <dfn>Romberg's method</dfn>, which is a more
  sophisticated cousin of Simpson's rule. In particular, it knows
  how to keep refining the result until the current precision is
  satisfied. <!-- [fix-ref Selecting Sub-Formulas] --></p>

  <p>Aside from the commands we've seen so far, Calc also provides
  a large set of commands for operating on parts of formulas. You
  indicate the desired sub-formula by placing the cursor on any
  part of the formula before giving a <dfn>selection</dfn> command.
  Selections won't be covered in the tutorial; see <a href=
