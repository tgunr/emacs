  <h5 class="subsubsection">7.7.7.2 Free-Form Dates</h5>

  <p class="noindent">When reading a date form during algebraic
  entry, Calc falls back on the algorithm described here if the
  input does not exactly match the current date format. This
  algorithm generally &ldquo;does the right thing&rdquo; and you
  don't have to worry about it, but it is described here in full
  detail for the curious.</p>

  <p>Calc does not distinguish between upper- and lower-case
  letters while interpreting dates.</p>

  <p>First, the time portion, if present, is located somewhere in
  the text and then removed. The remaining text is then interpreted
  as the date.</p>

  <p>A time is of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">hh:mm:ss</span></samp>&rsquo;, possibly with the seconds
  part omitted and possibly with an AM/PM indicator added to
  indicate 12-hour time. If the AM/PM is present, the minutes may
  also be omitted. The AM/PM part may be any of the words
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">am</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pm</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">noon</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">midnight</span></samp>&rsquo;;
  each of these may be abbreviated to one letter, and the alternate
  forms &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a.m.</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p.m.</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mid</span></samp>&rsquo; are also
  understood. Obviously &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">noon</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">midnight</span></samp>&rsquo; are allowed only on
  12:00:00. The words &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">noon</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">mid</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">midnight</span></samp>&rsquo; are also recognized with no
  number attached.</p>

  <p>If there is no AM/PM indicator, the time is interpreted in
  24-hour format.</p>

  <p>To read the date portion, all words and numbers are isolated
  from the string; other characters are ignored. All words must be
  either month names or day-of-week names (the latter of which are
  ignored). Names can be written in full or as three-letter
  abbreviations.</p>

  <p>Large numbers, or numbers with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; signs, are interpreted as years. If
  one of the other numbers is greater than 12, then that must be
  the day and the remaining number in the input is therefore the
  month. Otherwise, Calc assumes the month, day and year are in the
  same order that they appear in the current date format. If the
  year is omitted, the current year is taken from the system
  clock.</p>

  <p>If there are too many or too few numbers, or any
  unrecognizable words, then the input is rejected.</p>

  <p>If there are any large numbers (of five digits or more) other
  than the year, they are ignored on the assumption that they are
  something like Julian dates that were included along with the
  traditional date components when the date was formatted.</p>

  <p>One of the words &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">ad</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a.d.</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">bc</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">b.c.</span></samp>&rsquo; may optionally be used; the
  latter two are equivalent to a minus sign on the year value.</p>

  <p>If you always enter a four-digit year, and use a name instead
  of a number for the month, there is no danger of ambiguity.</p>
