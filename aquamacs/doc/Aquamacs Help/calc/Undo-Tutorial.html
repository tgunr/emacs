  <h4 class="subsection">3.1.3 Undo and Redo</h4>

  <p class="noindent">If you make a mistake, you can usually
  correct it by pressing shift-<kbd>U</kbd>, the &ldquo;undo&rdquo;
  command. First, clear the stack (<kbd>M-0 &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>) and
  exit and restart Calc (<kbd>C-x * * C-x * *</kbd>) to make sure
  things start off with a clean slate. Now:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2          2:  2          1:  8          2:  2          1:  6
         .          1:  3              .          1:  3              .
                        .                             .

        2 &lt;RET&gt;           3              ^              U              *
</pre>

  <p>You can undo any number of times. Calc keeps a complete record
  of all you have done since you last opened the Calc window. After
  the above example, you could type:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  6          2:  2          1:  2              .              .
         .          1:  3              .
                        .
                                                                  (error)
                        U              U              U              U
</pre>

  <p>You can also type <kbd>D</kbd> to &ldquo;redo&rdquo; a command
  that you have undone mistakenly.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
         .          1:  2          2:  2          1:  6          1:  6
                        .          1:  3              .              .
                                       .
                                                                  (error)
                        D              D              D              D
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">It was not possible to redo past the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">6</span></samp>&rsquo;, since
  that was placed there by something other than an undo
  command.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Time-travel-17" id=
  "index-Time-travel-17"></a>You can think of undo and redo as a
  sort of &ldquo;time machine.&rdquo; Press <kbd>U</kbd> to go
  backward in time, <kbd>D</kbd> to go forward. If you go backward
  and do something (like <kbd>*</kbd>) then, as any science fiction
  reader knows, you have changed your future and you cannot go
  forward again. Thus, the inability to redo past the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">6</span></samp>&rsquo; even
  though there was an earlier undo command.</p>

  <p>You can always recall an earlier result using the Trail. We've
  ignored the trail so far, but it has been faithfully recording
  everything we did since we loaded the Calculator. If the Trail is
  not displayed, press <kbd>t d</kbd> now to turn it on.</p>

  <p>Let's try grabbing an earlier result. The
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8</span></samp>&rsquo; we
  computed was undone by a <kbd>U</kbd> command, and was lost even
  to Redo when we pressed <kbd>*</kbd>, but it's still there in the
  trail. There should be a little &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; arrow (the <dfn>trail
  pointer</dfn>) resting on the last trail entry. If there isn't,
  press <kbd>t ]</kbd> to reset the trail pointer. Now, press
  <kbd>t&nbsp;p</kbd><!-- /@w --> to move the arrow onto the line
  containing &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">8</span></samp>&rsquo;, and press <kbd>t&nbsp;y</kbd>
  <!-- /@w --> to &ldquo;yank&rdquo; that number back onto the
  stack.</p>

  <p>If you press <kbd>t ]</kbd> again, you will see that even our
  Yank command went into the trail.</p>

  <p>Let's go further back in time. Earlier in the tutorial we
  computed a huge integer using the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2^3^4</span></samp>&rsquo;. We
  don't remember what it was, but the first digits were
  &ldquo;241&rdquo;. Press <kbd>t r</kbd> (which stands for
  trail-search-reverse), then type <kbd>241</kbd>. The trail cursor
  will jump back to the next previous occurrence of the string
  &ldquo;241&rdquo; in the trail. This is just a regular Emacs
  incremental search; you can now press <kbd>C-s</kbd> or
  <kbd>C-r</kbd> to continue the search forwards or backwards as
  you like.</p>

  <p>To finish the search, press &lt;RET&gt;. This halts the
  incremental search and leaves the trail pointer at the thing we
  found. Now we can type <kbd>t y</kbd> to yank that number onto
  the stack. If we hadn't remembered the &ldquo;241&rdquo;, we
  could simply have searched for <kbd>2^3^4</kbd>, then pressed
  <kbd>&lt;RET&gt; t n</kbd> to halt and then move to the next
  item.</p>

  <p>You may have noticed that all the trail-related commands begin
  with the letter <kbd>t</kbd>. (The store-and-recall commands, on
  the other hand, all began with <kbd>s</kbd>.) Calc has so many
  commands that there aren't enough keys for all of them, so
  various commands are grouped into two-letter sequences where the
  first letter is called the <dfn>prefix</dfn> key. If you type a
  prefix key by accident, you can press <kbd>C-g</kbd> to cancel
  it. (In fact, you can press <kbd>C-g</kbd> to cancel almost
  anything in Emacs.) To get help on a prefix key, press that key
  followed by <kbd>?</kbd>. Some prefixes have several lines of
  help, so you need to press <kbd>?</kbd> repeatedly to see them
  all. You can also type <kbd>h h</kbd> to see all the help at
  once.</p>

  <p>Try pressing <kbd>t ?</kbd> now. You will see a line of the
  form,</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     trail/time: Display; Fwd, Back; Next, Prev, Here, [, ]; Yank:  [MORE]  t-
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The word &ldquo;trail&rdquo; indicates that
  the <kbd>t</kbd> prefix key contains trail-related commands. Each
  entry on the line shows one command, with a single capital letter
  showing which letter you press to get that command. We have used
  <kbd>t n</kbd>, <kbd>t p</kbd>, <kbd>t ]</kbd>, and <kbd>t
  y</kbd> so far. The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[MORE]</span></samp>&rsquo; means you can press
  <kbd>?</kbd> again to see more <kbd>t</kbd>-prefix commands.
  Notice that the commands are roughly divided (by semicolons) into
  related groups.</p>

  <p>When you are in the help display for a prefix key, the prefix
  is still active. If you press another key, like <kbd>y</kbd> for
  example, it will be interpreted as a <kbd>t y</kbd> command. If
  all you wanted was to look at the help messages, press
  <kbd>C-g</kbd> afterwards to cancel the prefix.</p>

  <p>One more way to correct an error is by editing the stack
  entries. The actual Stack buffer is marked read-only and must not
  be edited directly, but you can press <kbd>`</kbd> (the backquote
  or accent grave) to edit a stack entry.</p>

  <p>Try entering &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">3.141439</span></samp>&rsquo; now. If this is supposed to
  represent &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">pi</span></samp>&rsquo;, it's got several errors. Press
  <kbd>`</kbd> to edit this number. Now use the normal Emacs cursor
  motion and editing keys to change the second 4 to a 5, and to
  transpose the 3 and the 9. When you press &lt;RET&gt;, the number
  on the stack will be replaced by your new number. This works for
  formulas, vectors, and all other types of values you can put on
  the stack. The <kbd>`</kbd> key also works during entry of a
  number or algebraic formula.</p>
