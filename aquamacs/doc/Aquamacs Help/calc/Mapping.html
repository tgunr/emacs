  <h4 class="subsection">10.8.2 Mapping</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-v-M-1506" id=
  "index-v-M-1506"></a><a name="index-V-M-1507" id=
  "index-V-M-1507"></a><a name="index-calc_002dmap-1508" id=
  "index-calc_002dmap-1508"></a><a name="index-map-1509" id=
  "index-map-1509"></a>The <kbd>V M</kbd> (<code>calc-map</code>)
  [<code>map</code>] command applies a given operator elementwise
  to one or more vectors. For example, mapping <code>A</code>
  [<code>abs</code>] produces a vector of the absolute values of
  the elements in the input vector. Mapping <code>+</code> pops two
  vectors from the stack, which must be of equal length, and
  produces a vector of the pairwise sums of the elements. If either
  argument is a non-vector, it is duplicated for each element of
  the other vector. For example, <kbd>[1,2,3] 2 V M ^</kbd> squares
  the elements of the specified vector. With the 2 listed first, it
  would have computed a vector of powers of two. Mapping a
  user-defined function pops as many arguments from the stack as
  the function requires. If you give an undefined name, you will be
  prompted for the number of arguments to use.</p>

  <p>If any argument to <kbd>V M</kbd> is a matrix, the operator is
  normally mapped across all elements of the matrix. For example,
  given the matrix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[1, -2, 3],
  [-4, 5, -6]]</span></samp>&rsquo;, <kbd>V M A</kbd> takes six
  absolute values to produce another <!-- @math{3\times2} -->
   3x2 matrix, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5,
  6]]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><a name="index-mapr-1510" id="index-mapr-1510"></a>The command
  <kbd>V M _</kbd> [<code>mapr</code>] (i.e., type an underscore at
  the operator prompt) maps by rows instead. For example, <kbd>V M
  _ A</kbd> views the above matrix as a vector of two 3-element row
  vectors. It produces a new vector which contains the absolute
  values of those row vectors, namely &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[3.74, 8.77]</span></samp>&rsquo;. (Recall, the absolute
  value of a vector is defined as the square root of the sum of the
  squares of the elements.) Some operators accept vectors and
  return new vectors; for example, <kbd>v v</kbd> reverses a
  vector, so <kbd>V M _ v v</kbd> would reverse each row of the
  matrix to get a new matrix, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[3,
  -2, 1], [-6, 5, -4]]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Sometimes a vector of vectors (representing, say, strings,
  sets, or lists) happens to look like a matrix. If so, remember to
  use <kbd>V M _</kbd> if you want to map a function across the
  whole strings or sets rather than across their individual
  elements.</p>

  <p><a name="index-mapc-1511" id="index-mapc-1511"></a>The command
  <kbd>V M :</kbd> [<code>mapc</code>] maps by columns. Basically,
  it transposes the input matrix, maps by rows, and then, if the
  result is a matrix, transposes again. For example, <kbd>V M :
  A</kbd> takes the absolute values of the three columns of the
  matrix, treating each as a 2-vector, and <kbd>V M : v v</kbd>
  reverses the columns to get the matrix &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[[-4, 5, -6], [1, -2, 3]]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>(The symbols <kbd>_</kbd> and <kbd>:</kbd> were chosen because
  they had row-like and column-like appearances, and were not
  already taken by useful operators. Also, they appear shifted on
  most keyboards so they are easy to type after <kbd>V
  M</kbd>.)</p>

  <p>The <kbd>_</kbd> and <kbd>:</kbd> modifiers have no effect on
  arguments that are not matrices (so if none of the arguments are
  matrices, they have no effect at all). If some of the arguments
  are matrices and others are plain numbers, the plain numbers are
  held constant for all rows of the matrix (so that <kbd>2 V M _
  ^</kbd> squares every row of a matrix; squaring a vector takes a
  dot product of the vector with itself).</p>

  <p>If some of the arguments are vectors with the same lengths as
  the rows (for <kbd>V M _</kbd>) or columns (for <kbd>V M :</kbd>)
  of the matrix arguments, those vectors are also held constant for
  every row or column.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it is useful to specify another mapping command as
  the operator to use with <kbd>V M</kbd>. For example, <kbd>V M _
  V A +</kbd> applies <kbd>V A +</kbd> to each row of the input
  matrix, which in turn adds the two values on that row. If you
  give another vector-operator command as the operator for <kbd>V
  M</kbd>, it automatically uses map-by-rows mode if you don't
  specify otherwise; thus <kbd>V M V A +</kbd> is equivalent to
  <kbd>V M _ V A +</kbd>. (If you really want to map-by-elements
  another mapping command, you can use a triple-nested mapping
  command: <kbd>V M V M V A +</kbd> means to map <kbd>V M V A
  +</kbd> over the rows of the matrix; in turn, <kbd>V A +</kbd> is
  mapped over the elements of each row.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-mapa-1512" id="index-mapa-1512"></a><a name=
  "index-mapd-1513" id="index-mapd-1513"></a>Previous versions of
  Calc had &ldquo;map across&rdquo; and &ldquo;map down&rdquo;
  modes that are now considered obsolete; the old &ldquo;map
  across&rdquo; is now simply <kbd>V M V A</kbd>, and &ldquo;map
  down&rdquo; is now <kbd>V M : V A</kbd>. The algebraic functions
  <code>mapa</code> and <code>mapd</code> are still supported,
  though. Note also that, while the old mapping modes were
  persistent (once you set the mode, it would apply to later
  mapping commands until you reset it), the new <kbd>:</kbd> and
  <kbd>_</kbd> modifiers apply only to the current mapping command.
  The default <kbd>V M</kbd> always means map-by-elements.</p>

  <p>See <a href=
  "Algebraic-Manipulation.html#Algebraic-Manipulation">Algebraic
  Manipulation</a>, for the <kbd>a M</kbd> command, which is like
  <kbd>V M</kbd> but for equations and inequalities instead of
  vectors. See <a href=
  "Storing-Variables.html#Storing-Variables">Storing Variables</a>,
  for the <kbd>s m</kbd> command which modifies a variable's stored
  value using a <kbd>V M</kbd>-like operator.</p>
