  <h3 class="section">2.1 What is Calc?</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><dfn>Calc</dfn> is an advanced calculator and
  mathematical tool that runs as part of the GNU Emacs environment.
  Very roughly based on the HP-28/48 series of calculators, its
  many features include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry of
    calculations.</li>

    <li>Arbitrary precision integers and floating-point
    numbers.</li>

    <li>Arithmetic on rational numbers, complex numbers
    (rectangular and polar), error forms with standard deviations,
    open and closed intervals, vectors and matrices, dates and
    times, infinities, sets, quantities with units, and algebraic
    formulas.</li>

    <li>Mathematical operations such as logarithms and
    trigonometric functions.</li>

    <li>Programmer's features (bitwise operations, non-decimal
    numbers).</li>

    <li>Financial functions such as future value and internal rate
    of return.</li>

    <li>Number theoretical features such as prime factorization and
    arithmetic modulo <var>m</var> for any <var>m</var>.</li>

    <li>Algebraic manipulation features, including symbolic
    calculus.</li>

    <li>Moving data to and from regular editing buffers.</li>

    <li>Embedded mode for manipulating Calc formulas and data
    directly inside any editing buffer.</li>

    <li>Graphics using GNUPLOT, a versatile (and free) plotting
    program.</li>

    <li>Easy programming using keyboard macros, algebraic formulas,
    algebraic rewrite rules, or extended Emacs Lisp.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Calc tries to include a little something for everyone; as a
  result it is large and might be intimidating to the first-time
  user. If you plan to use Calc only as a traditional desk
  calculator, all you really need to read is the &ldquo;Getting
  Started&rdquo; chapter of this manual and possibly the first few
  sections of the tutorial. As you become more comfortable with the
  program you can learn its additional features. Calc does not have
  the scope and depth of a fully-functional symbolic math package,
  but Calc has the advantages of convenience, portability, and
  freedom.</p>
