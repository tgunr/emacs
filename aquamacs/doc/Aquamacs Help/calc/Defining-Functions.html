  <h4 class="subsection">18.5.1 Defining New Functions</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-defmath-2322" id=
  "index-defmath-2322"></a>The <code>defmath</code> function
  (actually a Lisp macro) is like <code>defun</code> except that
  code in the body of the definition can make use of the full range
  of Calculator data types. The prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">calcFunc-</span></samp>&rsquo; is added to the specified
  name to get the actual Lisp function name. As a simple
  example,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (defmath myfact (n)
       (if (&gt; n 0)
           (* n (myfact (1- n)))
         1))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">This actually expands to the code,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (defun calcFunc-myfact (n)
       (if (math-posp n)
           (math-mul n (calcFunc-myfact (math-add n -1)))
         1))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">This function can be used in algebraic
  expressions, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">myfact(5)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">myfact</span></samp>&rsquo; function as it is defined
  above has the bug that an expression &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">myfact(a+b)</span></samp>&rsquo; will be simplified to 1
  because the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a+b</span></samp>&rsquo; is not considered to be
  <code>posp</code>. A robust factorial function would be written
  along the following lines:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     (defmath myfact (n)
       (if (&gt; n 0)
           (* n (myfact (1- n)))
         (if (= n 0)
             1
           nil)))    ; this could be simplified as: (and (= n 0) 1)
</pre>

  <p>If a function returns <code>nil</code>, it is left
  unsimplified by the Calculator (except that its arguments will be
  simplified). Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">myfact(a+1+2)</span></samp>&rsquo; will be simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfact(a+3)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  but no further. Beware that every time the Calculator reexamines
  this formula it will attempt to resimplify it, so your function
  ought to detect the returning-<code>nil</code> case as
  efficiently as possible.</p>

  <p>The following standard Lisp functions are treated by
  <code>defmath</code>: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>,
  <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>^</code> or
  <code>expt</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>,
  <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>,
  <code>/=</code>, <code>1+</code>, <code>1-</code>,
  <code>logand</code>, <code>logior</code>, <code>logxor</code>,
  <code>logandc2</code>, <code>lognot</code>. Also, <code>~=</code>
  is an abbreviation for <code>math-nearly-equal</code>, which is
  useful in implementing Taylor series.</p>

  <p>For other functions <var>func</var>, if a function by the name
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">calcFunc-</span><var>func</var></samp>&rsquo; exists it is
  used, otherwise if a function by the name
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">math-</span><var>func</var></samp>&rsquo; exists it is
  used, otherwise if <var>func</var> itself is defined as a
  function it is used, otherwise &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">calcFunc-</span><var>func</var></samp>&rsquo; is used on
  the assumption that this is a to-be-defined math function. Also,
  if the function name is quoted as in &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">('integerp a)</span></samp>&rsquo; the function name is
  always used exactly as written (but not quoted).</p>

  <p>Variable names have &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">var-</span></samp>&rsquo; prepended to them unless they
  appear in the function's argument list or in an enclosing
  <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>, <code>for</code>, or
  <code>foreach</code> form, or their names already contain a
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; character.
  Thus a reference to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; is the same as a reference to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">var-foo</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>A few other Lisp extensions are available in
  <code>defmath</code> definitions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <code>elt</code> function accepts any number of index
    variables. Note that Calc vectors are stored as Lisp lists
    whose first element is the symbol <code>vec</code>; thus,
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(elt v 2)</span></samp>&rsquo;
    yields the second element of vector <code>v</code>, and
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(elt m i
    j)</span></samp>&rsquo; yields one element of a Calc
    matrix.</li>

    <li>The <code>setq</code> function has been extended to act
    like the Common Lisp <code>setf</code> function. (The name
    <code>setf</code> is recognized as a synonym of
    <code>setq</code>.) Specifically, the first argument of
    <code>setq</code> can be an <code>nth</code>, <code>elt</code>,
    <code>car</code>, or <code>cdr</code> form, in which case the
    effect is to store into the specified element of a list. Thus,
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(setq (elt m i j)
    x)</span></samp>&rsquo; stores &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; into one element of a
    matrix.</li>

    <li>A <code>for</code> looping construct is available. For
    example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(for ((i 0 10))
    body)</span></samp>&rsquo; executes <code>body</code> once for
    each binding of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; from zero to 10. This is like a
    <code>let</code> form in that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; is temporarily bound to the loop
    count without disturbing its value outside the <code>for</code>
    construct. Nested loops, as in &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">(for ((i 0 10) (j 0 (1- i) 2))
    body)</span></samp>&rsquo;, are also available. For each value
    of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; from
    zero to 10, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo; counts from 0 to
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i-1</span></samp>&rsquo; in
    steps of two. Note that <code>for</code> has the same general
    outline as <code>let*</code>, except that each element of the
    header is a list of three or four things, not just two.</li>

    <li>The <code>foreach</code> construct loops over elements of a
    list. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(foreach ((x
    (cdr v))) body)</span></samp>&rsquo; executes <code>body</code>
    with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;
    bound to each element of Calc vector &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">v</span></samp>&rsquo; in turn. The purpose of
    <code>cdr</code> here is to skip over the initial
    <code>vec</code> symbol in the vector.</li>

    <li>The <code>break</code> function breaks out of the innermost
    enclosing <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, or
    <code>foreach</code> loop. If given a value, as in
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(break x)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
    this value is returned by the loop. (Lisp loops otherwise
    always return <code>nil</code>.)</li>

    <li>The <code>return</code> function prematurely returns from
    the enclosing function. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">(return (+ x y))</span></samp>&rsquo; returns
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x+y</span></samp>&rsquo; as the
    value of a function. You can use <code>return</code> anywhere
    inside the body of the function.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Non-integer numbers (and extremely large integers) cannot be
  included directly into a <code>defmath</code> definition. This is
  because the Lisp reader will fail to parse them long before
  <code>defmath</code> ever gets control. Instead, use the
  notation, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">:"3.1415"</span></samp>&rsquo;. In fact, any algebraic
  formula can go between the quotes. For example,</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     (defmath sqexp (x)     ; sqexp(x) == sqrt(exp(x)) == exp(x*0.5)
       (and (numberp x)
            (exp :"x * 0.5")))
</pre>

  <p>expands to</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     (defun calcFunc-sqexp (x)
       (and (math-numberp x)
            (calcFunc-exp (math-mul x '(float 5 -1)))))
</pre>

  <p>Note the use of <code>numberp</code> as a guard to ensure that
  the argument is a number first, returning <code>nil</code> if
  not. The exponential function could itself have been included in
  the expression, if we had preferred: &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">:"exp(x * 0.5)"</span></samp>&rsquo;. As another example,
  the multiplication-and-recursion step of <code>myfact</code>
  could have been written</p>
  <pre class="example">
     :"n * myfact(n-1)"
</pre>

  <p>A good place to put your <code>defmath</code> commands is your
  Calc init file (the file given by
  <code>calc-settings-file</code>, typically <samp><span class=
  "file">~/.emacs.d/calc.el</span></samp>), which will not be
  loaded until Calc starts. If a file named <samp><span class=
  "file">.emacs</span></samp> exists in your home directory, Emacs
  reads and executes the Lisp forms in this file as it starts up.
  While it may seem reasonable to put your favorite
  <code>defmath</code> commands there, this has the unfortunate
  side-effect that parts of the Calculator must be loaded in to
  process the <code>defmath</code> commands whether or not you will
  actually use the Calculator! If you want to put the
  <code>defmath</code> commands there (for example, if you redefine
  <code>calc-settings-file</code> to be <samp><span class=
  "file">.emacs</span></samp>), a better effect can be had by
  writing</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (put 'calc-define 'thing '(progn
      (defmath ... )
      (defmath ... )
     ))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-calc_002ddefine-2323" id=
  "index-calc_002ddefine-2323"></a>The <code>put</code> function
  adds a <dfn>property</dfn> to a symbol. Each Lisp symbol has a
  list of properties associated with it. Here we add a property
  with a name of <code>thing</code> and a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(progn ...)</span></samp>&rsquo; form as its value. When
  Calc starts up, and at the start of every Calc command, the
  property list for the symbol <code>calc-define</code> is checked
  and the values of any properties found are evaluated as Lisp
  forms. The properties are removed as they are evaluated. The
  property names (like <code>thing</code>) are not used; you should
  choose something like the name of your project so as not to
  conflict with other properties.</p>

  <p>The net effect is that you can put the above code in your
  <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file and it will
  not be executed until Calc is loaded. Or, you can put that same
  code in another file which you load by hand either before or
  after Calc itself is loaded.</p>

  <p>The properties of <code>calc-define</code> are evaluated in
  the same order that they were added. They can assume that the
  Calc modules <samp><span class="file">calc.el</span></samp>,
  <samp><span class="file">calc-ext.el</span></samp>, and
  <samp><span class="file">calc-macs.el</span></samp> have been
  fully loaded, and that the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*Calculator*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer will be the
  current buffer.</p>

  <p>If your <code>calc-define</code> property only defines
  algebraic functions, you can be sure that it will have been
  evaluated before Calc tries to call your function, even if the
  file defining the property is loaded after Calc is loaded. But if
  the property defines commands or key sequences, it may not be
  evaluated soon enough. (Suppose it defines the new command
  <code>tweak-calc</code>; the user can load your file, then type
  <kbd>M-x tweak-calc</kbd> before Calc has had chance to do
  anything.) To protect against this situation, you can put</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (run-hooks 'calc-check-defines)
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-calc_002dcheck_002ddefines-2324" id=
  "index-calc_002dcheck_002ddefines-2324"></a>at the end of your
  file. The <code>calc-check-defines</code> function is what looks
  for and evaluates properties on <code>calc-define</code>;
  <code>run-hooks</code> has the advantage that it is quietly
  ignored if <code>calc-check-defines</code> is not yet defined
  because Calc has not yet been loaded.</p>

  <p>Examples of things that ought to be enclosed in a
  <code>calc-define</code> property are <code>defmath</code> calls,
  <code>define-key</code> calls that modify the Calc key map, and
  any calls that redefine things defined inside Calc. Ordinary
  <code>defun</code>s need not be enclosed with
  <code>calc-define</code>.</p>
