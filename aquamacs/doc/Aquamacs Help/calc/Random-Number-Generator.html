  <h4 class="subsection">9.5.1 Random Number Generator</h4>

  <p>Calc's random number generator uses several methods to ensure
  that the numbers it produces are highly random. Knuth's <em>Art
  of Computer Programming</em>, Volume II, contains a thorough
  description of the theory of random number generators and their
  measurement and characterization.</p>

  <p>If <code>RandSeed</code> has no stored value, Calc calls
  Emacs' built-in <code>random</code> function to get a stream of
  random numbers, which it then treats in various ways to avoid
  problems inherent in the simple random number generators that
  many systems use to implement <code>random</code>.</p>

  <p>When Calc's random number generator is first invoked, it
  &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; the low-level random sequence using the time
  of day, so that the random number sequence will be different
  every time you use Calc.</p>

  <p>Since Emacs Lisp doesn't specify the range of values that will
  be returned by its <code>random</code> function, Calc exercises
  the function several times to estimate the range. When Calc
  subsequently uses the <code>random</code> function, it takes only
  10 bits of the result near the most-significant end. (It avoids
  at least the bottom four bits, preferably more, and also tries to
  avoid the top two bits.) This strategy works well with the linear
  congruential generators that are typically used to implement
  <code>random</code>.</p>

  <p>If <code>RandSeed</code> contains an integer, Calc uses this
  integer to seed an &ldquo;additive congruential&rdquo; method
  (Knuth's algorithm 3.2.2A, computing
  <!-- @math{X_{n-55} - X_{n-24}}. -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X_n-55 -
  X_n-24</span></samp>&rsquo;). This method expands the seed value
  into a large table which is maintained internally; the variable
  <code>RandSeed</code> is changed from, e.g., 42 to the vector
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[42]</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  indicate that the seed has been absorbed into this table. When
  <code>RandSeed</code> contains a vector, <kbd>k r</kbd> and
  related commands continue to use the same internal table as last
  time. There is no way to extract the complete state of the random
  number generator so that you can restart it from any point; you
  can only restart it from the same initial seed value. A simple
  way to restart from the same seed is to type <kbd>s r
  RandSeed</kbd> to get the seed vector, <kbd>v u</kbd> to unpack
  it back into a number, then <kbd>s t RandSeed</kbd> to reseed the
  generator with that number.</p>

  <p>Calc uses a &ldquo;shuffling&rdquo; method as described in
  algorithm 3.2.2B of Knuth. It fills a table with 13 random 10-bit
  numbers. Then, to generate a new random number, it uses the
  previous number to index into the table, picks the value it finds
  there as the new random number, then replaces that table entry
  with a new value obtained from a call to the base random number
  generator (either the additive congruential generator or the
  <code>random</code> function supplied by the system). If there
  are any flaws in the base generator, shuffling will tend to even
  them out. But if the system provides an excellent
  <code>random</code> function, shuffling will not damage its
  randomness.</p>

  <p>To create a random integer of a certain number of digits, Calc
  builds the integer three decimal digits at a time. For each group
  of three digits, Calc calls its 10-bit shuffling random number
  generator (which returns a value from 0 to 1023); if the random
  value is 1000 or more, Calc throws it out and tries again until
  it gets a suitable value.</p>

  <p>To create a random floating-point number with precision
  <var>p</var>, Calc simply creates a random <var>p</var>-digit
  integer and multiplies by <!-- @math{10^{-p}}. -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10^-p</span></samp>&rsquo;. The
  resulting random numbers should be very clean, but note that
  relatively small numbers will have few significant random digits.
  In other words, with a precision of 12, you will occasionally get
  numbers on the order of <!-- @math{10^{-9}} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10^-9</span></samp>&rsquo; or
  <!-- @math{10^{-10}}, -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10^-10</span></samp>&rsquo;, but
  those numbers will only have two or three random digits since
  they correspond to small integers times <!-- @math{10^{-12}}. -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10^-12</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>To create a random integer in the interval
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0 ..</span>
  <var>m</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, Calc
  counts the digits in <var>m</var>, creates a random integer with
  three additional digits, then reduces modulo <var>m</var>. Unless
  <var>m</var> is a power of ten the resulting values will be very
  slightly biased toward the lower numbers, but this bias will be
  less than 0.1%. (For example, if <var>m</var> is 42, Calc will
  reduce a random integer less than 100000 modulo 42 to get a
  result less than 42. It is easy to show that the numbers 40 and
  41 will be only 2380/2381 as likely to result from this modulo
  operation as numbers 39 and below.) If <var>m</var> is a power of
  ten, however, the numbers should be completely unbiased.</p>

  <p>The Gaussian random numbers generated by
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">random(0.0)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  use the &ldquo;polar&rdquo; method described in Knuth section
  3.4.1C. This method generates a pair of Gaussian random numbers
  at a time, so only every other call to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">random(0.0)</span></samp>&rsquo; will require significant
  calculations.</p>
