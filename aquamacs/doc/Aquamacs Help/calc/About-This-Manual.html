  <h3 class="section">2.2 About This Manual</h3>

  <p class="noindent">This document serves as a complete
  description of the GNU Emacs Calculator. It works both as an
  introduction for novices and as a reference for experienced
  users. While it helps to have some experience with GNU Emacs in
  order to get the most out of Calc, this manual ought to be
  readable even if you don't know or use Emacs regularly.</p>

  <p>This manual is divided into three major parts: the
  &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; chapter you are reading now, the
  Calc tutorial, and the Calc reference manual.
  <!-- [when-split] -->

  <!-- This manual has been printed in two volumes, the @dfn{Tutorial} and the -->

  <!-- @dfn{Reference}.  Both volumes include a copy of the ``Getting Started'' -->
   <!-- chapter. --></p>

  <p>If you are in a hurry to use Calc, there is a brief
  &ldquo;demonstration&rdquo; below which illustrates the major
  features of Calc in just a couple of pages. If you don't have
  time to go through the full tutorial, this will show you
  everything you need to know to begin. See <a href=
  "Demonstration-of-Calc.html#Demonstration-of-Calc">Demonstration
  of Calc</a>.</p>

  <p>The tutorial chapter walks you through the various parts of
  Calc with lots of hands-on examples and explanations. If you are
  new to Calc and you have some time, try going through at least
  the beginning of the tutorial. The tutorial includes about 70
  exercises with answers. These exercises give you some guided
  practice with Calc, as well as pointing out some interesting and
  unusual ways to use its features.</p>

  <p>The reference section discusses Calc in complete depth. You
  can read the reference from start to finish if you want to learn
  every aspect of Calc. Or, you can look in the table of contents
  or the Concept Index to find the parts of the manual that discuss
  the things you need to know. <!-- @cindex Marginal notes --></p>

  <p>Every Calc keyboard command is listed in the Calc Summary, and
  also in the Key Index. Algebraic functions, <kbd>M-x</kbd>
  commands, and variables also have their own indices.
  <!-- @texline Each -->
   <!-- @infoline In the printed manual, each -->

  <!-- paragraph that is referenced in the Key or Function Index is marked -->
   <!-- in the margin with its index entry. -->
   <!-- [fix-ref Help Commands] --></p>

  <p>You can access this manual on-line at any time within Calc by
  pressing the <kbd>h i</kbd> key sequence. Outside of the Calc
  window, you can press <kbd>C-x * i</kbd> to read the manual
  on-line. From within Calc the command <kbd>h t</kbd> will jump
  directly to the Tutorial; from outside of Calc the command
  <kbd>C-x * t</kbd> will jump to the Tutorial and start Calc if
  necessary. Pressing <kbd>h s</kbd> or <kbd>C-x * s</kbd> will
  take you directly to the Calc Summary. Within Calc, you can also
  go to the part of the manual describing any Calc key, function,
  or variable using <kbd>h&nbsp;k</kbd><!-- /@w -->, <kbd>h
  f</kbd>, or <kbd>h v</kbd>, respectively. See <a href=
  "Help-Commands.html#Help-Commands">Help Commands</a>.</p>

  <p>The Calc manual can be printed, but because the manual is so
  large, you should only make a printed copy if you really need it.
  To print the manual, you will need the TeX typesetting program
  (this is a free program by Donald Knuth at Stanford University)
  as well as the <samp><span class="file">texindex</span></samp>
  program and <samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp>
  file, both of which can be obtained from the FSF as part of the
  <code>texinfo</code> package. To print the Calc manual in one
  huge tome, you will need the source code to this manual,
  <samp><span class="file">calc.texi</span></samp>, available as
  part of the Emacs source. Once you have this file, type
  <kbd>texi2dvi calc.texi</kbd>. Alternatively, change to the
  <samp><span class="file">man</span></samp> subdirectory of the
  Emacs source distribution, and type <kbd>make calc.dvi</kbd>.
  (Don't worry if you get some &ldquo;overfull box&rdquo; warnings
  while TeX runs.) The result will be a device-independent output
  file called <samp><span class="file">calc.dvi</span></samp>,
  which you must print in whatever way is right for your system. On
  many systems, the command is</p>
  <pre class="example">
     lpr -d calc.dvi
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">or</p>
  <pre class="example">
     dvips calc.dvi
</pre>
