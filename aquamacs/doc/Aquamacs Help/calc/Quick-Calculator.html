  <h3 class="section">4.6 &ldquo;Quick Calculator&rdquo; Mode</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-q-196" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-q-196"></a><a name=
  "index-quick_002dcalc-197" id=
  "index-quick_002dcalc-197"></a><a name=
  "index-Quick-Calculator-198" id=
  "index-Quick-Calculator-198"></a>There is another way to invoke
  the Calculator if all you need to do is make one or two quick
  calculations. Type <kbd>C-x * q</kbd> (or <kbd>M-x
  quick-calc</kbd>), then type any formula as an algebraic entry.
  The Calculator will compute the result and display it in the echo
  area, without ever actually putting up a Calc window.</p>

  <p>You can use the <kbd>$</kbd> character in a Quick Calculator
  formula to refer to the previous Quick Calculator result. Older
  results are not retained; the Quick Calculator has no effect on
  the full Calculator's stack or trail. If you compute a result and
  then forget what it was, just run <code>C-x * q</code> again and
  enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; as
  the formula.</p>

  <p>If this is the first time you have used the Calculator in this
  Emacs session, the <kbd>C-x * q</kbd> command will create the
  <code>*Calculator*</code> buffer and perform all the usual
  initializations; it simply will refrain from putting that buffer
  up in a new window. The Quick Calculator refers to the
  <code>*Calculator*</code> buffer for all mode settings. Thus, for
  example, to set the precision that the Quick Calculator uses,
  simply run the full Calculator momentarily and use the regular
  <kbd>p</kbd> command.</p>

  <p>If you use <code>C-x * q</code> from inside the Calculator
  buffer, the effect is the same as pressing the apostrophe key
  (algebraic entry).</p>

  <p>The result of a Quick calculation is placed in the Emacs
  &ldquo;kill ring&rdquo; as well as being displayed. A subsequent
  <kbd>C-y</kbd> command will yank the result into the editing
  buffer. You can also use this to yank the result into the next
  <kbd>C-x * q</kbd> input line as a more explicit alternative to
  <kbd>$</kbd> notation, or to yank the result into the Calculator
  stack after typing <kbd>C-x * c</kbd>.</p>

  <p>If you finish your formula by typing &lt;LFD&gt; (or
  <kbd>C-j</kbd>) instead of &lt;RET&gt;, the result is inserted
  immediately into the current buffer rather than going into the
  kill ring.</p>

  <p>Quick Calculator results are actually evaluated as if by the
  <kbd>=</kbd> key (which replaces variable names by their stored
  values, if any). If the formula you enter is an assignment to a
  variable using the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; operator, say,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo := 2 + 3</span></samp>&rsquo;
  or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo := foo +
  1</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the result of the evaluation is
  stored in that Calc variable. See <a href=
  "Store-and-Recall.html#Store-and-Recall">Store and
  Recall</a>.</p>

  <p>If the result is an integer and the current display radix is
  decimal, the number will also be displayed in hex, octal and
  binary formats. If the integer is in the range from 1 to 126, it
  will also be displayed as an ASCII character.</p>

  <p>For example, the quoted character &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">"x"</span></samp>&rsquo; produces the vector result
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[120]</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (because 120 is the ASCII code of the lower-case `x'; see
  <a href="Strings.html#Strings">Strings</a>). Since this is a
  vector, not an integer, it is displayed only according to the
  current mode settings. But running Quick Calc again and entering
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">120</span></samp>&rsquo; will
  produce the result &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">120 (16#78,
  8#170, x)</span></samp>&rsquo; which shows the number in its
  decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and ASCII forms.</p>

  <p>Please note that the Quick Calculator is not any faster at
  loading or computing the answer than the full Calculator; the
  name &ldquo;quick&rdquo; merely refers to the fact that it's much
  less hassle to use for small calculations.</p>
