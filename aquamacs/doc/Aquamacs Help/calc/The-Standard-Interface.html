  <h4 class="subsection">2.5.2 The Standard Calc Interface</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-Standard-user-interface-2" id=
  "index-Standard-user-interface-2"></a>Calc's standard interface
  acts like a traditional RPN calculator, operated by the normal
  Emacs keyboard. When you type <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> to start the
  Calculator, the Emacs screen splits into two windows with the
  file you were editing on top and Calc on the bottom.</p>

</pre>

  <p>In this figure, the mode-line for <samp><span class=
  "file">myfile</span></samp> has moved up and the
  &ldquo;Calculator&rdquo; window has appeared below it. As you can
  see, Calc actually makes two windows side-by-side. The lefthand
  one is called the <dfn>stack window</dfn> and the righthand one
  is called the <dfn>trail window.</dfn> The stack holds the
  numbers involved in the calculation you are currently performing.
  The trail holds a complete record of all calculations you have
  done. In a desk calculator with a printer, the trail corresponds
  to the paper tape that records what you do.</p>

  <p>In this case, the trail shows that four numbers (17.3, 3, 2,
  and 4) were first entered into the Calculator, then the 2 and 4
  were multiplied to get 8, then the 3 and 8 were subtracted to get
  <i>-5</i>. (The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol shows that this was the
  most recent calculation.) The net result is the two numbers 17.3
  and <i>-5</i> sitting on the stack.</p>

  <p>Most Calculator commands deal explicitly with the stack only,
  but there is a set of commands that allow you to search back
  through the trail and retrieve any previous result.</p>

  <p>Calc commands use the digits, letters, and punctuation keys.
  Shifted (i.e., upper-case) letters are different from lowercase
  letters. Some letters are <dfn>prefix</dfn> keys that begin
  two-letter commands. For example, <kbd>e</kbd> means &ldquo;enter
  exponent&rdquo; and shifted <kbd>E</kbd> means
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e^x</span></samp>&rsquo;. With
  the <kbd>d</kbd> (&ldquo;display modes&rdquo;) prefix the letter
  &ldquo;e&rdquo; takes on very different meanings: <kbd>d e</kbd>
  means &ldquo;engineering notation&rdquo; and <kbd>d E</kbd> means
  &ldquo;<dfn>eqn</dfn> language mode.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There is nothing stopping you from switching out of the Calc
  window and back into your editing window, say by using the Emacs
  <kbd>C-x&nbsp;o</kbd><!-- /@w --> (<code>other-window</code>)
  command. When the cursor is inside a regular window, Emacs acts
  just like normal. When the cursor is in the Calc stack or trail
  windows, keys are interpreted as Calc commands.</p>

  <p>When you quit by pressing <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> a second time,
  the Calculator windows go away but the actual Stack and Trail are
  not gone, just hidden. When you press <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> once
  again you will get the same stack and trail contents you had when
  you last used the Calculator.</p>

  <p>The Calculator does not remember its state between Emacs
  sessions. Thus if you quit Emacs and start it again, <kbd>C-x *
  c</kbd> will give you a fresh stack and trail. There is a command
  (<kbd>m m</kbd>) that lets you save your favorite mode settings
  between sessions, though. One of the things it saves is which
  user interface (standard or Keypad) you last used; otherwise, a
  freshly started Emacs will always treat <kbd>C-x * *</kbd> the
  same as <kbd>C-x * c</kbd>.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>q</kbd> key is another equivalent way to turn the
  Calculator off.</p>

  <p>If you type <kbd>C-x * b</kbd> first and then <kbd>C-x *
  c</kbd>, you get a full-screen version of Calc
  (<code>full-calc</code>) in which the stack and trail windows are
  still side-by-side but are now as tall as the whole Emacs screen.
  When you press <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> again to quit,
  the file you were editing before reappears. The <kbd>C-x *
  b</kbd> key switches back and forth between &ldquo;big&rdquo;
  full-screen mode and the normal partial-screen mode.</p>

  <p>Finally, <kbd>C-x * o</kbd> (<code>calc-other-window</code>)
  is like <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> except that the Calc window is not
  selected. The buffer you were editing before remains selected
  instead. If you are in a Calc window, then <kbd>C-x * o</kbd>
  will switch you out of it, being careful not to switch you to the
  Calc Trail window. So <kbd>C-x * o</kbd> is a handy way to switch
  out of Calc momentarily to edit your file; you can then type
  <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> to switch back into Calc when you are
  done.</p>
