  <h4 class="subsection">11.11.11 Automatic Rewrites</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name=
  "index-g_t_0040code_007bEvalRules_007d-variable-1951" id=
  "index-g_t_0040code_007bEvalRules_007d-variable-1951"></a><a name="index-EvalRules-1952"
  id="index-EvalRules-1952"></a>It is possible to get Calc to apply
  a set of rewrite rules on all results, effectively adding to the
  built-in set of default simplifications. To do this, simply store
  your rule set in the variable <code>EvalRules</code>. There is a
  convenient <kbd>s E</kbd> command for editing
  <code>EvalRules</code>; see <a href=
  "Operations-on-Variables.html#Operations-on-Variables">Operations
  on Variables</a>.</p>

  <p>For example, suppose you want &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sin(a + b)</span></samp>&rsquo; to be expanded out to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(b) cos(a) + cos(b)
  sin(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; wherever it appears, and similarly
  for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cos(a +
  b)</span></samp>&rsquo;. The corresponding rewrite rule set would
  be,</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     [ sin(a + b)  :=  cos(a) sin(b) + sin(a) cos(b),
       cos(a + b)  :=  cos(a) cos(b) - sin(a) sin(b) ]
</pre>

  <p>To apply these manually, you could put them in a variable
  called <code>trigexp</code> and then use <kbd>a r trigexp</kbd>
  every time you wanted to expand trig functions. But if instead
  you store them in the variable <code>EvalRules</code>, they will
  automatically be applied to all sines and cosines of sums. Then,
  with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">45</span></samp>&rsquo; on the
  stack, typing <kbd>+ S</kbd> will (assuming Degrees mode) result
  in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0.7071 sin(2 x) + 0.7071 cos(2
  x)</span></samp>&rsquo; automatically.</p>

  <p>As each level of a formula is evaluated, the rules from
  <code>EvalRules</code> are applied before the default
  simplifications. Rewriting continues until no further
  <code>EvalRules</code> apply. Note that this is different from
  the usual order of application of rewrite rules:
  <code>EvalRules</code> works from the bottom up, simplifying the
  arguments to a function before the function itself, while <kbd>a
  r</kbd> applies rules from the top down.</p>

  <p>Because the <code>EvalRules</code> are tried first, you can
  use them to override the normal behavior of any built-in Calc
  function.</p>

  <p>It is important not to write a rule that will get into an
  infinite loop. For example, the rule set
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[f(0) := 1, f(n) := n
  f(n-1)]</span></samp>&rsquo; appears to be a good definition of a
  factorial function, but it is unsafe. Imagine what happens if
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(2.5)</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  simplified. Calc will continue to subtract 1 from this argument
  forever without reaching zero. A safer second rule would be
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(n) := n f(n-1) ::
  n&gt;0</span></samp>&rsquo;. Another dangerous rule is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g(x, y) := g(y,
  x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Rewriting &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">g(2, 4)</span></samp>&rsquo;, this would bounce back and
  forth between that and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g(4,
  2)</span></samp>&rsquo; forever. If an infinite loop in
  <code>EvalRules</code> occurs, Emacs will eventually stop with a
  &ldquo;Computation got stuck or ran too long&rdquo; message.</p>

  <p>Another subtle difference between <code>EvalRules</code> and
  regular rewrites concerns rules that rewrite a formula into an
  identical formula. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(n) := f(floor(n))</span></samp>&rsquo; &ldquo;fails to
  match&rdquo; when &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; is already an integer. But in
  <code>EvalRules</code> this case is detected only if the
  righthand side literally becomes the original formula before any
  further simplification. This means that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(n) := f(floor(n))</span></samp>&rsquo; will get into an
  infinite loop if it occurs in <code>EvalRules</code>. Calc will
  replace &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(6)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(floor(6))</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is different from
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(6)</span></samp>&rsquo;, so it
  will consider the rule to have matched and will continue
  simplifying that formula; first the argument is simplified to get
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(6)</span></samp>&rsquo;, then
  the rule matches again to get &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(floor(6))</span></samp>&rsquo; again, ad infinitum. A
  much safer rule would check its argument first, say, with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(n) := f(floor(n)) ::
  !dint(n)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>(What really happens is that the rewrite mechanism substitutes
  the meta-variables in the righthand side of a rule, compares to
  see if the result is the same as the original formula and fails
  if so, then uses the default simplifications to simplify the
  result and compares again (and again fails if the formula has
  simplified back to its original form). The only special wrinkle
  for the <code>EvalRules</code> is that the same rules will come
  back into play when the default simplifications are used. What
  Calc wants to do is build &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(floor(6))</span></samp>&rsquo;, see that this is
  different from the original formula, simplify to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(6)</span></samp>&rsquo;, see
  that this is the same as the original formula, and thus halt the
  rewriting. But while simplifying, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(6)</span></samp>&rsquo; will again trigger the same
  <code>EvalRules</code> rule and Calc will get into a loop inside
  the rewrite mechanism itself.)</p>

  <p>The <code>phase</code>, <code>schedule</code>, and
  <code>iterations</code> markers do not work in
  <code>EvalRules</code>. If the rule set is divided into phases,
  only the phase 1 rules are applied, and the schedule is ignored.
  The rules are always repeated as many times as possible.</p>

  <p>The <code>EvalRules</code> are applied to all function calls
  in a formula, but not to numbers (and other number-like objects
  like error forms), nor to vectors or individual variable names.
  (Though they will apply to <em>components</em> of vectors and
  error forms when appropriate.) You might try to make a variable
  <code>phihat</code> which automatically expands to its definition
  without the need to press <kbd>=</kbd> by writing the rule
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">quote(phihat) :=
  (1-sqrt(5))/2</span></samp>&rsquo;, but unfortunately this rule
  will not work as part of <code>EvalRules</code>.</p>

  <p>Finally, another limitation is that Calc sometimes calls its
  built-in functions directly rather than going through the default
  simplifications. When it does this, <code>EvalRules</code> will
  not be able to override those functions. For example, when you
  take the absolute value of the complex number
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(2, 3)</span></samp>&rsquo;, Calc
  computes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(2*2 +
  3*3)</span></samp>&rsquo; by calling the multiplication,
  addition, and square root functions directly rather than applying
  the default simplifications to this formula. So an
  <code>EvalRules</code> rule that (perversely) rewrites
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(13) :=
  6</span></samp>&rsquo; would not apply. (However, if you put Calc
  into Symbolic mode so that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(13)</span></samp>&rsquo; will be left in symbolic
  form by the built-in square root function, your rule will be able
  to apply. But if the complex number were
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(3,4)</span></samp>&rsquo;, so
  that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(25)</span></samp>&rsquo; must be calculated, then
  Symbolic mode will not help because &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(25)</span></samp>&rsquo; can be evaluated exactly to
  5.)</p>

  <p>One subtle restriction that normally only manifests itself
  with <code>EvalRules</code> is that while a given rewrite rule is
  in the process of being checked, that same rule cannot be
  recursively applied. Calc effectively removes the rule from its
  rule set while checking the rule, then puts it back once the
  match succeeds or fails. (The technical reason for this is that
  compiled pattern programs are not reentrant.) For example,
  consider the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo(x) := x ::
  foo(x/2) &gt; 0</span></samp>&rsquo; attempting to match
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo(8)</span></samp>&rsquo;. This
  rule will be inactive while the condition
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo(4) &gt;
  0</span></samp>&rsquo; is checked, even though it might be an
  integral part of evaluating that condition. Note that this is not
  a problem for the more usual recursive type of rule, such as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo(x) :=
  foo(x/2)</span></samp>&rsquo;, because there the rule has
  succeeded and been reactivated by the time the righthand side is
  evaluated.</p>

  <p>If <code>EvalRules</code> has no stored value (its default
  state), or if anything but a vector is stored in it, then it is
  ignored.</p>

  <p>Even though Calc's rewrite mechanism is designed to compare
  rewrite rules to formulas as quickly as possible, storing rules
  in <code>EvalRules</code> may make Calc run substantially slower.
  This is particularly true of rules where the top-level call is a
  commonly used function, or is not fixed. The rule
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(n) := n f(n-1) ::
  n&gt;0</span></samp>&rsquo; will only activate the rewrite
  mechanism for calls to the function <code>f</code>, but
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lg(n) + lg(m) := lg(n
  m)</span></samp>&rsquo; will check every
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operator.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     apply(f, [a*b]) := apply(f, [a]) + apply(f, [b]) :: in(f, [ln, log10])
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">may seem more &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; than
  two separate rules for <code>ln</code> and <code>log10</code>,
  but actually it is vastly less efficient because rules with
  <code>apply</code> as the top-level pattern must be tested
  against <em>every</em> function call that is simplified.</p>

  <code>AlgSimpRules</code> holds rules for this purpose. The
  <kbd>a s</kbd> command will apply <code>EvalRules</code> and
  <code>AlgSimpRules</code> to the formula, as well as all of its
  built-in simplifications.</p>

  <p>Most of the special limitations for <code>EvalRules</code>
  don't apply to <code>AlgSimpRules</code>. Calc simply does an
  <kbd>a r AlgSimpRules</kbd> command with an infinite repeat count
  as the first step of <kbd>a s</kbd>. It then applies its own
  built-in simplifications throughout the formula, and then repeats
  these two steps (along with applying the default simplifications)
  until no further changes are possible.</p>
