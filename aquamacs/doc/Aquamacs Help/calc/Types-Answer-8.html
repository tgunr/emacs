  <h4 class="subsection">3.7.40 Types Tutorial Exercise 8</h4>

  <p class="noindent">The first answer is pretty simple:
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / (0 .. 10) = (0.1 ..
  inf)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Since a number in the interval
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(0 .. 10)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  can get arbitrarily close to zero, its reciprocal can get
  arbitrarily large, so the answer is an interval that effectively
  means, &ldquo;any number greater than 0.1&rdquo; but with no
  upper bound.</p>

  <p>The second answer, similarly, is &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1 / (-10 .. 0) = (-inf .. -0.1)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Calc normally treats division by zero as an error, so that the
  formula &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1&nbsp;/&nbsp;0</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> is left
  unsimplified. Our third problem, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1&nbsp;/&nbsp;[0&nbsp;..&nbsp;10]</span></samp>&rsquo;
  <!-- /@w -->, also (potentially) divides by zero because zero is
  now a member of the interval. So Calc leaves this one
  unevaluated, too.</p>

  <p>If you turn on Infinite mode by pressing <kbd>m i</kbd>, you
  will instead get the answer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0.1
  .. inf]</span></samp>&rsquo;, which includes infinity as a
  possible value.</p>

  <p>The fourth calculation, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 /
  (-10 .. 10)</span></samp>&rsquo;, has the same problem. Zero is
  buried inside the interval, but it's still a possible value. It's
  not hard to see that the actual result of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / (-10 ..
  10)</span></samp>&rsquo; will be either greater than <i>0.1</i>,
  or less than <i>-0.1</i>. Thus the interval goes from minus
  infinity to plus infinity, with a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in it from
  <i>-0.1</i> to <i>0.1</i>. Calc doesn't have any way to represent
  this, so it just reports &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[-inf ..
  inf]</span></samp>&rsquo; as the answer. It may be disappointing
  to hear &ldquo;the answer lies somewhere between minus infinity
  and plus infinity, inclusive,&rdquo; but that's the best that
  interval arithmetic can do in this case.</p>
