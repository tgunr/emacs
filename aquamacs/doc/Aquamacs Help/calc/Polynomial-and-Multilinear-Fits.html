  <h4 class="subsection">11.8.2 Polynomial and Multilinear
  Fits</h4>

  <p class="noindent">To fit the data to higher-order polynomials,
  just type one of the digits <kbd>2</kbd> through <kbd>9</kbd>
  when prompted for a model. For example, we could fit the original
  data matrix from the previous section (with 13, not 14) to a
  parabola instead of a line by typing <kbd>a F 2
  &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     2.00000000001 x - 1.5e-12 x^2 + 2.99999999999
</pre>

  <p>Note that since the constant and linear terms are enough to
  fit the data exactly, it's no surprise that Calc chose a tiny
  contribution for &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo;. (The fact that it's not exactly
  zero is due only to roundoff error. Since our data are exact
  integers, we could get an exact answer by typing <kbd>m f</kbd>
  first to get Fraction mode. Then the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; term would vanish altogether.
  Usually, though, the data being fitted will be approximate floats
  so Fraction mode won't help.)</p>

  <p>Doing the <kbd>a F 2</kbd> fit on the data set with 14 instead
  of 13 gives a much larger &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; contribution, as Calc bends the
  line slightly to improve the fit.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     0.142857142855 x^2 + 1.34285714287 x + 3.59999999998
</pre>

  <p>An important result from the theory of polynomial fitting is
  that it is always possible to fit <var>n</var> data points
  exactly using a polynomial of degree <var>n</var><i>-1</i>,
  sometimes called an <dfn>interpolating polynomial</dfn>. Using
  the modified (14) data matrix, a model number of 4 gives a
  polynomial that exactly matches all five data points:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     0.04167 x^4 - 0.4167 x^3 + 1.458 x^2 - 0.08333 x + 4.
</pre>

  <p>The actual coefficients we get with a precision of 12, like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">0.0416666663588</span></samp>&rsquo;, clearly suffer from
  loss of precision. It is a good idea to increase the working
  precision to several digits beyond what you need when you do a
  fitting operation. Or, if your data are exact, use Fraction mode
  to get exact results.</p>

  <p>You can type <kbd>i</kbd> instead of a digit at the model
  prompt to fit the data exactly to a polynomial. This just counts
  the number of columns of the data matrix to choose the degree of
  the polynomial automatically.</p>

  <p>Fitting data &ldquo;exactly&rdquo; to high-degree polynomials
  is not always a good idea, though. High-degree polynomials have a
  tendency to wiggle uncontrollably in between the fitting data
  points. Also, if the exact-fit polynomial is going to be used to
  interpolate or extrapolate the data, it is numerically better to
  use the <kbd>a p</kbd> command described below. See <a href=
  "Interpolation.html#Interpolation">Interpolation</a>.</p>

  <p>Another generalization of the linear model is to assume the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; values are
  a sum of linear contributions from several
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; values.
  This is a <dfn>multilinear</dfn> fit, and it is also selected by
  the <kbd>1</kbd> digit key. (Calc decides whether the fit is
  linear or multilinear by counting the rows in the data
  matrix.)</p>

  <p>Given the data matrix,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     [ [  1,   2,   3,    4,   5  ]
       [  7,   2,   3,    5,   2  ]
       [ 14.5, 15, 18.5, 22.5, 24 ] ]
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">the command <kbd>a F 1 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> will
  call the first row &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and the second row
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;, and will
  fit the values in the third row to the model
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b x + c
  y</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     8. + 3. x + 0.5 y
</pre>

  <p>Calc can do multilinear fits with any number of independent
  variables (i.e., with any number of data rows).</p>

  <p>Yet another variation is <dfn>homogeneous</dfn> linear models,
  in which the constant term is known to be zero. In the linear
  case, this means the model formula is simply
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x</span></samp>&rsquo;; in the
  multilinear case, the model might be &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a x + b y + c z</span></samp>&rsquo;; and in the
  polynomial case, the model could be &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a x + b x^2 + c x^3</span></samp>&rsquo;. You can get a
  homogeneous linear or multilinear model by pressing the letter
  <kbd>h</kbd> followed by a regular model key, like <kbd>1</kbd>
  or <kbd>2</kbd>. This will be indicated by an &ldquo;h&rdquo; in
  the minibuffer after the help message.</p>

  <p>It is certainly possible to have other constrained linear
  models, like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2.3 + a
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a - 4
  x</span></samp>&rsquo;. While there is no single key to select
  models like these, a later section shows how to enter any desired
  model by hand. In the first case, for example, you would enter
  <kbd>a F ' 2.3 + a x</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Another class of models that will work but must be entered by
  hand are multinomial fits, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a + b x + c y + d x^2 + e y^2 + f x
  y</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
