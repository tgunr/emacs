  <h3 class="section">17.2 More About Embedded Mode</h3>

  <p class="noindent">When Embedded mode &ldquo;activates&rdquo; a
  formula, i.e., when it examines the formula for the first time
  since the buffer was created or loaded, Calc tries to sense the
  language in which the formula was written. If the formula
  contains any LaTeX-like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; sequences, it is parsed (i.e.,
  read) in LaTeX mode. If the formula appears to be written in
  multi-line Big mode, it is parsed in Big mode. Otherwise, it is
  parsed according to the current language mode.</p>

  <p>Note that Calc does not change the current language mode
  according the formula it reads in. Even though it can read a
  LaTeX formula when not in LaTeX mode, it will immediately rewrite
  this formula using whatever language mode is in effect.</p>

  <p><a name="index-d-p-2226" id="index-d-p-2226"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dshow_002dplain-2227" id=
  "index-calc_002dshow_002dplain-2227"></a>Calc's parser is unable
  to read certain kinds of formulas. For example, with <kbd>v
  ]</kbd> (<code>calc-matrix-brackets</code>) you can specify
  matrix display styles which the parser is unable to recognize as
  matrices. The <kbd>d p</kbd> (<code>calc-show-plain</code>)
  command turns on a mode in which a &ldquo;plain&rdquo; version of
  a formula is placed in front of the fully-formatted version. When
  Calc reads a formula that has such a plain version in front, it
  reads the plain version and ignores the formatted version.</p>

  <p>Plain formulas are preceded and followed by
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%%</span></samp>&rsquo; signs by
  default. This notation has the advantage that the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; character
  begins a comment in TeX and LaTeX, so if your formula is embedded
  in a TeX or LaTeX document its plain version will be invisible in
  the final printed copy. Certain major modes have different
  delimiters to ensure that the &ldquo;plain&rdquo; version will be
  in a comment for those modes, also. See <a href=
  "Customizing-Embedded-Mode.html#Customizing-Embedded-Mode">Customizing
  Embedded Mode</a> to see how to change the &ldquo;plain&rdquo;
  formula delimiters.</p>

  <p>There are several notations which Calc's parser for
  &ldquo;big&rdquo; formatted formulas can't yet recognize. In
  particular, it can't read the large symbols for <code>sum</code>,
  <code>prod</code>, and <code>integ</code>, and it can't handle
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; with
  the righthand argument omitted. Also, Calc won't recognize
  special formats you have defined with the <kbd>Z C</kbd> command
  (see <a href=
  "User_002dDefined-Compositions.html#User_002dDefined-Compositions">
  User-Defined Compositions</a>). In these cases it is important to
  use &ldquo;plain&rdquo; mode to make sure Calc will be able to
  read your formula later.</p>

  <p>Another example where &ldquo;plain&rdquo; mode is important is
  if you have specified a float mode with few digits of precision.
  Normally any digits that are computed but not displayed will
  simply be lost when you save and re-load your embedded buffer,
  but &ldquo;plain&rdquo; mode allows you to make sure that the
  complete number is present in the file as well as the
  rounded-down number.</p>

  <p>Embedded buffers remember active formulas for as long as they
  exist in Emacs memory. Suppose you have an embedded formula which
  is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pi</span></samp>&rsquo; to the
  normal 12 decimal places, and then type
  <kbd>C-u&nbsp;5&nbsp;d&nbsp;n</kbd><!-- /@w --> to display only
  five decimal places. If you then type <kbd>d n</kbd>, all 12
  places reappear because the full number is still there on the
  Calc stack. More surprisingly, even if you exit Embedded mode and
  later re-enter it for that formula, typing <kbd>d n</kbd> will
  restore all 12 places because each buffer remembers all its
  active formulas. However, if you save the buffer in a file and
  reload it in a new Emacs session, all non-displayed digits will
  have been lost unless you used &ldquo;plain&rdquo; mode.</p>

  <p>In some applications of Embedded mode, you will want to have a
  sequence of copies of a formula that show its evolution as you
  work on it. For example, you might want to have a sequence like
  this in your file (elaborating here on the example from the
  &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; chapter):</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     The derivative of

                                   ln(ln(x))

     is

                       <span class=
"roman">(the derivative of </span>ln(ln(x))<span class=
"roman">)</span>

     whose value at x = 2 is

                                 <span class=
"roman">(the value)</span>

     and at x = 3 is

                                 <span class=
"roman">(the value)</span>
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-d-2228" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-d-2228"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dduplicate-2229" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dduplicate-2229"></a>The <kbd>C-x *
  d</kbd> (<code>calc-embedded-duplicate</code>) command is a handy
  way to make sequences like this. If you type <kbd>C-x * d</kbd>,
  the formula under the cursor (which may or may not have Embedded
  mode enabled for it at the time) is copied immediately below and
  Embedded mode is then enabled for that copy.</p>

  <p>For this example, you would start with just</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     The derivative of

                                   ln(ln(x))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">and press <kbd>C-x * d</kbd> with the cursor
  on this formula. The result is</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     The derivative of

                                   ln(ln(x))


                                   ln(ln(x))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">with the second copy of the formula enabled
  in Embedded mode. You can now press <kbd>a d x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
  to take the derivative, and <kbd>C-x * d C-x * d</kbd> to make
  two more copies of the derivative. To complete the computations,
  type <kbd>3 s l x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to evaluate the last formula,
  then move up to the second-to-last formula and type <kbd>2 s l x
  &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Finally, you would want to press <kbd>C-x * e</kbd> to exit
  Embedded mode, then go up and insert the necessary text in
  between the various formulas and numbers.</p>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-f-2230" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-f-2230"></a><a name=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-_0027-2231" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-_0027-2231"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dnew_002dformula-2232" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dnew_002dformula-2232"></a>The
  <kbd>C-x * f</kbd> (<code>calc-embedded-new-formula</code>)
  command creates a new embedded formula at the current point. It
  inserts some default delimiters, which are usually just blank
  lines, and then does an algebraic entry to get the formula (which
  is then enabled for Embedded mode). This is just shorthand for
  typing the delimiters yourself, positioning the cursor between
  the new delimiters, and pressing <kbd>C-x * e</kbd>. The key
  sequence <kbd>C-x * '</kbd> is equivalent to <kbd>C-x *
  f</kbd>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-n-2233" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-n-2233"></a><a name=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-p-2234" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-p-2234"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dnext-2235" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dnext-2235"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dprevious-2236" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dprevious-2236"></a>The <kbd>C-x *
  n</kbd> (<code>calc-embedded-next</code>) and <kbd>C-x * p</kbd>
  (<code>calc-embedded-previous</code>) commands move the cursor to
  the next or previous active embedded formula in the buffer. They
  can take positive or negative prefix arguments to move by several
  formulas. Note that these commands do not actually examine the
  text of the buffer looking for formulas; they only see formulas
  which have previously been activated in Embedded mode. In fact,
  <kbd>C-x * n</kbd> and <kbd>C-x * p</kbd> are a useful way to
  tell which embedded formulas are currently active. Also, note
  that these commands do not enable Embedded mode on the next or
  previous formula, they just move the cursor.</p>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-_0060-2237" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-_0060-2237"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dedit-2238" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dedit-2238"></a>The <kbd>C-x *
  `</kbd> (<code>calc-embedded-edit</code>) command edits the
  embedded formula at the current point as if by <kbd>`</kbd>
  (<code>calc-edit</code>). Embedded mode does not have to be
  enabled for this to work. Press <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to finish the
  edit, or <kbd>C-x k</kbd> to cancel.</p>
