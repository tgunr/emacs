  <h4 class="subsection">3.7.8 Modes Tutorial Exercise 1</h4>

  <p class="noindent">Calc always stores its numbers in decimal, so
  even though one-third has an exact base-3 representation
  (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3#0.1</span></samp>&rsquo;), it
  is still stored as 0.3333333 (chopped off after 12 or however
  many decimal digits) inside the calculator's memory. When this
  inexact number is converted back to base 3 for display, it may
  still be slightly inexact. When we multiply this number by 3, we
  get 0.999999, also an inexact value.</p>

  <p>When Calc displays a number in base 3, it has to decide how
  many digits to show. If the current precision is 12 (decimal)
  digits, that corresponds to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12 /
  log10(3) = 25.15</span></samp>&rsquo; base-3 digits. Because
  25.15 is not an exact integer, Calc shows only 25 digits, with
  the result that stored numbers carry a little bit of extra
  information that may not show up on the screen. When Joe entered
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3#0.2</span></samp>&rsquo;, the
  stored number 0.666666 happened to round to a pleasing value when
  it lost that last 0.15 of a digit, but it was still inexact in
  Calc's memory. When he divided by 2, he still got the dreaded
  inexact value 0.333333. (Actually, he divided 0.666667 by 2 to
  get 0.333334, which is why he got something a little higher than
  <code>3#0.1</code> instead of a little lower.)</p>

  <p>If Joe didn't want to be bothered with all this, he could have
  typed <kbd>M-24 d n</kbd> to display with one less digit than the
  default. (If you give <kbd>d n</kbd> a negative argument, it uses
  default-minus-that, so <kbd>M-- d n</kbd> would be an easier way
  to get the same effect.) Those inexact results would still be
  lurking there, but they would now be rounded to nice,
  natural-looking values for display purposes. (Remember,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0.022222</span></samp>&rsquo; in
  base 3 is like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">0.099999</span></samp>&rsquo; in base 10; rounding off one
  digit will round the number up to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">0.1</span></samp>&rsquo;.) Depending on the nature of your
  work, this hiding of the inexactness may be a benefit or a
  danger. With the <kbd>d n</kbd> command, Calc gives you the
  choice.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, another consequence of all this is that if you
  type <kbd>M-30 d n</kbd> to display more digits than are
  &ldquo;really there,&rdquo; you'll see garbage digits at the end
  of the number. (In decimal display mode, with decimally-stored
  numbers, these garbage digits are always zero so they vanish and
  you don't notice them.) Because Calc rounds off that 0.15 digit,
  there is the danger that two numbers could be slightly different
  internally but still look the same. If you feel uneasy about
  this, set the <kbd>d n</kbd> precision to be a little higher than
  normal; you'll get ugly garbage digits, but you'll always be able
  to tell two distinct numbers apart.</p>

  <p>An interesting side note is that most computers store their
  floating-point numbers in binary, and convert to decimal for
  display. Thus everyday programs have the same problem: Decimal
  0.1 cannot be represented exactly in binary (try it: <kbd>0.1 d
  2</kbd>), so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0.1 *
  10</span></samp>&rsquo; comes out as an inexact approximation to
  1 on some machines (though they generally arrange to hide it from
  you by rounding off one digit as we did above). Because Calc
  works in decimal instead of binary, you can be sure that numbers
  that look exact <em>are</em> exact as long as you stay in decimal
  display mode.</p>

  <p>It's not hard to show that any number that can be represented
  exactly in binary, octal, or hexadecimal is also exact in
  decimal, so the kinds of problems we saw in this exercise are
  likely to be severe only when you use a relatively unusual radix
  like 3.</p>
