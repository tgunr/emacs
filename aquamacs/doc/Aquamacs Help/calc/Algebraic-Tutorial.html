  <h4 class="subsection">3.1.2 Algebraic-Style Calculations</h4>

  <p class="noindent">If you are not used to RPN notation, you may
  prefer to operate the Calculator in Algebraic mode, which is
  closer to the way non-RPN calculators work. In Algebraic mode,
  you enter formulas in traditional &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2+3</span></samp>&rsquo; notation.</p>

  <p><strong>Notice:</strong> Calc gives &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; lower precedence than
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, so that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a/b*c</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  interpreted as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a/(b*c)</span></samp>&rsquo;; this is not standard across
  all computer languages. See below for details.</p>

  <p>You don't really need any special &ldquo;mode&rdquo; to enter
  algebraic formulas. You can enter a formula at any time by
  pressing the apostrophe (<kbd>'</kbd>) key. Answer the prompt
  with the desired formula, then press &lt;RET&gt;. The formula is
  evaluated and the result is pushed onto the RPN stack. If you
  don't want to think in RPN at all, you can enter your whole
  computation as a formula, read the result from the stack, then
  press &lt;DEL&gt; to delete it from the stack.</p>

  <p>Try pressing the apostrophe key, then <kbd>2+3+4</kbd>, then
  &lt;RET&gt;. The result should be the number 9.</p>

  <p>Algebraic formulas use the operators &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;. You can use parentheses to make
  the order of evaluation clear. In the absence of parentheses,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  evaluated first, then &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, then &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;, then finally
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;. For
  example, the expression</p>
  <pre class="example">
     2 + 3*4*5 / 6*7^8 - 9
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">is equivalent to</p>
  <pre class="example">
     2 + ((3*4*5) / (6*(7^8)) - 9
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">or, in large mathematical notation,</p>
  <pre class="example">
         3 * 4 * 5
     2 + --------- - 9
               8
          6 * 7
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The result of this expression will be the
  number <i>-6.99999826533</i>.</p>

  <p>Calc's order of evaluation is the same as for most computer
  languages, except that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; binds more strongly than
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;, as the
  above example shows. As in normal mathematical notation, the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol can
  often be omitted: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2
  a</span></samp>&rsquo; is the same as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2*a</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Operators at the same level are evaluated from left to right,
  except that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; is evaluated from right to left.
  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2-3-4</span></samp>&rsquo;
  is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(2-3)-4</span></samp>&rsquo; or <i>-5</i>, whereas
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2^3^4</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2^(3^4)</span></samp>&rsquo; (a very large integer; try
  it!).</p>

  <p>If you tire of typing the apostrophe all the time, there is
  Algebraic mode, where Calc automatically senses when you are
  about to type an algebraic expression. To enter this mode, press
  the two letters <kbd>m&nbsp;a</kbd><!-- /@w -->. (An
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Alg</span></samp>&rsquo;
  indicator should appear in the Calc window's mode line.)</p>

  <p>Press <kbd>m a</kbd>, then <kbd>2+3+4</kbd> with no
  apostrophe, then &lt;RET&gt;.</p>

  <p>In Algebraic mode, when you press any key that would normally
  begin entering a number (such as a digit, a decimal point, or the
  <kbd>_</kbd> key), or if you press <kbd>(</kbd> or <kbd>[</kbd>,
  Calc automatically begins an algebraic entry.</p>

  <p>Functions which do not have operator symbols like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; must be
  entered in formulas using function-call notation. For example,
  the function name corresponding to the square-root key
  <kbd>Q</kbd> is <code>sqrt</code>. To compute a square root in a
  formula, you would use the notation &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(</span><var>x</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Press the apostrophe, then type <kbd>sqrt(5*2) - 3</kbd>. The
  result should be &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">0.16227766017</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Note that if the formula begins with a function name, you need
  to use the apostrophe even if you are in Algebraic mode. If you
  type <kbd>arcsin</kbd> out of the blue, the <kbd>a r</kbd> will
  be taken as an Algebraic Rewrite command, and the <kbd>csin</kbd>
  will be taken as the name of the rewrite rule to use!</p>

  <p>Some people prefer to enter complex numbers and vectors in
  algebraic form because they find RPN entry with incomplete
  objects to be too distracting, even though they otherwise use
  Calc as an RPN calculator.</p>

  <p>Still in Algebraic mode, type:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  (2, 3)     2:  (2, 3)     1:  (8, -1)    2:  (8, -1)    1:  (9, -1)
         .          1:  (1, -2)        .          1:  1              .
                        .                             .

      (2,3) &lt;RET&gt;      (1,-2) &lt;RET&gt;        *              1 &lt;RET&gt;          +
</pre>

  <p>Algebraic mode allows us to enter complex numbers without
  pressing an apostrophe first, but it also means we need to press
  &lt;RET&gt; after every entry, even for a simple number like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>(You can type <kbd>C-u m a</kbd> to enable a special
  Incomplete Algebraic mode in which the <kbd>(</kbd> and
  <kbd>[</kbd> keys use algebraic entry even though regular numeric
  keys still use RPN numeric entry. There is also Total Algebraic
  mode, started by typing <kbd>m t</kbd>, in which all normal keys
  begin algebraic entry. You must then use the &lt;META&gt; key to
  type Calc commands: <kbd>M-m t</kbd> to get back out of Total
  Algebraic mode, <kbd>M-q</kbd> to quit, etc.)</p>

  <p>If you're still in Algebraic mode, press <kbd>m a</kbd> again
  to turn it off.</p>

  <p>Actual non-RPN calculators use a mixture of algebraic and RPN
  styles. In general, operators of two numbers (like <kbd>+</kbd>
  and <kbd>*</kbd>) use algebraic form, but operators of one number
  (like <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>Q</kbd>) use RPN form. Also, a
  non-RPN calculator allows you to see the intermediate results of
  a calculation as you go along. You can accomplish this in Calc by
  performing your calculation as a series of algebraic entries,
  using the <kbd>$</kbd> sign to tie them together. In an algebraic
  formula, <kbd>$</kbd> represents the number on the top of the
  stack. Here, we perform the calculation
  <!-- @math{\sqrt{2\times4+1}}, -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(2*4+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which on a traditional
  calculator would be done by pressing <kbd>2 * 4 + 1 =</kbd> and
  then the square-root key.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  8          1:  9          1:  3
         .              .              .

       ' 2*4 &lt;RET&gt;        $+1 &lt;RET&gt;        Q
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Notice that we didn't need to press an
  apostrophe for the <kbd>$+1</kbd>, because the dollar sign always
  begins an algebraic entry.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> How could you get the
  same effect as pressing <kbd>Q</kbd> but using an algebraic entry
  instead? How about if the <kbd>Q</kbd> key on your keyboard were
  broken? See <a href=
  "Algebraic-Answer-1.html#Algebraic-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>The notations <kbd>$$</kbd>, <kbd>$$$</kbd>, and so on stand
  for higher stack entries. For example, <kbd>' $$+$
  &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> is just like typing <kbd>+</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Algebraic formulas can include <dfn>variables</dfn>. To store
  in a variable, press <kbd>s s</kbd>, then type the variable name,
  then press &lt;RET&gt;. (There are actually two flavors of store
  command: <kbd>s s</kbd> stores a number in a variable but also
  leaves the number on the stack, while <kbd>s&nbsp;t</kbd>
  <!-- /@w --> removes a number from the stack and stores it in the
  variable.) A variable name should consist of one or more letters
  or digits, beginning with a letter.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  17             .          1:  a + a^2    1:  306
         .                             .              .

         17          s t a &lt;RET&gt;      ' a+a^2 &lt;RET&gt;       =
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The <kbd>=</kbd> key <dfn>evaluates</dfn> a
  formula by replacing all its variables by the values that were
  stored in them.</p>

  <p>For RPN calculations, you can recall a variable's value on the
  stack either by entering its name as a formula and pressing
  <kbd>=</kbd>, or by using the <kbd>s r</kbd> command.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  17         2:  17         3:  17         2:  17         1:  306
         .          1:  17         2:  17         1:  289            .
                        .          1:  2              .
                                       .

       s r a &lt;RET&gt;     ' a &lt;RET&gt; =         2              ^              +
</pre>

  <p>If you press a single digit for a variable name (as in <kbd>s
  t 3</kbd>, you get one of ten <dfn>quick variables</dfn>
  <code>q0</code> through <code>q9</code>. They are
  &ldquo;quick&rdquo; simply because you don't have to type the
  letter <code>q</code> or the &lt;RET&gt; after their names. In
  fact, you can type simply <kbd>s 3</kbd> as a shorthand for
  <kbd>s s 3</kbd>, and likewise for <kbd>t 3</kbd> and
  <kbd>r&nbsp;3</kbd><!-- /@w -->.</p>

  <p>Any variables in an algebraic formula for which you have not
  stored values are left alone, even when you evaluate the
  formula.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2 a + 2 b     1:  34 + 2 b
         .                 .

      ' 2a+2b &lt;RET&gt;          =
</pre>

  <p>Calls to function names which are undefined in Calc are also
  left alone, as are calls for which the value is undefined.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2 + log10(0) + log10(x) + log10(5, 6) + foo(3)
         .

      ' log10(100) + log10(0) + log10(x) + log10(5,6) + foo(3) &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">In this example, the first call to
  <code>log10</code> works, but the other calls are not evaluated.
  In the second call, the logarithm is undefined for that value of
  the argument; in the third, the argument is symbolic, and in the
  fourth, there are too many arguments. In the fifth case, there is
  no function called <code>foo</code>. You will see a &ldquo;Wrong
  number of arguments&rdquo; message referring to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">log10(5,6)</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  Press the <kbd>w</kbd> (&ldquo;why&rdquo;) key to see any other
  messages that may have arisen from the last calculation. In this
  case you will get &ldquo;logarithm of zero,&rdquo; then
  &ldquo;number expected: <code>x</code>&rdquo;. Calc automatically
  displays the first message only if the message is sufficiently
  important; for example, Calc considers &ldquo;wrong number of
  arguments&rdquo; and &ldquo;logarithm of zero&rdquo; to be
  important enough to report automatically, while a message like
  &ldquo;number expected: <code>x</code>&rdquo; will only show up
  if you explicitly press the <kbd>w</kbd> key.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Joe entered the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x y</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  stored 5 in <code>x</code>, pressed <kbd>=</kbd>, and got the
  expected result, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10
  y</span></samp>&rsquo;. He then tried the same for the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x (1+y)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  expecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10
  (1+y)</span></samp>&rsquo;, but it didn't work. Why not? See
  <a href="Algebraic-Answer-2.html#Algebraic-Answer-2">2</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> What result would you
  expect <kbd>1 &lt;RET&gt; 0 /</kbd> to give? What if you then
  type <kbd>0 *</kbd>? See <a href=
  "Algebraic-Answer-3.html#Algebraic-Answer-3">3</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>One interesting way to work with variables is to use the
  <dfn>evaluates-to</dfn> (&lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;) operator. It works like this:
  Enter a formula algebraically in the usual way, but follow the
  formula with an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol. (There is also an
  <kbd>s =</kbd> command which builds an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; formula using the stack.) On
  the stack, you will see two copies of the formula with an
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  between them. The lefthand formula is exactly like you typed it;
  the righthand formula has been evaluated as if by typing
  <kbd>=</kbd>.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  2 + 3 =&gt; 5                     2:  2 + 3 =&gt; 5
     1:  2 a + 2 b =&gt; 34 + 2 b          1:  2 a + 2 b =&gt; 20 + 2 b
         .                                  .

     ' 2+3 =&gt; &lt;RET&gt;  ' 2a+2b &lt;RET&gt; s =          10 s t a &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Notice that the instant we stored a new value
  in <code>a</code>, all &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operators already on the stack
  that referred to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; were updated to use the new value.
  With &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  you can push a set of formulas on the stack, then change the
  variables experimentally to see the effects on the formulas'
  values.</p>

  <p>You can also &ldquo;unstore&rdquo; a variable when you are
  through with it:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  2 + 5 =&gt; 5
     1:  2 a + 2 b =&gt; 2 a + 2 b
         .

         s u a &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p>We will encounter formulas involving variables and functions
  again when we discuss the algebra and calculus features of the
  Calculator.</p>
