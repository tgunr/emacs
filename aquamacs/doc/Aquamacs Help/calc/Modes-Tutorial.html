  <h4 class="subsection">3.1.4 Mode-Setting Commands</h4>

  <p class="noindent">Calc has many types of <dfn>modes</dfn> that
  affect the way it interprets your commands or the way it displays
  data. We have already seen one mode, namely Algebraic mode. There
  are many others, too; we'll try some of the most common ones
  here.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most fundamental mode in Calc is the current
  <dfn>precision</dfn>. Notice the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">12</span></samp>&rsquo; on the Calc window's mode
  line:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     --%*-Calc: 12 Deg       (Calculator)----All------
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Most of the symbols there are Emacs things
  you don't need to worry about, but the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">12</span></samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Deg</span></samp>&rsquo; are mode indicators. The
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12</span></samp>&rsquo; means
  that calculations should always be carried to 12 significant
  figures. That is why, when we type <kbd>1 &lt;RET&gt; 7 /</kbd>,
  we get &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">0.142857142857</span></samp>&rsquo; with exactly 12
  digits, not counting leading and trailing zeros.</p>

  <p>You can set the precision to anything you like by pressing
  <kbd>p</kbd>, then entering a suitable number. Try pressing
  <kbd>p 30 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, then doing <kbd>1 &lt;RET&gt; 7
  /</kbd> again:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  0.142857142857
     2:  0.142857142857142857142857142857
         .
</pre>

  <p>Although the precision can be set arbitrarily high, Calc
  always has to have <em>some</em> value for the current precision.
  After all, the true value &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1/7</span></samp>&rsquo; is an infinitely repeating
  decimal; Calc has to stop somewhere.</p>

  <p>Of course, calculations are slower the more digits you
  request. Press <kbd>p&nbsp;12</kbd><!-- /@w --> now to set the
  precision back down to the default.</p>

  <p>Calculations always use the current precision. For example,
  even though we have a 30-digit value for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/7</span></samp>&rsquo; on the
  stack, if we use it in a calculation in 12-digit mode it will be
  rounded down to 12 digits before it is used. Try it; press
  &lt;RET&gt; to duplicate the number, then <kbd>1&nbsp;+</kbd>
  <!-- /@w -->. Notice that the &lt;RET&gt; key didn't round the
  number, because it doesn't do any calculation. But the instant we
  pressed <kbd>+</kbd>, the number was rounded down.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  0.142857142857
     2:  0.142857142857142857142857142857
     3:  1.14285714286
         .
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">In fact, since we added a digit on the left,
  we had to lose one digit on the right from even the 12-digit
  value of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1/7</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>How did we get more than 12 digits when we computed
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2^3^4</span></samp>&rsquo;? The
  answer is that Calc makes a distinction between
  <dfn>integers</dfn> and <dfn>floating-point</dfn> numbers, or
  <dfn>floats</dfn>. An integer is a number that does not contain a
  decimal point. There is no such thing as an &ldquo;infinitely
  repeating fraction integer,&rdquo; so Calc doesn't have to limit
  itself. If you asked for &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2^10000</span></samp>&rsquo; (don't try this!), you would
  have to wait a long time but you would eventually get an exact
  answer. If you ask for &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2.^10000</span></samp>&rsquo;, you will quickly get an
  answer which is correct only to 12 places. The decimal point
  tells Calc that it should use floating-point arithmetic to get
  the answer, not exact integer arithmetic.</p>

  <p>You can use the <kbd>F</kbd> (<code>calc-floor</code>) command
  to convert a floating-point value to an integer, and <kbd>c
  f</kbd> (<code>calc-float</code>) to convert an integer to
  floating-point form.</p>

  <p>Let's try entering that last calculation:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2.         2:  2.         1:  1.99506311689e3010
         .          1:  10000          .
                        .

       2.0 &lt;RET&gt;          10000 &lt;RET&gt;      ^
</pre>

  <p class="noindent"><a name=
  "index-Scientific-notation_002c-entry-of-18" id=
  "index-Scientific-notation_002c-entry-of-18"></a>Notice the
  letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo; in
  there. It represents &ldquo;times ten to the power of,&rdquo; and
  is used by Calc automatically whenever writing the number out
  fully would introduce more extra zeros than you probably want to
  see. You can enter numbers in this notation, too.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2.         2:  2.         1:  1.99506311678e3010
         .          1:  10000.         .
                        .

       2.0 &lt;RET&gt;          1e4 &lt;RET&gt;        ^
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-Round_002doff-errors-19" id=
  "index-Round_002doff-errors-19"></a>Hey, the answer is different!
  Look closely at the middle columns of the two examples. In the
  first, the stack contained the exact integer
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10000</span></samp>&rsquo;, but
  in the second it contained a floating-point value with a decimal
  point. When you raise a number to an integer power, Calc uses
  repeated squaring and multiplication to get the answer. When you
  use a floating-point power, Calc uses logarithms and
  exponentials. As you can see, a slight error crept in during one
  of these methods. Which one should we trust? Let's raise the
  precision a bit and find out:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
         .          1:  2.         2:  2.         1:  1.995063116880828e3010
                        .          1:  10000.         .
                                       .

      p 16 &lt;RET&gt;        2. &lt;RET&gt;           1e4            ^    p 12 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-Guard-digits-20" id=
  "index-Guard-digits-20"></a>Presumably, it doesn't matter whether
  we do this higher-precision calculation using an integer or
  floating-point power, since we have added enough &ldquo;guard
  digits&rdquo; to trust the first 12 digits no matter what. And
  the verdict is<small class="dots">...</small> Integer powers were
  more accurate; in fact, the result was only off by one unit in
  the last place.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Guard-digits-21" id=
  "index-Guard-digits-21"></a>Calc does many of its internal
  calculations to a slightly higher precision, but it doesn't
  always bump the precision up enough. In each case, Calc added
  about two digits of precision during its calculation and then
  rounded back down to 12 digits afterward. In one case, it was
  enough; in the other, it wasn't. If you really need <var>x</var>
  digits of precision, it never hurts to do the calculation with a
  few extra guard digits.</p>

  <p>What if we want guard digits but don't want to look at them?
  We can set the <dfn>float format</dfn>. Calc supports four major
  formats for floating-point numbers, called <dfn>normal</dfn>,
  <dfn>fixed-point</dfn>, <dfn>scientific notation</dfn>, and
  <dfn>engineering notation</dfn>. You get them by pressing
  <kbd>d&nbsp;n</kbd><!-- /@w -->, <kbd>d f</kbd>, <kbd>d s</kbd>,
  and <kbd>d e</kbd>, respectively. In each case, you can supply a
  numeric prefix argument which says how many digits should be
  displayed. As an example, let's put a few numbers onto the stack
  and try some different display modes. First, use <kbd>M-0
  &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> to clear the stack, then enter the four numbers
  shown here:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     4:  12345      4:  12345      4:  12345      4:  12345      4:  12345
     3:  12345.     3:  12300.     3:  1.2345e4   3:  1.23e4     3:  12345.000
     2:  123.45     2:  123.       2:  1.2345e2   2:  1.23e2     2:  123.450
     1:  12.345     1:  12.3       1:  1.2345e1   1:  1.23e1     1:  12.345
         .              .              .              .              .

        d n          M-3 d n          d s          M-3 d s        M-3 d f
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Notice that when we typed <kbd>M-3 d n</kbd>,
  the numbers were rounded down to three significant digits, but
  then when we typed <kbd>d s</kbd> all five significant figures
  reappeared. The float format does not affect how numbers are
  stored, it only affects how they are displayed. Only the current
  precision governs the actual rounding of numbers in the
  Calculator's memory.</p>

  <p>Engineering notation, not shown here, is like scientific
  notation except the exponent (the power-of-ten part) is always
  adjusted to be a multiple of three (as in &ldquo;kilo,&rdquo;
  &ldquo;micro,&rdquo; etc.). As a result there will be one, two,
  or three digits before the decimal point.</p>

  <p>Whenever you change a display-related mode, Calc redraws
  everything in the stack. This may be slow if there are many
  things on the stack, so Calc allows you to type
  shift-<kbd>H</kbd> before any mode command to prevent it from
  updating the stack. Anything Calc displays after the
  mode-changing command will appear in the new format.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     4:  12345      4:  12345      4:  12345      4:  12345      4:  12345
     3:  12345.000  3:  12345.000  3:  12345.000  3:  1.2345e4   3:  12345.
     2:  123.450    2:  123.450    2:  1.2345e1   2:  1.2345e1   2:  123.45
     1:  12.345     1:  1.2345e1   1:  1.2345e2   1:  1.2345e2   1:  12.345
         .              .              .              .              .

         H d s          &lt;DEL&gt; U          &lt;TAB&gt;            d &lt;SPC&gt;          d n
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Here the <kbd>H d s</kbd> command changes to
  scientific notation but without updating the screen. Deleting the
  top stack entry and undoing it back causes it to show up in the
  new format; swapping the top two stack entries reformats both
  entries. The <kbd>d &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> command refreshes the whole
  stack. The <kbd>d n</kbd> command changes back to the normal
  float format; since it doesn't have an <kbd>H</kbd> prefix, it
  also updates all the stack entries to be in <kbd>d n</kbd>
  format.</p>

  <p>Notice that the integer &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">12345</span></samp>&rsquo; was not affected by any of the
  float formats. Integers are integers, and are always displayed
  exactly.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Large-numbers_002c-readability-22" id=
  "index-Large-numbers_002c-readability-22"></a>Large integers have
  their own problems. Let's look back at the result of
  <kbd>2^3^4</kbd>.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     2417851639229258349412352
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Quick&mdash;how many digits does this have?
  Try typing <kbd>d g</kbd>:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     2,417,851,639,229,258,349,412,352
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Now how many digits does this have? It's much
  easier to tell! We can actually group digits into clumps of any
  size. Some people prefer <kbd>M-5 d g</kbd>:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     24178,51639,22925,83494,12352
</pre>

  <p>Let's see what happens to floating-point numbers when they are
  grouped. First, type <kbd>p 25 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to make sure we
  have enough precision to get ourselves into trouble. Now, type
  <kbd>1e13 /</kbd>:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     24,17851,63922.9258349412352
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The integer part is grouped but the
  fractional part isn't. Now try <kbd>M-- M-5 d g</kbd> (that's
  meta-minus-sign, meta-five):</p>
  <pre class="example">
     24,17851,63922.92583,49412,352
</pre>

  <p>If you find it hard to tell the decimal point from the commas,
  try changing the grouping character to a space with <kbd>d ,
  &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     24 17851 63922.92583 49412 352
</pre>

  <p>Type <kbd>d , ,</kbd> to restore the normal grouping
  character, then <kbd>d g</kbd> again to turn grouping off. Also,
  press <kbd>p 12</kbd> to restore the default precision.</p>

  <p>Press <kbd>U</kbd> enough times to get the original big
  integer back. (Notice that <kbd>U</kbd> does not undo each
  mode-setting command; if you want to undo a mode-setting command,
  you have to do it yourself.) Now, type <kbd>d r 16
  &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     16#200000000000000000000
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The number is now displayed in
  <dfn>hexadecimal</dfn>, or &ldquo;base-16&rdquo; form. Suddenly
  it looks pretty simple; this should be no surprise, since we got
  this number by computing a power of two, and 16 is a power of 2.
  In fact, we can use <kbd>d&nbsp;r&nbsp;2&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
  <!-- /@w --> to see it in actual binary form:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     2#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ...
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">We don't have enough space here to show all
  the zeros! They won't fit on a typical screen, either, so you
  will have to use horizontal scrolling to see them all. Press
  <kbd>&lt;</kbd> and <kbd>&gt;</kbd> to scroll the stack window
  left and right by half its width. Another way to view something
  large is to press <kbd>`</kbd> (back-quote) to edit the top of
  stack in a separate window. (Press <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> when you
  are done.)</p>

  <p>You can enter non-decimal numbers using the <kbd>#</kbd>
  symbol, too. Let's see what the hexadecimal number
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5FE</span></samp>&rsquo; looks
  like in binary. Type <kbd>16#5FE</kbd> (the letters can be typed
  in upper or lower case; they will always appear in upper case).
  It will also help to turn grouping on with <kbd>d g</kbd>:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     2#101,1111,1110
</pre>

  <p>Notice that <kbd>d g</kbd> groups by fours by default if the
  display radix is binary or hexadecimal, but by threes if it is
  decimal, octal, or any other radix.</p>

  <p>Now let's see that number in decimal; type <kbd>d r
  10</kbd>:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     1,534
</pre>

  <p>Numbers are not <em>stored</em> with any particular radix
  attached. They're just numbers; they can be entered in any radix,
  and are always displayed in whatever radix you've chosen with
  <kbd>d r</kbd>. The current radix applies to integers, fractions,
  and floats.</p>

  <p><a name=

  "index-Roundoff-errors_002c-in-non_002ddecimal-numbers-23"></a>(&bull;)
  <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Your friend Joe tried to enter
  one-third as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">3#0.1</span></samp>&rsquo; in <kbd>d r 3</kbd> mode with a
  precision of 12. He got &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">3#0.0222222...</span></samp>&rsquo; (with 25 2's) in the
  display. When he multiplied that by three, he got
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">3#0.222222...</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of the expected
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3#1</span></samp>&rsquo;. Next,
  Joe entered &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">3#0.2</span></samp>&rsquo; and, to his great relief, saw
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3#0.2</span></samp>&rsquo; on the
  screen. But when he typed <kbd>2 /</kbd>, he got
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3#0.10000001</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (some zeros omitted). What's going on here? See <a href=
  "Modes-Answer-1.html#Modes-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-Scientific-notation_002c-in-non_002ddecimal-numbers-24"
  id="index-Scientific-notation_002c-in-non_002ddecimal-numbers-24">
  </a>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Scientific notation
  works in non-decimal modes in the natural way (the exponent is a
  power of the radix instead of a power of ten, although the
  exponent itself is always written in decimal). Thus
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8#1.23e3 =
  8#1230.0</span></samp>&rsquo;. Suppose we have the hexadecimal
  number &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f.e8f</span></samp>&rsquo;
  times 16 to the 15th power: We write &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">16#f.e8fe15</span></samp>&rsquo;. What is wrong with this
  picture? What could we write instead that would work better? See
  <a href="Modes-Answer-2.html#Modes-Answer-2">2</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>The <kbd>m</kbd> prefix key has another set of modes, relating
  to the way Calc interprets your inputs and does computations.
  Whereas <kbd>d</kbd>-prefix modes generally affect the way things
  look, <kbd>m</kbd>-prefix modes affect the way they are actually
  computed.</p>

  <p>The most popular <kbd>m</kbd>-prefix mode is the <dfn>angular
  mode</dfn>. Notice the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Deg</span></samp>&rsquo; indicator in the mode line. This
  means that if you use a command that interprets a number as an
  angle, it will assume the angle is measured in degrees. For
  example,</p>

  <p class="noindent">The shift-<kbd>S</kbd> command computes the
  sine of an angle. The sine of 45 degrees is
  <!-- @math{\sqrt{2}/2}; -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(2)/2</span></samp>&rsquo;;
  squaring this yields &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2/4 =
  0.5</span></samp>&rsquo;. However, there has been a slight
  roundoff error because the representation of
  <!-- @math{\sqrt{2}/2} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(2)/2</span></samp>&rsquo;
  wasn't exact. The <kbd>c 1</kbd> command is a handy way to clean
  up numbers in this case; it temporarily reduces the precision by
  one digit while it re-rounds the number on the top of the
  stack.</p>

  <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Your friend Joe computed the sine of
  45 degrees as shown above, then, hoping to avoid an inexact
  result, he increased the precision to 16 digits before squaring.

  <p>To do this calculation in radians, we would type <kbd>m
  r</kbd> first. (The indicator changes to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Rad</span></samp>&rsquo;.) 45
  degrees corresponds to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">pi/4</span></samp>&rsquo; radians. To get
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pi</span></samp>&rsquo;, press
  the <kbd>P</kbd> key. (Once again, this is a shifted capital
  <kbd>P</kbd>. Remember, unshifted <kbd>p</kbd> sets the
  precision.)</p>

  <p>Another interesting mode is <dfn>Fraction mode</dfn>.
  Normally, dividing two integers produces a floating-point result
  if the quotient can't be expressed as an exact integer. Fraction
  mode causes integer division to produce a fraction, i.e., a
  rational number, instead.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  12         1:  1.33333333333    1:  4:3
     1:  9              .                    .

  <p class="noindent">In the first case, we get an approximate
  floating-point result. In the second case, we get an exact
  fractional result (four-thirds).</p>

  <p>You can enter a fraction at any time using <kbd>:</kbd>
  notation. (Calc uses <kbd>:</kbd> instead of <kbd>/</kbd> as the
  fraction separator because <kbd>/</kbd> is already used to divide
  the top two stack elements.) Calculations involving fractions
  will always produce exact fractional results; Fraction mode only
  says what to do when dividing two integers.</p>

  4.</strong> If fractional arithmetic is exact, why would you ever
  use floating-point numbers instead? See <a href=
  "Modes-Answer-4.html#Modes-Answer-4">4</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>Typing <kbd>m f</kbd> doesn't change any existing values in
  the stack. In the above example, we had to Undo the division and
  do it over again when we changed to Fraction mode. But if you use
  the evaluates-to operator you can get commands like <kbd>m
  f</kbd> to recompute for you.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  12 / 9 =&gt; 1.33333333333    1:  12 / 9 =&gt; 1.333    1:  12 / 9 =&gt; 4:3
         .                              .                      .

</pre>

  <p class="noindent">In this example, the righthand side of the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operator on the stack is recomputed when we change the precision,
  then again when we change to Fraction mode. All
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  expressions on the stack are recomputed every time you change any
  mode that might affect their values.</p>
