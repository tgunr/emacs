  <h4 class="subsection">4.11.4 Debugging Calc</h4>

  <p class="noindent">A few commands exist to help in the debugging
  of Calc commands. See <a href=
  "Programming.html#Programming">Programming</a>, to see the
  various ways that you can write your own Calc commands.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Z-T-234" id="index-Z-T-234"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dtiming-235" id=
  "index-calc_002dtiming-235"></a>The <kbd>Z T</kbd>
  (<code>calc-timing</code>) command turns on and off a mode in
  which the timing of slow commands is reported in the Trail. Any
  Calc command that takes two seconds or longer writes a line to
  the Trail showing how many seconds it took. This value is
  accurate only to within one second.</p>

  <p>All steps of executing a command are included; in particular,
  time taken to format the result for display in the stack and
  trail is counted. Some prompts also count time taken waiting for
  them to be answered, while others do not; this depends on the
  exact implementation of the command. For best results, if you are
  timing a sequence that includes prompts or multiple commands,
  define a keyboard macro to run the whole sequence at once. Calc's
  <kbd>X</kbd> command (see <a href=
  "Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>) will
  then report the time taken to execute the whole macro.</p>

  <p>Another advantage of the <kbd>X</kbd> command is that while it
  is executing, the stack and trail are not updated from step to
  step. So if you expect the output of your test sequence to leave
  a result that may take a long time to format and you don't wish
  to count this formatting time, end your sequence with a
  &lt;DEL&gt; keystroke to clear the result from the stack. When
  you run the sequence with <kbd>X</kbd>, Calc will never bother to
  format the large result.</p>

  <p>Another thing <kbd>Z T</kbd> does is to increase the Emacs
  variable <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> to a much higher value
  (two million; the usual default in Calc is 250,000) for the
  duration of each command. This generally prevents garbage
  collection during the timing of the command, though it may cause
  your Emacs process to grow abnormally large. (Garbage collection
  time is a major unpredictable factor in the timing of Emacs
  operations.)</p>

  <p>Another command that is useful when debugging your own Lisp
  extensions to Calc is <kbd>M-x calc-pass-errors</kbd>, which
  disables the error handler that changes the
  &ldquo;<code>max-lisp-eval-depth</code> exceeded&rdquo; message
  to the much more friendly &ldquo;Computation got stuck or ran too
  long.&rdquo; This handler interferes with the Emacs Lisp
  debugger's <code>debug-on-error</code> mode. Errors are reported
  in the handler itself rather than at the true location of the
  error. After you have executed <code>calc-pass-errors</code>,
  Lisp errors will be reported correctly but the user-friendly
  message will be lost.</p>
