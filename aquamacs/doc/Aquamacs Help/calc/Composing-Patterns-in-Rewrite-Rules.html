  <h4 class="subsection">11.11.6 Composing Patterns in Rewrite
  Rules</h4>

  <p class="noindent">There are three operators,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&amp;&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!!</span></samp>&rsquo;, that
  combine rewrite patterns to make larger patterns. The
  combinations are &ldquo;and,&rdquo; &ldquo;or,&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;not,&rdquo; respectively, and these operators are the
  pattern equivalents of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">||</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; (which operate on zero-or-nonzero
  logical values).</p>

  <p>Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&amp;&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!!</span></samp>&rsquo; are left
  in symbolic form by all regular Calc features; they have special
  meaning only in the context of rewrite rule patterns.</p>

  <p>The pattern &lsquo;<samp><var>p1</var> <span class=
  "samp">&amp;&amp;&amp;</span> <var>p2</var></samp>&rsquo; matches
  anything that matches both <var>p1</var> and <var>p2</var>. One
  especially useful case is when one of <var>p1</var> or
  <var>p2</var> is a meta-variable. For example, here is a rule
  that operates on error forms:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(x &amp;&amp;&amp; a +/- b, x)  :=  g(x)
</pre>

  <p>This does the same thing, but is arguably simpler than, the
  rule</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(a +/- b, a +/- b)  :=  g(a +/- b)
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-ends-1936" id="index-ends-1936"></a>Here's
  another interesting example:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     ends(cons(a, x) &amp;&amp;&amp; rcons(y, b))  :=  [a, b]
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">which effectively clips out the middle of a
  vector leaving just the first and last elements. This rule will
  change a one-element vector &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[a]</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[a, a]</span></samp>&rsquo;. The similar rule</p>
  <pre class="example">
     ends(cons(a, rcons(y, b)))  :=  [a, b]
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">would do the same thing except that it would
  fail to match a one-element vector.</p>

  <p>The pattern &lsquo;<samp><var>p1</var> <span class=
  "samp">|||</span> <var>p2</var></samp>&rsquo; matches anything
  that matches either <var>p1</var> or <var>p2</var>. Calc first
  tries matching against <var>p1</var>; if that fails, it goes on
  to try <var>p2</var>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-curve-1937" id="index-curve-1937"></a>A simple
  example of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo; is</p>
  <pre class="example">
     curve(inf ||| -inf)  :=  0
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">which converts both &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">curve(inf)</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">curve(-inf)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  to zero.</p>

  <p>Here is a larger example:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     log(a, b) ||| (ln(a) :: let(b := e))  :=  mylog(a, b)
</pre>

  <p>This matches both generalized and natural logarithms in a
  single rule. Note that the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; term must be enclosed in
  parentheses because that operator has lower precedence than
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>(In practice this rule would probably include a third
  alternative, omitted here for brevity, to take care of
  <code>log10</code>.)</p>

  <p>While Calc generally treats interior conditions exactly the
  same as conditions on the outside of a rule, it does guarantee
  that if all the variables in the condition are special names like
  <code>e</code>, or already bound in the pattern to which the
  condition is attached (say, if &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; had appeared in this condition),
  then Calc will process this condition right after matching the
  pattern to the left of the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo;. Thus, we know that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; will be
  bound to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo;
  only if the <code>ln</code> branch of the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo; was
  taken.</p>

  <p>Note that this rule was careful to bind the same set of
  meta-variables on both sides of the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo;. Calc does not check this, but if
  you bind a certain meta-variable only in one branch and then use
  that meta-variable elsewhere in the rule, results are
  unpredictable:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(a,b) ||| g(b)  :=  h(a,b)
</pre>

  <p>Here if the pattern matches &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">g(17)</span></samp>&rsquo;, Calc makes no promises about
  the value that will be substituted for &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; on the righthand side.</p>

  <p>The pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!!</span>
  <var>pat</var></samp>&rsquo; matches anything that does not match
  <var>pat</var>. Any meta-variables that are bound while matching
  <var>pat</var> remain unbound outside of <var>pat</var>.</p>

  <p>For example,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(x &amp;&amp;&amp; !!! a +/- b, !!![])  :=  g(x)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">converts <code>f</code> whose first argument
  is anything <em>except</em> an error form, and whose second
  argument is not the empty vector, into a similar call to
  <code>g</code> (but without the second argument).</p>

  <p>If we know that the second argument will be a vector (empty or
  not), then an equivalent rule would be:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(x, y)  :=  g(x)  :: typeof(x) != 7 :: vlen(y) &gt; 0
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">where of course 7 is the <code>typeof</code>
  code for error forms. Another final condition, that works for any
  kind of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  would be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!istrue(y ==
  [])</span></samp>&rsquo;. (The <code>istrue</code> function
  returns an explicit 0 if its argument was left in symbolic form;
  plain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!(y ==
  [])</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y !=
  []</span></samp>&rsquo; would not work to replace
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!![]</span></samp>&rsquo; since
  these would be left unsimplified, and thus cause the rule to
  fail, if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;
  was something like a variable name.)</p>

  <p>It is possible for a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">!!!</span></samp>&rsquo; to refer to meta-variables bound
  elsewhere in the pattern. For example,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(a, !!!a)  :=  g(a)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">matches any call to <code>f</code> with
  different arguments, changing this to <code>g</code> with only
  the first argument.</p>

  <p>If a function call is to be matched and one of the argument
  patterns contains a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">!!!</span></samp>&rsquo; somewhere inside it, that
  argument will be matched last. Thus</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(!!!a, a)  :=  g(a)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">will be careful to bind
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; to the
  second argument of <code>f</code> before testing the first
  argument. If Calc had tried to match the first argument of
  <code>f</code> first, the results would have been disastrous:
  since <code>a</code> was unbound so far, the pattern
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; would have
  matched anything at all, and the pattern
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!!a</span></samp>&rsquo;
  therefore would <em>not</em> have matched anything at all!</p>
