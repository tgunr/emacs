  <h4 class="subsection">11.5.3 Customizing the Integrator</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-IntegRules-1746" id=
  "index-IntegRules-1746"></a>Calc has two built-in rewrite rules
  called <code>IntegRules</code> and <code>IntegAfterRules</code>
  which you can edit to define new integration methods. See
  <a href="Rewrite-Rules.html#Rewrite-Rules">Rewrite Rules</a>. At
  each step of the integration process, Calc wraps the current
  integrand in a call to the fictitious function
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">integtry(</span><var>expr</var><span class=
  "samp">,</span><var>var</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>expr</var> is the
  integrand and <var>var</var> is the integration variable. If your
  rules rewrite this to be a plain formula (not a call to
  <code>integtry</code>), then Calc will use this formula as the
  integral of <var>expr</var>. For example, the rule
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">integtry(mysin(x),x) :=
  -mycos(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; would define a rule to integrate a
  function <code>mysin</code> that acts like the sine function.
  Then, putting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4
  mysin(2y+1)</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack and typing <kbd>a i
  y</kbd> will produce the integral &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-2 mycos(2y+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Note that Calc has
  automatically made various transformations on the integral to
  allow it to use your rule; integral tables generally give rules
  for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mysin(a x +
  b)</span></samp>&rsquo;, but you don't need to use this much
  generality in your <code>IntegRules</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Exponential-integral-Ei_0028x_0029-1747" id=
  "index-Exponential-integral-Ei_0028x_0029-1747"></a><a name=
  "index-Ei-1748" id="index-Ei-1748"></a>As a more serious example,
  the expression &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">exp(x)/x</span></samp>&rsquo; cannot be integrated in
  terms of the standard functions, so the &ldquo;exponential
  integral&rdquo; function <!-- @math{{\rm Ei}(x)} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ei(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; was
  invented to describe it. We can get Calc to do this integral in
  terms of a made-up <code>Ei</code> function by adding the rule
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[integtry(exp(x)/x, x) :=
  Ei(x)]</span></samp>&rsquo; to <code>IntegRules</code>. Now
  entering &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">exp(2x)/x</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack and typing
  <kbd>a i x</kbd> yields &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ei(2
  x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. This new rule will work with Calc's
  various built-in integration methods (such as integration by
  substitution) to solve a variety of other problems involving
  <code>Ei</code>: For example, now Calc will also be able to
  integrate &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">exp(exp(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(ln(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (to get &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Ei(exp(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x ln(ln(x)) -
  Ei(ln(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively).</p>

  <p>Your rule may do further integration by calling
  <code>integ</code>. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">integtry(twice(u),x) :=
  twice(integ(u))</span></samp>&rsquo; allows Calc to integrate
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">twice(sin(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; to get
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">twice(-cos(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;. Note that
  <code>integ</code> was called with only one argument. This
  notation is allowed only within <code>IntegRules</code>; it means
  &ldquo;integrate this with respect to the same integration
  variable.&rdquo; If Calc is unable to integrate <code>u</code>,
  the integration that invoked <code>IntegRules</code> also fails.
  Thus integrating &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">twice(f(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; fails, returning the
  unevaluated integral &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">integ(twice(f(x)), x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. It is still
  valid to call <code>integ</code> with two or more arguments,
  however; in this case, if <code>u</code> is not integrable,
  <code>twice</code> itself will still be integrated: If the above
  rule is changed to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">... :=
  twice(integ(u,x))</span></samp>&rsquo;, then integrating
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">twice(f(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;
  will yield &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">twice(integ(f(x),x))</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If a rule instead produces the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">integsubst(</span><var>sexpr</var><span class=
  "samp">,</span> <var>svar</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, either replacing the top-level
  <code>integtry</code> call or nested anywhere inside the
  expression, then Calc will apply the substitution
  &lsquo;<samp><var>u</var> <span class="samp">=</span>
  <var>sexpr</var><span class=
  "samp">(</span><var>svar</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; to try to integrate the original
  <var>expr</var>. For example, the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(a) := integsubst(sqrt(x),x)</span></samp>&rsquo; says
  that if Calc ever finds a square root in the integrand, it should
  attempt the substitution &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u =
  sqrt(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. (This particular rule is
  unnecessary because Calc always tries &ldquo;obvious&rdquo;
  substitutions where <var>sexpr</var> actually appears in the
  integrand.) The variable <var>svar</var> may be the same as the
  <var>var</var> that appeared in the call to
  <code>integtry</code>, but it need not be.</p>

  <p>When integrating according to an <code>integsubst</code>, Calc
  uses the equation solver to find the inverse of <var>sexpr</var>
  (if the integrand refers to <var>var</var> anywhere except in
  subexpressions that exactly match <var>sexpr</var>). It uses the
  differentiator to find the derivative of <var>sexpr</var> and/or
  its inverse (it has two methods that use one derivative or the
  other). You can also specify these items by adding extra
  arguments to the <code>integsubst</code> your rules construct;
  the general form is &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">integsubst(</span><var>sexpr</var><span class=
  "samp">,</span> <var>svar</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>sinv</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>sprime</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where
  <var>sinv</var> is the inverse of <var>sexpr</var> (still written
  as a function of <var>svar</var>), and <var>sprime</var> is the
  derivative of <var>sexpr</var> with respect to <var>svar</var>.
  If you don't specify these things, and Calc is not able to work
  them out on its own with the information it knows, then your
  substitution rule will work only in very specific, simple
  cases.</p>

  <p>Calc applies <code>IntegRules</code> as if by <kbd>C-u 1 a r
  IntegRules</kbd>; in other words, Calc stops rewriting as soon as
  any rule in your rule set succeeds. (If it weren't for this, the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">integsubst(sqrt(x),x)</span></samp>&rsquo; example above
  would keep on adding layers of <code>integsubst</code> calls
  forever!)</p>

  <p><a name="index-IntegSimpRules-1749" id=
  "index-IntegSimpRules-1749"></a>Another set of rules, stored in
  <code>IntegSimpRules</code>, are applied every time the
  integrator uses <kbd>a s</kbd> to simplify an intermediate
  result. For example, putting the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">twice(x) := 2 x</span></samp>&rsquo; into
  <code>IntegSimpRules</code> would tell Calc to convert the
  <code>twice</code> function into a form it knows whenever
  integration is attempted.</p>

  <p>One more way to influence the integrator is to define a
  function with the <kbd>Z F</kbd> command (see <a href=
  "Algebraic-Definitions.html#Algebraic-Definitions">Algebraic
  Definitions</a>). Calc's integrator automatically expands such
  functions according to their defining formulas, even if you
  originally asked for the function to be left unevaluated for
  symbolic arguments. (Certain other Calc systems, such as the
  differentiator and the equation solver, also do this.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-IntegAfterRules-1750" id=
  "index-IntegAfterRules-1750"></a>Sometimes Calc is able to find a
  solution to your integral, but it expresses the result in a way
  that is unnecessarily complicated. If this happens, you can
  either use <code>integsubst</code> as described above to try to
  hint at a more direct path to the desired result, or you can use
  <code>IntegAfterRules</code>. This is an extra rule set that runs
  after the main integrator returns its result; basically, Calc
  does an <kbd>a r IntegAfterRules</kbd> on the result before
  showing it to you. (It also does an <kbd>a s</kbd>, without
  <code>IntegSimpRules</code>, after that to further simplify the
  result.) For example, Calc's integrator sometimes produces
  expressions of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(1+x) -
  ln(1-x)</span></samp>&rsquo;; the default
  <code>IntegAfterRules</code> rewrite this into the more readable
  form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2
  arctanh(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Note that, unlike
  <code>IntegRules</code>, <code>IntegSimpRules</code> and
  <code>IntegAfterRules</code> are applied any number of times
  until no further changes are possible. Rewriting by
  <code>IntegAfterRules</code> occurs only after the main
  integrator has finished, not at every step as for
  <code>IntegRules</code> and <code>IntegSimpRules</code>.</p>
