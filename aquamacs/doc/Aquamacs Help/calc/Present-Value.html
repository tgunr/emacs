  <h4 class="subsection">8.6.3 Present Value</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-b-P-878" id=
  "index-b-P-878"></a><a name="index-calc_002dfin_002dpv-879" id=
  "index-calc_002dfin_002dpv-879"></a><a name="index-pv-880" id=
  "index-pv-880"></a>The <kbd>b P</kbd> (<code>calc-fin-pv</code>)
  [<code>pv</code>] command computes the present value of an
  investment. Like <code>fv</code>, it takes three arguments:
  <code>pv(</code><var>rate</var><code>,</code>
  <var>n</var><code>,</code> <var>payment</var><code>)</code>. It
  computes the present value of a series of regular payments.
  Suppose you have the chance to make an investment that will pay
  $2000 per year over the next four years; as you receive these
  payments you can put them in the bank at 9% interest. You want to
  know whether it is better to make the investment, or to keep the
  money in the bank where it earns 9% interest right from the
  start. The calculation <code>pv(9%, 4, 2000)</code> gives the
  result 6479.44. If your initial investment must be less than
  this, say, $6000, then the investment is worthwhile. But if you
  had to put up $7000, then it would be better just to leave it in
  the bank.</p>

  <p>Here is the interpretation of the result of <code>pv</code>:
  You are trying to compare the return from the investment you are
  considering, which is <code>fv(9%, 4, 2000) = 9146.26</code>,
  with the return from leaving the money in the bank, which is
  <code>fvl(9%, 4,</code> <var>x</var><code>)</code> where
  <var>x</var> is the amount of money you would have to put up in
  advance. The <code>pv</code> function finds the break-even point,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x = 6479.44</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  at which <code>fvl(9%, 4, 6479.44)</code> is also equal to
  9146.26. This is the largest amount you should be willing to
  invest.</p>

  <p><a name="index-I-b-P-881" id="index-I-b-P-881"></a><a name=
  "index-pvb-882" id="index-pvb-882"></a>The <kbd>I b P</kbd>
  [<code>pvb</code>] command solves the same problem, but with
  payments occurring at the beginning of each interval. It has the
  same relationship to <code>fvb</code> as <code>pv</code> has to
  <code>fv</code>. For example <code>pvb(9%, 4, 2000) =
  7062.59</code>, a larger number than <code>pv</code> produced
  because we get to start earning interest on the return from our
  investment sooner.</p>

  <p><a name="index-H-b-P-883" id="index-H-b-P-883"></a><a name=
  "index-pvl-884" id="index-pvl-884"></a>The <kbd>H b P</kbd>
  [<code>pvl</code>] command computes the present value of an
  investment that will pay off in one lump sum at the end of the
  period. For example, if we get our $8000 all at the end of the
  four years, <code>pvl(9%, 4, 8000) = 5667.40</code>. This is much
  less than <code>pv</code> reported, because we don't earn any
  interest on the return from this investment. Note that
  <code>pvl</code> and <code>fvl</code> are simple inverses:
  <code>fvl(9%, 4, 5667.40) = 8000</code>.</p>

  <p>You can give an optional fourth lump-sum argument to
  <code>pv</code> and <code>pvb</code>; this is handled in exactly
  the same way as the fourth argument for <code>fv</code> and
  <code>fvb</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-b-N-885" id="index-b-N-885"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dfin_002dnpv-886" id=
  "index-calc_002dfin_002dnpv-886"></a><a name="index-npv-887" id=
  "index-npv-887"></a>The <kbd>b N</kbd>
  (<code>calc-fin-npv</code>) [<code>npv</code>] command computes
  the net present value of a series of irregular investments. The
  first argument is the interest rate. The second argument is a
  vector which represents the expected return from the investment
  at the end of each interval. For example, if the rate represents
  a yearly interest rate, then the vector elements are the return
  from the first year, second year, and so on.</p>

  <p>Thus, <code>npv(9%, [2000,2000,2000,2000]) = pv(9%, 4, 2000) =
  6479.44</code>. Obviously this function is more interesting when
  the payments are not all the same!</p>

  <p>The <code>npv</code> function can actually have two or more
  arguments. Multiple arguments are interpreted in the same way as
  for the vector statistical functions like <code>vsum</code>. See
  <a href=
  "Single_002dVariable-Statistics.html#Single_002dVariable-Statistics">
  Single-Variable Statistics</a>. Basically, if there are several
  payment arguments, each either a vector or a plain number, all
  these values are collected left-to-right into the complete list
  of payments. A numeric prefix argument on the <kbd>b N</kbd>
  command says how many payment values or vectors to take from the
  stack.</p>

  "index-npvb-889" id="index-npvb-889"></a>The <kbd>I b N</kbd>
  [<code>npvb</code>] command computes the net present value where
  payments occur at the beginning of each interval rather than at
  the end.</p>
