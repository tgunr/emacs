  <h4 class="subsection">7.6.2 Kinds of Declarations</h4>

  <p class="noindent">The type-specifier part of a declaration
  (that is, the second prompt in the <kbd>s d</kbd> command) can be
  a type symbol, an interval, or a vector consisting of zero or
  more type symbols followed by zero or more intervals or numbers
  that represent the set of possible values for the variable.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     [ [ a, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ]
       [ b, [1 .. 5]        ]
       [ c, [int, 1 .. 5]   ] ]
</pre>

  <p>Here <code>a</code> is declared to contain one of the five
  integers shown; <code>b</code> is any number in the interval from
  1 to 5 (any real number since we haven't specified), and
  <code>c</code> is any integer in that interval. Thus the
  declarations for <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> are nearly
  equivalent (see below).</p>

  <p>The type-specifier can be the empty vector
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo; to say
  that nothing is known about a given variable's value. This is the
  same as not declaring the variable at all except that it
  overrides any <code>All</code> declaration which would otherwise
  apply.</p>

  <p>The initial value of <code>Decls</code> is the empty vector
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo;. If
  <code>Decls</code> has no stored value or if the value stored in
  it is not valid, it is ignored and there are no declarations as
  far as Calc is concerned. (The <kbd>s d</kbd> command will
  replace such a malformed value with a fresh empty matrix,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo;, before
  recording the new declaration.) Unrecognized type symbols are
  ignored.</p>

  <p>The following type symbols describe what sorts of numbers will
  be stored in a variable:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>int</code></dt>

    <dd>Integers.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>numint</code></dt>

    <dd>Numerical integers. (Integers or integer-valued
    floats.)<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>frac</code></dt>

    <dd>Fractions. (Rational numbers which are not
    integers.)<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>rat</code></dt>

    <dd>Rational numbers. (Either integers or
    fractions.)<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>float</code></dt>

    <dd>Floating-point numbers.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>real</code></dt>

    <dd>Real numbers. (Integers, fractions, or floats. Actually,
    intervals and error forms with real components also count as
    reals here.)<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>pos</code></dt>

    <dd>Positive real numbers. (Strictly greater than
    zero.)<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>nonneg</code></dt>

    <dd>Nonnegative real numbers. (Greater than or equal to
    zero.)<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>number</code></dt>

    <dd>Numbers. (Real or complex.)</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Calc uses this information to determine when certain
  simplifications of formulas are safe. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x^y)^z</span></samp>&rsquo;
  cannot be simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^(y
  z)</span></samp>&rsquo; in general; for example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">((-3)^2)^1:2</span></samp>&rsquo;
  is 3, but &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(-3)^(2*1:2) =
  (-3)^1</span></samp>&rsquo; is <i>-3</i>. However, this
  simplification <em>is</em> safe if <code>z</code> is known to be
  an integer, or if <code>x</code> is known to be a nonnegative
  real number. If you have given declarations that allow Calc to
  deduce either of these facts, Calc will perform this
  simplification of the formula.</p>

  <p>Calc can apply a certain amount of logic when using
  declarations. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(x^y)^(2n+1)</span></samp>&rsquo; will be simplified if
  <code>n</code> has been declared <code>int</code>; Calc knows
  that an integer times an integer, plus an integer, must always be
  an integer. (In fact, Calc would simplify
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(-x)^(2n+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-(x^(2n+1))</span></samp>&rsquo; since it is able to
  determine that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2n+1</span></samp>&rsquo; must be an odd integer.)</p>

  <p>Similarly, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(abs(x)^y)^z</span></samp>&rsquo; will be simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">abs(x)^(y z)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  because Calc knows that the <code>abs</code> function always
  returns a nonnegative real. If you had a <code>myabs</code>
  function that also had this property, you could get Calc to
  recognize it by adding the row &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[myabs(), nonneg]</span></samp>&rsquo; to the
  <code>Decls</code> matrix.</p>

  <p>One instance of this simplification is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (since the <code>sqrt</code> function is effectively a one-half
  power). Normally Calc leaves this formula alone. After the
  command <kbd>s d x &lt;RET&gt; real &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, however,
  it can simplify the formula to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">abs(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. And after <kbd>s d x
  &lt;RET&gt; nonneg &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, Calc can simplify this
  formula all the way to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If there are any intervals or real numbers in the type
  specifier, they comprise the set of possible values that the
  variable or function being declared can have. In particular, the
  type symbol <code>real</code> is effectively the same as the
  range &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[-inf ..
  inf]</span></samp>&rsquo; (note that infinity is included in the
  range of possible values); <code>pos</code> is the same as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(0 .. inf]</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  and <code>nonneg</code> is the same as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[0 .. inf]</span></samp>&rsquo;. Saying
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[real, [-5 ..
  5]]</span></samp>&rsquo; is redundant because the fact that the
  variable is real can be deduced just from the interval, but
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[int, [-5 ..
  5]]</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[rat, [-5 .. 5]]</span></samp>&rsquo; are useful
  combinations.</p>

  <p>Note that the vector of intervals or numbers is in the same
  format used by Calc's set-manipulation commands. See <a href=
  "Set-Operations.html#Set-Operations">Set Operations</a>.</p>

  <p>The type specifier &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1, 2,
  3]</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[numint, 1, 2,
  3]</span></samp>&rsquo;, <em>not</em> to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[int, 1, 2,
  3]</span></samp>&rsquo;. In other words, the range of possible
  values means only that the variable's value must be numerically
  equal to a number in that range, but not that it must be equal in
  type as well. Calc's set operations act the same way;
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">in(2, [1., 2.,
  3.])</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">in(1.5, [1:2, 3:2, 5:2])</span></samp>&rsquo; both report
  &ldquo;true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If you use a conflicting combination of type specifiers, the
  results are unpredictable. An example is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[pos, [0 ..
  5]]</span></samp>&rsquo;, where the interval does not lie in the
  range described by the type symbol.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Real&rdquo; declarations mostly affect simplifications
  involving powers like the one described above. Another case where
  they are used is in the <kbd>a P</kbd> command which returns a
  list of all roots of a polynomial; if the variable has been
  declared real, only the real roots (if any) will be included in
  the list.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Integer&rdquo; declarations are used for
  simplifications which are valid only when certain values are
  integers (such as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(x^y)^z</span></samp>&rsquo; shown above).</p>

  <p>Another command that makes use of declarations is <kbd>a
  s</kbd>, when simplifying equations and inequalities. It will
  cancel <code>x</code> from both sides of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x = b x</span></samp>&rsquo;
  only if it is sure <code>x</code> is non-zero, say, because it
  has a <code>pos</code> declaration. To declare specifically that
  <code>x</code> is real and non-zero, use
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[-inf .. 0), (0 ..
  inf]]</span></samp>&rsquo;. (There is no way in the current
  notation to say that <code>x</code> is nonzero but not
  necessarily real.) The <kbd>a e</kbd> command does
  &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; simplifications, including cancelling
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; from the
  equation when &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is not known to be nonzero.</p>

  <p>Another set of type symbols distinguish between scalars and
  vectors.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>scalar</code></dt>

    <dd>The value is not a vector.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>vector</code></dt>

    <dd>The value is a vector.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>matrix</code></dt>

    <dd>The value is a matrix (a rectangular vector of
    vectors).<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>sqmatrix</code></dt>

    <dd>The value is a square matrix.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>These type symbols can be combined with the other type symbols
  described above; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[int,
  matrix]</span></samp>&rsquo; describes an object which is a
  matrix of integers.</p>

  <p>Scalar/vector declarations are used to determine whether
  certain algebraic operations are safe. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a, b, c] +
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; is normally not simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a + x, b + x, c +
  x]</span></samp>&rsquo;, but it will be if <code>x</code> has
  been declared <code>scalar</code>. On the other hand,
  multiplication is usually assumed to be commutative, but the
  terms in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x y</span></samp>&rsquo;
  will never be exchanged if both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
  are known to be vectors or matrices. (Calc currently never
  distinguishes between <code>vector</code> and <code>matrix</code>
  declarations.)</p>

  <p>See <a href="Matrix-Mode.html#Matrix-Mode">Matrix Mode</a>,
  for a discussion of Matrix mode and Scalar mode, which are
  similar to declaring &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[All,
  matrix]</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[All, scalar]</span></samp>&rsquo; but much more
  convenient.</p>

  <p>One more type symbol that is recognized is used with the
  <kbd>H a d</kbd> command for taking total derivatives of a
  formula. See <a href="Calculus.html#Calculus">Calculus</a>.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>const</code></dt>

    <dd>The value is a constant with respect to other
    variables.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Calc does not check the declarations for a variable when you
  store a value in it. However, storing <i>-3.5</i> in a variable
  that has been declared <code>pos</code>, <code>int</code>, or
  <code>matrix</code> may have unexpected effects; Calc may
  evaluate &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3.5</span></samp>&rsquo; if it
  substitutes the value first, or to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-3.5</span></samp>&rsquo; if <code>x</code> was declared
  <code>pos</code> and the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; before the
  value is substituted. Before using a variable for a new purpose,
  it is best to use <kbd>s d</kbd> or <kbd>s D</kbd> to check to
  make sure you don't still have an old declaration for the
  variable that will conflict with its new meaning.</p>
