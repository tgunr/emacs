  <h3 class="section">15.5 Grabbing from Other Buffers</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-g-2207" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-g-2207"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgrab_002dregion-2208" id=
  "index-calc_002dgrab_002dregion-2208"></a>The <kbd>C-x * g</kbd>
  (<code>calc-grab-region</code>) command takes the text between
  point and mark in the current buffer and attempts to parse it as
  a vector of values. Basically, it wraps the text in vector
  brackets &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ ]</span></samp>&rsquo;
  unless the text already is enclosed in vector brackets, then
  reads the text as if it were an algebraic entry. The contents of
  the vector may be numbers, formulas, or any other Calc objects.
  If the <kbd>C-x * g</kbd> command works successfully, it does an
  automatic <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> to enter the Calculator buffer.</p>

  <p>A numeric prefix argument grabs the specified number of lines
  around point, ignoring the mark. A positive prefix grabs from
  point to the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;th following newline (so that
  <kbd>M-1 C-x * g</kbd> grabs from point to the end of the current
  line); a negative prefix grabs from point back to the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n+1</span></samp>&rsquo;st
  preceding newline. In these cases the text that is grabbed is
  exactly the same as the text that <kbd>C-k</kbd> would delete
  given that prefix argument.</p>

  <p>A prefix of zero grabs the current line; point may be anywhere
  on the line.</p>

  <p>A plain <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix interprets the region between
  point and mark as a single number or formula rather than a
  vector. For example, <kbd>C-x * g</kbd> on the text
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 a b</span></samp>&rsquo;
  produces the vector of three values &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[2, a, b]</span></samp>&rsquo;, but <kbd>C-u C-x * g</kbd>
  on the same region reads a formula which is a product of three
  things: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 a
  b</span></samp>&rsquo;. (The text &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a + b</span></samp>&rsquo;, on the other hand, will be
  grabbed as a vector of one element by plain <kbd>C-x * g</kbd>
  because the interpretation &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a, +,
  b]</span></samp>&rsquo; would be a syntax error.)</p>

  <p>If a different language has been specified (see <a href=
  "Language-Modes.html#Language-Modes">Language Modes</a>), the
  grabbed text will be interpreted according to that language.</p>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-r-2209" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-r-2209"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgrab_002drectangle-2210" id=
  "index-calc_002dgrab_002drectangle-2210"></a>The <kbd>C-x *
  r</kbd> (<code>calc-grab-rectangle</code>) command takes the text
  between point and mark and attempts to parse it as a matrix. If
  point and mark are both in the leftmost column, the lines in
  between are parsed in their entirety. Otherwise, point and mark
  define the corners of a rectangle whose contents are parsed.</p>

  <p>Each line of the grabbed area becomes a row of the matrix. The
  result will actually be a vector of vectors, which Calc will
  treat as a matrix only if every row contains the same number of
  values.</p>

  <p>If a line contains a portion surrounded by square brackets (or
  curly braces), that portion is interpreted as a vector which
  becomes a row of the matrix. Any text surrounding the bracketed
  portion on the line is ignored.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the entire line is interpreted as a row vector as
  if it were surrounded by square brackets. Leading line numbers
  (in the format used in the Calc stack buffer) are ignored. If you
  wish to force this interpretation (even if the line contains
  bracketed portions), give a negative numeric prefix argument to
  the <kbd>C-x * r</kbd> command.</p>

  <p>If you give a numeric prefix argument of zero or plain
  <kbd>C-u</kbd>, each line is instead interpreted as a single
  formula which is converted into a one-element vector. Thus the
  result of <kbd>C-u C-x * r</kbd> will be a one-column matrix. For
  example, suppose one line of the data is the expression
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 a</span></samp>&rsquo;. A plain
  <kbd>C-x&nbsp;*&nbsp;r</kbd><!-- /@w --> will interpret this as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[2 a]</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
  in turn is read as a two-element vector that forms one row of the
  matrix. But a <kbd>C-u C-x * r</kbd> will interpret this row as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[2*a]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If you give a positive numeric prefix argument <var>n</var>,
  then each line will be split up into columns of width
  <var>n</var>; each column is parsed separately as a matrix
  element. If a line contained &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2&nbsp;+/-&nbsp;3&nbsp;4&nbsp;+/-&nbsp;5</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->,
  then grabbing with a prefix argument of 8 would correctly split
  the line into two error forms.</p>

  <p>See <a href="Matrix-Functions.html#Matrix-Functions">Matrix
  Functions</a>, to see how to pull the matrix apart into its
  constituent rows and columns. (If it is a
  <!-- @math{1\times1} -->
   1x1 matrix, just hit <kbd>v u</kbd> (<code>calc-unpack</code>)
  twice.)</p>

  "index-Summing-rows-and-columns-of-data-2215" id=
  "index-Summing-rows-and-columns-of-data-2215"></a>The <kbd>C-x *
  :</kbd> (<code>calc-grab-sum-down</code>) command is a handy way
  to grab a rectangle of data and sum its columns. It is equivalent
  to typing <kbd>C-x * r</kbd>, followed by <kbd>V R : +</kbd> (the
  vector reduction command that sums the columns of a matrix; see
  <a href="Reducing.html#Reducing">Reducing</a>). The result of the
  command will be a vector of numbers, one for each column in the
  input data. The <kbd>C-x * _</kbd>
  (<code>calc-grab-sum-across</code>) command similarly grabs a
  rectangle and sums its rows by executing
  <kbd>V&nbsp;R&nbsp;_&nbsp;+</kbd><!-- /@w -->.</p>

  <p>As well as being more convenient, <kbd>C-x * :</kbd> and
  <kbd>C-x * _</kbd> are also much faster because they don't
  actually place the grabbed vector on the stack. In a <kbd>C-x * r
  V R : +</kbd> sequence, formatting the vector for display on the
  stack takes a large fraction of the total time (unless you have
  planned ahead and used <kbd>v .</kbd> and <kbd>t .</kbd>
  modes).</p>

  <p>For example, suppose we have a column of numbers in a file
  which we wish to sum. Go to one corner of the column and press
  <kbd>C-@</kbd> to set the mark; go to the other corner and type
  <kbd>C-x * :</kbd>. Since there is only one column, the result
  will be a vector of one number, the sum. (You can type <kbd>v
  u</kbd> to unpack this vector into a plain number if you want to
  do further arithmetic with it.)</p>

  <p>To compute the product of the column of numbers, we would have
  to do it &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; since there's no special
  grab-and-multiply command. Use <kbd>C-x * r</kbd> to grab the
  column of numbers into the calculator in the form of a column
  matrix. The statistics command <kbd>u *</kbd> is a handy way to
  find the product of a vector or matrix of numbers. See <a href=
  "Statistical-Operations.html#Statistical-Operations">Statistical
  Operations</a>. Another approach would be to use an explicit
  column reduction command, <kbd>V R : *</kbd>.</p>
