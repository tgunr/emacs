  <h4 class="subsection">11.11.8 Multi-Phase Rewrite Rules</h4>

  <p class="noindent">It is possible to separate a rewrite rule set
  into several <dfn>phases</dfn>. During each phase, certain rules
  will be enabled while certain others will be disabled. A
  <dfn>phase schedule</dfn> controls the order in which phases
  occur during the rewriting process.</p>

  <p><a name="index-phase-1939" id="index-phase-1939"></a><a name=
  "index-all-1940" id="index-all-1940"></a>If a call to the marker
  function <code>phase</code> appears in the rules vector in place
  of a rule, all rules following that point will be members of the
  phase(s) identified in the arguments to <code>phase</code>.
  Phases are given integer numbers. The markers
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phase()</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phase(all)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  both mean the following rules belong to all phases; this is the
  default at the start of the rule set.</p>

  <p>If you do not explicitly schedule the phases, Calc sorts all
  phase numbers that appear in the rule set and executes the phases
  in ascending order. For example, the rule set</p>
  <pre class="example">
     [ f0(x) := g0(x),
       phase(1),
       f1(x) := g1(x),
       phase(2),
       f2(x) := g2(x),
       phase(3),
       f3(x) := g3(x),
       phase(1,2),
       f4(x) := g4(x) ]
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">has three phases, 1 through 3. Phase 1
  consists of the <code>f0</code>, <code>f1</code>, and
  <code>f4</code> rules (in that order). Phase 2 consists of
  <code>f0</code>, <code>f2</code>, and <code>f4</code>. Phase 3
  consists of <code>f0</code> and <code>f3</code>.</p>

  <p>When Calc rewrites a formula using this rule set, it first
  rewrites the formula using only the phase 1 rules until no
  further changes are possible. Then it switches to the phase 2
  rule set and continues until no further changes occur, then
  finally rewrites with phase 3. When no more phase 3 rules apply,
  rewriting finishes. (This is assuming <kbd>a r</kbd> with a large
  enough prefix argument to allow the rewriting to run to
  completion; the sequence just described stops early if the number
  of iterations specified in the prefix argument, 100 by default,
  is reached.)</p>

  <p>During each phase, Calc descends through the nested levels of
  the formula as described previously. (See <a href=
  "Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules.html#Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules">
  Nested Formulas with Rewrite Rules</a>.) Rewriting starts at the
  top of the formula, then works its way down to the parts, then
  goes back to the top and works down again. The phase 2 rules do
  not begin until no phase 1 rules apply anywhere in the
  formula.</p>

  <p><a name="index-schedule-1941" id="index-schedule-1941"></a>A
  <code>schedule</code> marker appearing in the rule set (anywhere,
  but conventionally at the top) changes the default schedule of
  phases. In the simplest case, <code>schedule</code> has a
  sequence of phase numbers for arguments; each phase number is
  invoked in turn until the arguments to <code>schedule</code> are
  exhausted. Thus adding &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">schedule(3,2,1)</span></samp>&rsquo; at the top of the
  above rule set would reverse the order of the phases;
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">schedule(1,2,3)</span></samp>&rsquo; would have no effect
  since this is the default schedule; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">schedule(1,2,1,3)</span></samp>&rsquo; would give phase 1
  a second chance after phase 2 has completed, before moving on to
  phase 3.</p>

  <p>Any argument to <code>schedule</code> can instead be a vector
  of phase numbers (or even of sub-vectors). Then the sub-sequence
  of phases described by the vector are tried repeatedly until no
  change occurs in any phase in the sequence. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schedule([1, 2],
  3)</span></samp>&rsquo; tries phase 1, then phase 2, then, if
  either phase made any changes to the formula, repeats these two
  phases until they can make no further progress. Finally, it goes
  on to phase 3 for finishing touches.</p>

  <p>Also, items in <code>schedule</code> can be variable names as
  well as numbers. A variable name is interpreted as the name of a
  function to call on the whole formula. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schedule(1,
  simplify)</span></samp>&rsquo; says to apply the phase-1 rules
  (presumably, all of them), then to call <code>simplify</code>
  which is the function name equivalent of <kbd>a s</kbd>.
  Likewise, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schedule([1,
  simplify])</span></samp>&rsquo; says to alternate between phase 1
  and <kbd>a s</kbd> until no further changes occur.</p>

  <p>Phases can be used purely to improve efficiency; if it is
  known that a certain group of rules will apply only at the
  beginning of rewriting, and a certain other group will apply only
  at the end, then rewriting will be faster if these groups are
  identified as separate phases. Once the phase 1 rules are done,
  Calc can put them aside and no longer spend any time on them
  while it works on phase 2.</p>

  <p>There are also some problems that can only be solved with
  several rewrite phases. For a real-world example of a multi-phase
  rule set, examine the set <code>FitRules</code>, which is used by
  the curve-fitting command to convert a model expression to linear
  form. See <a href=
  "Curve-Fitting-Details.html#Curve-Fitting-Details">Curve Fitting
  Details</a>. This set is divided into four phases. The first
  phase rewrites certain kinds of expressions to be more easily
  linearizable, but less computationally efficient. After the
  linear components have been picked out, the final phase includes
  the opposite rewrites to put each component back into an
  efficient form. If both sets of rules were included in one big
  phase, Calc could get into an infinite loop going back and forth
  between the two forms.</p>

  <p>Elsewhere in <code>FitRules</code>, the components are first
  isolated, then recombined where possible to reduce the complexity
  of the linear fit, then finally packaged one component at a time
  into vectors. If the packaging rules were allowed to begin before
  the recombining rules were finished, some components might be put
  away into vectors before they had a chance to recombine. By
  putting these rules in two separate phases, this problem is
  neatly avoided.</p>
