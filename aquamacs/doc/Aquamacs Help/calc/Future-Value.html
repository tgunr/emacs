  <h4 class="subsection">8.6.2 Future Value</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-b-F-871" id=
  "index-b-F-871"></a><a name="index-calc_002dfin_002dfv-872" id=
  "index-calc_002dfin_002dfv-872"></a><a name="index-fv-873" id=
  "index-fv-873"></a>The <kbd>b F</kbd> (<code>calc-fin-fv</code>)
  [<code>fv</code>] command computes the future value of an
  investment. It takes three arguments from the stack:
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fv(</span><var>rate</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>n</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>payment</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;. If
  you give payments of <var>payment</var> every year for
  <var>n</var> years, and the money you have paid earns interest at
  <var>rate</var> per year, then this function tells you what your
  investment would be worth at the end of the period. (The actual
  interval doesn't have to be years, as long as <var>n</var> and
  <var>rate</var> are expressed in terms of the same intervals.)
  This function assumes payments occur at the <em>end</em> of each
  interval.</p>

  <p><a name="index-I-b-F-874" id="index-I-b-F-874"></a><a name=
  "index-fvb-875" id="index-fvb-875"></a>The <kbd>I b F</kbd>
  [<code>fvb</code>] command does the same computation, but
  assuming your payments are at the beginning of each interval.
  Suppose you plan to deposit $1000 per year in a savings account
  earning 5.4% interest, starting right now. How much will be in
  the account after five years? <code>fvb(5.4%, 5, 1000) =
  5870.73</code>. Thus you will have earned $870 worth of interest
  over the years. Using the stack, this calculation would have been
  <kbd>5.4 M-% 5 &lt;RET&gt; 1000 I b F</kbd>. Note that the rate
  is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, <em>not</em> as a
  percentage.</p>

  <p><a name="index-H-b-F-876" id="index-H-b-F-876"></a><a name=
  "index-fvl-877" id="index-fvl-877"></a>The <kbd>H b F</kbd>
  [<code>fvl</code>] command computes the future value of an
  initial lump sum investment. Suppose you could deposit those five
  thousand dollars in the bank right now; how much would they be
  worth in five years? <code>fvl(5.4%, 5, 5000) =
  6503.89</code>.</p>

  <p>The algebraic functions <code>fv</code> and <code>fvb</code>
  accept an optional fourth argument, which is used as an initial
  lump sum in the sense of <code>fvl</code>. In other words,
  <code>fv(</code><var>rate</var><code>,</code>
  <var>n</var><code>,</code> <var>payment</var><code>,</code>
  <var>initial</var><code>) =
  fv(</code><var>rate</var><code>,</code>
  <var>n</var><code>,</code> <var>payment</var><code>) +
  fvl(</code><var>rate</var><code>,</code>
  <var>n</var><code>,</code> <var>initial</var><code>)</code>.</p>

  <p>To illustrate the relationships between these functions, we
  could do the <code>fvb</code> calculation &ldquo;by hand&rdquo;
  using <code>fvl</code>. The final balance will be the sum of the
  contributions of our five deposits at various times. The first
  deposit earns interest for five years: <code>fvl(5.4%, 5, 1000) =
  1300.78</code>. The second deposit only earns interest for four
  years: <code>fvl(5.4%, 4, 1000) = 1234.13</code>. And so on down
  to the last deposit, which earns one year's interest:
  <code>fvl(5.4%, 1, 1000) = 1054.00</code>. The sum of these five
  values is, sure enough, $5870.73, just as was computed by
  <code>fvb</code> directly.</p>

  <p>What does <code>fv(5.4%, 5, 1000) = 5569.96</code> mean? The
  payments are now at the ends of the periods. The end of one year
  is the same as the beginning of the next, so what this really
  means is that we've lost the payment at year zero (which
  contributed $1300.78), but we're now counting the payment at year
  five (which, since it didn't have a chance to earn interest,
  counts as $1000). Indeed, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5569.96
  = 5870.73 - 1300.78 + 1000</span></samp>&rsquo; (give or take a
  bit of roundoff error).</p>
