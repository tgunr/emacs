  <h4 class="subsection">11.11.3 Conditional Rewrite Rules</h4>

  <p class="noindent">A rewrite rule can also be
  <dfn>conditional</dfn>, written in the form
  &lsquo;<samp><var>old</var> <span class="samp">:=</span>
  <var>new</var> <span class="samp">::</span>
  <var>cond</var></samp>&rsquo;. (There is also the obsolete form
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[</span><var>old</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>new</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>cond</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.) If a
  <var>cond</var> part is present in the rule, this is an
  additional condition that must be satisfied before the rule is
  accepted. Once <var>old</var> has been successfully matched to
  the target expression, <var>cond</var> is evaluated (with all the
  meta-variables substituted for the values they matched) and
  simplified with <kbd>a s</kbd> (<code>calc-simplify</code>). If
  the result is a nonzero number or any other object known to be
  nonzero (see <a href=
  "Declarations.html#Declarations">Declarations</a>), the rule is
  accepted. If the result is zero or if it is a symbolic formula
  that is not known to be nonzero, the rule is rejected. See
  <a href="Logical-Operations.html#Logical-Operations">Logical
  Operations</a>, for a number of functions that return 1 or 0
  according to the results of various tests.</p>

  <p>For example, the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n
  &gt; 0</span></samp>&rsquo; simplifies to 1 or 0 if
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  replaced by a positive or nonpositive number, respectively (or if
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; has been
  declared to be positive or nonpositive). Thus, the rule
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x,y) := g(y+x,x) :: x+y &gt;
  0</span></samp>&rsquo; would apply to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(0, 4)</span></samp>&rsquo; but not to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(-3, 2)</span></samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(12, a+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (assuming no outstanding declarations for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;). In the
  case of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(-3,
  2)</span></samp>&rsquo;, the condition can be shown not to be
  satisfied; in the case of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(12,
  a+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, the condition merely cannot be shown
  to be satisfied, but that is enough to reject the rule.</p>

  <p>While Calc will use declarations to reason about variables in
  the formula being rewritten, declarations do not apply to
  meta-variables. For example, the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(a) := g(a+1)</span></samp>&rsquo; will match for any
  values of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  such as complex numbers, vectors, or formulas, even if
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; has been
  declared to be real or scalar. If you want the meta-variable
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; to match
  only literal real numbers, use &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(a) := g(a+1) :: real(a)</span></samp>&rsquo;. If you
  want &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  match only reals and formulas which are provably real, use
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dreal(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; as
  the condition.</p>

  <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operator is a shorthand for the <code>condition</code> function;
  &lsquo;<samp><var>old</var> <span class="samp">:=</span>
  <var>new</var> <span class="samp">::</span>
  <var>cond</var></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">condition(assign(</span><var>old</var><span class=
  "samp">,</span> <var>new</var><span class="samp">),</span>
  <var>cond</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If you have several conditions, you can use
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">... :: c1 :: c2 ::
  c3</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">... ::
  c1 &amp;&amp; c2 &amp;&amp; c3</span></samp>&rsquo;. The two are
  entirely equivalent.</p>

  <p>It is also possible to embed conditions inside the pattern:
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x :: x&gt;0, y) := g(y+x,
  x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. This is purely a notational convenience,
  though; where a condition appears in a rule has no effect on when
  it is tested. The rewrite-rule compiler automatically decides
  when it is best to test each condition while a rule is being
  matched.</p>

  <p>Certain conditions are handled as special cases by the rewrite
  rule system and are tested very efficiently: Where
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is any
  meta-variable, these conditions are &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">integer(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">real(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">constant(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">negative(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x &gt;= y</span></samp>&rsquo;
  where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  either a constant or another meta-variable and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;=</span></samp>&rsquo; may be
  replaced by any of the six relational operators, and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x % a = b</span></samp>&rsquo;
  where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; are
  constants. Other conditions, like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x &gt;= y+1</span></samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dreal(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  will be less efficient to check since Calc must bring the whole
  evaluator and simplifier into play.</p>

  <p>An interesting property of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; is that neither of its arguments
  will be touched by Calc's default simplifications. This is
  important because conditions often are expressions that cannot
  safely be evaluated early. For example, the <code>typeof</code>
  function never remains in symbolic form; entering
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">typeof(a)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  will put the number 100 (the type code for variables like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;) on the
  stack. But putting the condition &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">... :: typeof(a) = 6</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack is
  safe since &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; prevents the <code>typeof</code>
  from being evaluated until the condition is actually used by the
  rewrite system.</p>

  <p>Since &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo;
  protects its lefthand side, too, you can use a dummy condition to
  protect a rule that must itself not evaluate early. For example,
  it's not safe to put &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a(f,x) :=
  apply(f, [x])</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack because it will
  immediately evaluate to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a(f,x) :=
  f(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where the meta-variable-ness of
  <code>f</code> on the righthand side has been lost. But
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a(f,x) := apply(f, [x]) ::
  1</span></samp>&rsquo; is safe, and of course the condition
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; is always
  true (nonzero) so it has no effect on the functioning of the
  rule. (The rewrite compiler will ensure that it doesn't even
  impact the speed of matching the rule.)</p>
