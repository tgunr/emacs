  <h4 class="subsection">3.7.57 Rewrites Tutorial Exercise 6</h4>

  <p class="noindent">Here is a rule set that will do the job:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     [ a*(b + c) := a*b + a*c,
       opt(a) O(x^n) + opt(b) O(x^m) := O(x^n) :: n &lt;= m
          :: constant(a) :: constant(b),
       opt(a) O(x^n) + opt(b) x^m := O(x^n) :: n &lt;= m
          :: constant(a) :: constant(b),
       a O(x^n) := O(x^n) :: constant(a),
       x^opt(m) O(x^n) := O(x^(n+m)),
       O(x^n) O(x^m) := O(x^(n+m)) ]
</pre>

  <p>If we really want the <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>*</kbd> keys to
  operate naturally on power series, we should put these rules in
  <code>EvalRules</code>. For testing purposes, it is better to put
  them in a different variable, say, <code>O</code>, first.</p>

  <p>The first rule just expands products of sums so that the rest
  of the rules can assume they have an expanded-out polynomial to
  work with. Note that this rule does not mention
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O</span></samp>&rsquo; at all, so
  it will apply to any product-of-sum it encounters&mdash;this rule
  may surprise you if you put it into <code>EvalRules</code>!</p>

  <p>In the second rule, the sum of two O's is changed to the
  smaller O. The optional constant coefficients are there mostly so
  that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^2) -
  O(x^3)</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">O(x^3) - O(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo; are handled as well
  as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^2) +
  O(x^3)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The third rule absorbs higher powers of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; into
  O's.</p>

  <p>The fourth rule says that a constant times a negligible
  quantity is still negligible. (This rule will also match
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^3) / 4</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a =
  1/4</span></samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  <p>The fifth rule rewrites, for example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2 O(x^3)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^5)</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  (It is easy to see that if one of these forms is negligible, the
  other is, too.) Notice the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^opt(m)</span></samp>&rsquo; to pick up terms like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x&nbsp;O(x^3)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->. Optional
  powers will match &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^1</span></samp>&rsquo; but not 1 as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^0</span></samp>&rsquo;. This
  turns out to be exactly what we want here.</p>

  <p>The sixth rule is the corresponding rule for products of two
  O's.</p>

  <p>Another way to solve this problem would be to create a new
  &ldquo;data type&rdquo; that represents truncated power series.
  We might represent these as function calls
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">series(</span><var>coefs</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>x</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; where
  <var>coefs</var> is a vector of coefficients for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^0</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^1</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so
  on. Rules would exist for sums and products of such
  <code>series</code> objects, and as an optional convenience could
  also know how to combine a <code>series</code> object with a
  normal polynomial. (With this, and with a rule that rewrites
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^n)</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  the equivalent <code>series</code> form, you could still enter
  power series in exactly the same notation as before.) Operations
  on such objects would probably be more efficient, although the
  objects would be a bit harder to read.
  <!-- [fix-ref Compositions] --></p>

  <p>Some other symbolic math programs provide a power series data
  type similar to this. Mathematica, for example, has an object
  that looks like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">PowerSeries[</span><var>x</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>x0</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>coefs</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>nmin</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>nmax</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>den</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;, where
  <var>x0</var> is the point about which the power series is taken
  (we've been assuming this was always zero), and <var>nmin</var>,
  <var>nmax</var>, and <var>den</var> allow pseudo-power-series
  with fractional or negative powers. Also, the
  <code>PowerSeries</code> objects have a special display format
  that makes them look like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x^2 +
  O(x^4)</span></samp>&rsquo; when they are printed out. (See
  <a href="Compositions.html#Compositions">Compositions</a>, for a
  way to do this in Calc, although for something as involved as
  this it would probably be better to write the formatting routine
  in Lisp.)</p>
