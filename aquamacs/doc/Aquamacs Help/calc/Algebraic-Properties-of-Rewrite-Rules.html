  <h4 class="subsection">11.11.4 Algebraic Properties of Rewrite
  Rules</h4>

  <p class="noindent">The rewrite mechanism understands the
  algebraic properties of functions like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;. In particular, pattern matching
  takes the associativity and commutativity of the following
  functions into account:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     + - *  = !=  &amp;&amp; ||  and or xor  vint vunion vxor  gcd lcm  max min  beta
</pre>

  <p>For example, the rewrite rule:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     a x + b x  :=  (a + b) x
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">will match formulas of the form,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     a x + b x,  x a + x b,  a x + x b,  x a + b x
</pre>

  <p>Rewrites also understand the relationship between the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; operators.
  The above rewrite rule will also match the formulas,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     a x - b x,  x a - x b,  a x - x b,  x a - b x
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">by matching &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; in the pattern to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-b</span></samp>&rsquo; from the
  formula.</p>

  <p>Applied to a sum of many terms like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">r + a x + s + b x + t</span></samp>&rsquo;, this pattern
  will check all pairs of terms for possible matches. The rewrite
  will take whichever suitable pair it discovers first.</p>

  <p>In general, a pattern using an associative operator like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b</span></samp>&rsquo; will
  try <var>2 n</var> different ways to match a sum of <var>n</var>
  terms like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + z -
  w</span></samp>&rsquo;. First, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; is matched against each of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-w</span></samp>&rsquo; in turn,
  with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; being
  matched to the remainders &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y + z -
  w</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + z -
  w</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc. If none of these succeed, then
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; is matched
  against each of the four terms with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; matching the remainder.
  Half-and-half matches, like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x +
  y) + (z - w)</span></samp>&rsquo;, are not tried.</p>

  <p>Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; is not commutative when applied to
  matrices, but rewrite rules pretend that it is. If you type
  <kbd>m v</kbd> to enable Matrix mode (see <a href=
  "Matrix-Mode.html#Matrix-Mode">Matrix Mode</a>), rewrite rules
  will match &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;
  literally, ignoring its usual commutativity property. (In the
  current implementation, the associativity also vanishes&mdash;it
  is as if the pattern had been enclosed in a <code>plain</code>
  marker; see below.) If you are applying rewrites to formulas with
  matrices, it's best to enable Matrix mode first to prevent
  algebraically incorrect rewrites from occurring.</p>

  <p>The pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-x</span></samp>&rsquo; will actually match any
  expression. For example, the rule</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(-x)  :=  -f(x)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">will rewrite &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-f(-a)</span></samp>&rsquo;. To avoid this, either use a
  <code>plain</code> marker as described below, or add a
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">negative(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  condition. The <code>negative</code> function is true if its
  argument &ldquo;looks&rdquo; negative, for example, because it is
  a negative number or because it is a formula like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x</span></samp>&rsquo;. The new
  rule using this condition is:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(x)  :=  -f(-x)  :: negative(x)    <span class=
"roman">or, equivalently,</span>
     f(-x)  :=  -f(x)  :: negative(-x)
</pre>

  <p>In the same way, the pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x
  - y</span></samp>&rsquo; will match the sum
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b</span></samp>&rsquo; by
  matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;
  to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-b</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a
  b</span></samp>&rsquo; will also match the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x/y</span></samp>&rsquo; if
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; is a
  number. Thus the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x +
  b&nbsp;x<!-- /@w --> := (a+b) x</span></samp>&rsquo; will also
  convert &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x + x /
  2</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a +
  0.5) x</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(a + 1:2) x</span></samp>&rsquo;, depending on the current
  fraction mode).</p>

  <p>Calc will <em>not</em> take other liberties with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;. For
  example, the pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(a
  b)</span></samp>&rsquo; will not match &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(a + b)</span></samp>&rsquo; will not match
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(2 x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, even
  though conceivably these patterns could match with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a = b = x</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  Nor will &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(a
  b)</span></samp>&rsquo; match &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x
  / y)</span></samp>&rsquo; if &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; is not a constant, even though it
  could be considered to match with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a = x</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">b = 1/y</span></samp>&rsquo;. The reasons are partly for
  efficiency, and partly because while few mathematical operations
  are substantively different for addition and subtraction, often
  it is preferable to treat the cases of multiplication, division,
  and integer powers separately.</p>

  <p>Even more subtle is the rule set</p>
  <pre class="example">
     [ f(a) + f(b) := f(a + b),  -f(a) := f(-a) ]
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">attempting to match &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(x) - f(y)</span></samp>&rsquo;. You might think that
  Calc will view this subtraction as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(x) + (-f(y))</span></samp>&rsquo; and then apply the
  above two rules in turn, but actually this will not work because
  Calc only does this when considering rules for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; (like the
  first rule in this set). So it will see first that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x) +
  (-f(y))</span></samp>&rsquo; does not match
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(a) + f(b)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  for any assignments of the meta-variables, and then it will see
  that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x) -
  f(y)</span></samp>&rsquo; does not match
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; for
  any assignment of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;. Because Calc tries only one rule
  at a time, it will not be able to rewrite
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x) - f(y)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  with this rule set. An explicit &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(a) - f(b)</span></samp>&rsquo; rule will have to be
  added.</p>

  <p>Another thing patterns will <em>not</em> do is break up
  complex numbers. The pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">myconj(a + b&nbsp;i)<!-- /@w --> := a - b
  i</span></samp>&rsquo; will work for formulas involving the
  special constant &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; (such as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">3 - 4 i</span></samp>&rsquo;), but it will not match
  actual complex numbers like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(3,
  -4)</span></samp>&rsquo;. A version of the above rule for complex
  numbers would be</p>
  <pre class="example">
     myconj(a)  :=  re(a) - im(a) (0,1)  :: im(a) != 0
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(Because the <code>re</code> and
  <code>im</code> functions understand the properties of the
  special constant &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;, this rule will also work for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 - 4 i</span></samp>&rsquo;. In
  fact, this particular rule would probably be better without the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">im(a) != 0</span></samp>&rsquo;
  condition, since if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">im(a) =
  0</span></samp>&rsquo; the righthand side of the rule will still
  give the correct answer for the conjugate of a real number.)</p>

  <p>It is also possible to specify optional arguments in patterns.
  The rule</p>
  <pre class="example">
     opt(a) x + opt(b) (x^opt(c) + opt(d))  :=  f(a, b, c, d)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">will match the formula</p>
  <pre class="example">
     5 (x^2 - 4) + 3 x
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">in a fairly straightforward manner, but it
  will also match reduced formulas like</p>
  <pre class="example">
     x + x^2,    2(x + 1) - x,    x + x
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">producing, respectively,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(1, 1, 2, 0),   f(-1, 2, 1, 1),   f(1, 1, 1, 0)
</pre>

  <p>(The latter two formulas can be entered only if default
  simplifications have been turned off with <kbd>m O</kbd>.)</p>

  <p>The default value for a term of a sum is zero. The default
  value for a part of a product, for a power, or for the
  denominator of a quotient, is one. Also,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x</span></samp>&rsquo; matches
  the pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">opt(a)
  b</span></samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a =
  -1</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>In particular, the distributive-law rule can be refined to</p>
  <pre class="example">
     opt(a) x + opt(b) x  :=  (a + b) x
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">so that it will convert, e.g.,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x - x</span></samp>&rsquo;, to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a - 1)
  x</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">opt(a) + opt(b)
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; matches almost any formulas which are
  linear in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  You can also use the <code>lin</code> and <code>islin</code>
  functions with rewrite conditions to test for this; see <a href=
  "Logical-Operations.html#Logical-Operations">Logical
  Operations</a>. These functions are not as convenient to use in
  rewrite rules, but they recognize more kinds of formulas as
  linear: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x/z</span></samp>&rsquo;
  is considered linear with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b =
  1/z</span></samp>&rsquo; by <code>lin</code>, but it will not
  match the above pattern because that pattern calls for a
  multiplication, not a division.</p>

  <p>As another example, the obvious rule to replace
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x)^2 +
  cos(x)^2</span></samp>&rsquo; by 1,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2  :=  1
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">misses many cases because the sine and cosine
  may both be multiplied by an equal factor. Here's a more
  successful rule:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     opt(a) sin(x)^2 + opt(a) cos(x)^2  :=  a
</pre>

  <p>Note that this rule will <em>not</em> match
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x)^2 + 6
  cos(x)^2</span></samp>&rsquo; because one
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; would have
  &ldquo;matched&rdquo; 1 while the other matched 6.</p>

  <p>Calc automatically converts a rule like</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(x-1, x)  :=  g(x)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">into the form</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(temp, x)  :=  g(x)  :: temp = x-1
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(where <code>temp</code> stands for a new,
  invented meta-variable that doesn't actually have a name). This
  modified rule will successfully match &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(6, 7)</span></samp>&rsquo;, binding
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">temp</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; to 6 and
  7, respectively, then verifying that they differ by one even
  though &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">6</span></samp>&rsquo;
  does not superficially look like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x-1</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>However, Calc does not solve equations to interpret a rule.
  The following rule,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(x-1, x+1)  :=  g(x)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">will not work. That is, it will match
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(a - 1 + b, a + 1 +
  b)</span></samp>&rsquo; but not &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(6, 8)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Calc always interprets at
  least one occurrence of a variable by literal matching. If the
  variable appears &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; then Calc is smart enough
  to use it for literal matching. But in this last example, Calc is
  forced to rewrite the rule to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(x-1, temp) := g(x) :: temp = x+1</span></samp>&rsquo;
  where the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x-1</span></samp>&rsquo; term must correspond to an actual
  &ldquo;something-minus-one&rdquo; in the target formula.</p>

  <p>A successful way to write this would be
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x, x+2) :=
  g(x+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;. You could make this resemble the
  original form more closely by using <code>let</code> notation,
  which is described in the next section:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     f(xm1, x+1)  :=  g(x)  :: let(x := xm1+1)
</pre>

  <p>Calc does this rewriting or &ldquo;conditionalizing&rdquo; for
  any sub-pattern which involves only the functions in the
  following list, operating only on constants and meta-variables
  which have already been matched elsewhere in the pattern. When
  matching a function call, Calc is careful to match arguments
  which are plain variables before arguments which are calls to any
  of the functions below, so that a pattern like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x-1, x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  can be conditionalized even though the isolated
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; comes
  after the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x-1</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     + - * / \ % ^  abs sign  round rounde roundu trunc floor ceil
     max min  re im conj arg
</pre>

  <p>You can suppress all of the special treatments described in
  this section by surrounding a function call with a
  <code>plain</code> marker. This marker causes the function call
  which is its argument to be matched literally, without regard to
  commutativity, associativity, negation, or conditionalization.
  When you use <code>plain</code>, the &ldquo;deep structure&rdquo;
  of the formula being matched can show through. For example,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     plain(a - a b)  :=  f(a, b)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">will match only literal subtractions.
  However, the <code>plain</code> marker does not affect its
  arguments' arguments. In this case, commutativity and
  associativity is still considered while matching the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a&nbsp;b</span></samp>&rsquo;
  <!-- /@w --> sub-pattern, so the whole pattern will match
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x - y x</span></samp>&rsquo; as
  well as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x - x
  y</span></samp>&rsquo;. We could go still further and use</p>
  <pre class="example">
     plain(a - plain(a b))  :=  f(a, b)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">which would do a completely strict match for
  the pattern.</p>

  <p>By contrast, the <code>quote</code> marker means that not only
  the function name but also the arguments must be literally the
  same. The above pattern will match &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x - x y</span></samp>&rsquo; but</p>
  <pre class="example">
     quote(a - a b)  :=  f(a, b)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">will match only the single formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a - a b</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  Also,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     quote(a - quote(a b))  :=  f(a, b)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">will match only &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a - quote(a b)</span></samp>&rsquo;&mdash;probably not the
  desired effect!</p>

  <p>A certain amount of algebra is also done when substituting the
  meta-variables on the righthand side of a rule. For example, in
  the rule</p>
  <pre class="example">
     a + f(b)  :=  f(a + b)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x)
  - y</span></samp>&rsquo; would produce &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f((-y) + x)</span></samp>&rsquo; if taken literally, but
  the rewrite mechanism will simplify the righthand side to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x - y)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  automatically. (Of course, the default simplifications would do
  this anyway, so this special simplification is only noticeable if
  you have turned the default simplifications off.) This rewriting
  is done only when a meta-variable expands to a
  &ldquo;negative-looking&rdquo; expression. If this simplification
  is not desirable, you can use a <code>plain</code> marker on the
  righthand side:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     a + f(b)  :=  f(plain(a + b))
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">In this example, we are still allowing the
  pattern-matcher to use all the algebra it can muster, but the
  righthand side will always simplify to a literal addition like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f((-y) +
  x)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
