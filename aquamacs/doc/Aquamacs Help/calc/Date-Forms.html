  <h3 class="section">5.9 Date Forms</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-Date-forms-271" id=
  "index-Date-forms-271"></a>A <dfn>date form</dfn> represents a
  date and possibly an associated time. Simple date arithmetic is
  supported: Adding a number to a date produces a new date shifted
  by that many days; adding an HMS form to a date shifts it by that
  many hours. Subtracting two date forms computes the number of
  days between them (represented as a simple number). Many other
  operations, such as multiplying two date forms, are nonsensical
  and are not allowed by Calc.</p>

  <p>Date forms are entered and displayed enclosed in
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt; &gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  brackets. The default format is, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&lt;Wed Jan 9, 1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; for dates, or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;3:32:20pm Wed Jan 9,
  1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; for dates with times. Input is
  flexible; date forms can be entered in any of the usual notations
  for dates and times. See <a href=
  "Date-Formats.html#Date-Formats">Date Formats</a>.</p>

  <p>Date forms are stored internally as numbers, specifically the
  number of days since midnight on the morning of January 1 of the
  year 1 AD. If the internal number is an integer, the form
  represents a date only; if the internal number is a fraction or
  float, the form represents a date and time. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;6:00am Wed Jan 9,
  1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; is represented by the number
  726842.25. The standard precision of 12 decimal digits is enough
  to ensure that a (reasonable) date and time can be stored without
  roundoff error.</p>

  <p>If the current precision is greater than 12, date forms will
  keep additional digits in the seconds position. For example, if
  the precision is 15, the seconds will keep three digits after the
  decimal point. Decreasing the precision below 12 may cause the
  time part of a date form to become inaccurate. This can also
  happen if astronomically high years are used, though this will
  not be an issue in everyday (or even everymillennium) use. Note
  that date forms without times are stored as exact integers, so
  roundoff is never an issue for them.</p>

  <p>You can use the <kbd>v p</kbd> (<code>calc-pack</code>) and
  <kbd>v u</kbd> (<code>calc-unpack</code>) commands to get at the
  numerical representation of a date form. See <a href=
  "Packing-and-Unpacking.html#Packing-and-Unpacking">Packing and
  Unpacking</a>.</p>

  <p>Date forms can go arbitrarily far into the future or past.
  Negative year numbers represent years BC. Calc uses a combination
  of the Gregorian and Julian calendars, following the history of
  Great Britain and the British colonies. This is the same calendar
  that is used by the <code>cal</code> program in most Unix
  implementations.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Julian-calendar-272" id=
  "index-Julian-calendar-272"></a><a name=
  "index-Gregorian-calendar-273" id=
  "index-Gregorian-calendar-273"></a>Some historical background:
  The Julian calendar was created by Julius Caesar in the year 46
  BC as an attempt to fix the gradual drift caused by the lack of
  leap years in the calendar used until that time. The Julian
  calendar introduced an extra day in all years divisible by four.
  After some initial confusion, the calendar was adopted around the
  year we call 8 AD. Some centuries later it became apparent that
  the Julian year of 365.25 days was itself not quite right. In
  1582 Pope Gregory XIII introduced the Gregorian calendar, which
  added the new rule that years divisible by 100, but not by 400,
  were not to be considered leap years despite being divisible by
  four. Many countries delayed adoption of the Gregorian calendar
  because of religious differences; in Britain it was put off until
  the year 1752, by which time the Julian calendar had fallen
  eleven days behind the true seasons. So the switch to the
  Gregorian calendar in early September 1752 introduced a
  discontinuity: The day after Sep 2, 1752 is Sep 14, 1752. Calc
  follows this convention. To take another example, Russia waited
  until 1918 before adopting the new calendar, and thus needed to
  remove thirteen days (between Feb 1, 1918 and Feb 14, 1918). This
  means that Calc's reckoning will be inconsistent with Russian
  history between 1752 and 1918, and similarly for various other
  countries.</p>

  <p>Today's timekeepers introduce an occasional &ldquo;leap
  second&rdquo; as well, but Calc does not take these minor effects
  into account. (If it did, it would have to report a non-integer
  number of days between, say, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&lt;12:00am Mon Jan 1, 1900&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;12:00am Sat Jan 1,
  2000&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  <p>Calc uses the Julian calendar for all dates before the year
  1752, including dates BC when the Julian calendar technically had
  not yet been invented. Thus the claim that day number
  <i>-10000</i> is called &ldquo;August 16, 28 BC&rdquo; should be
  taken with a grain of salt.</p>

  <p>Please note that there is no &ldquo;year 0&rdquo;; the day
  before &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Sat Jan 1,
  +1&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&lt;Fri Dec 31, -1&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;. These are
  days 0 and <i>-1</i> respectively in Calc's internal numbering
  scheme.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Julian-day-counting-274" id=
  "index-Julian-day-counting-274"></a>Another day counting system
  in common use is, confusingly, also called &ldquo;Julian.&rdquo;
  The Julian day number is the numbers of days since 12:00 noon
  (GMT) on Jan 1, 4713 BC, which in Calc's scheme (in GMT) is
  <i>-1721423.5</i> (recall that Calc starts at midnight instead of
  noon). Thus to convert a Calc date code obtained by unpacking a
  date form into a Julian day number, simply add 1721423.5 after
  compensating for the time zone difference. The built-in <kbd>t
  J</kbd> command performs this conversion for you.</p>

  <p>The Julian day number is based on the Julian cycle, which was
  invented in 1583 by Joseph Justus Scaliger. Scaliger named it the
  Julian cycle since it involves the Julian calendar, but some have
  suggested that Scaliger named it in honor of his father, Julius
  Caesar Scaliger. The Julian cycle is based on three other cycles:
  the indiction cycle, the Metonic cycle, and the solar cycle. The
  indiction cycle is a 15 year cycle originally used by the Romans
  for tax purposes but later used to date medieval documents. The
  Metonic cycle is a 19 year cycle; 19 years is close to being a
  common multiple of a solar year and a lunar month, and so every
  19 years the phases of the moon will occur on the same days of
  the year. The solar cycle is a 28 year cycle; the Julian calendar
  repeats itself every 28 years. The smallest time period which
  contains multiples of all three cycles is the least common
  multiple of 15 years, 19 years and 28 years, which (since they're
  pairwise relatively prime) is
  <!-- @math{15\times 19\times 28 = 7980} years. -->
   15*19*28 = 7980 years. This is the length of a Julian cycle.
  Working backwards, the previous year in which all three cycles
  began was 4713 BC, and so Scalinger chose that year as the
  beginning of a Julian cycle. Since at the time there were no
  historical records from before 4713 BC, using this year as a
  starting point had the advantage of avoiding negative year
  numbers. In 1849, the astronomer John Herschel (son of William
  Herschel) suggested using the number of days since the beginning
  of the Julian cycle as an astronomical dating system; this idea
  was taken up by other astronomers. (At the time, noon was the
  start of the astronomical day. Herschel originally suggested
  counting the days since Jan 1, 4713 BC at noon Alexandria time;
  this was later amended to noon GMT.) Julian day numbering is
  largely used in astronomy.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Unix-time-format-275" id=
  "index-Unix-time-format-275"></a>The Unix operating system
  measures time as an integer number of seconds since midnight, Jan
  1, 1970. To convert a Calc date value into a Unix time stamp,
  first subtract 719164 (the code for &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&lt;Jan 1, 1970&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;), then multiply
  by 86400 (the number of seconds in a day) and press <kbd>R</kbd>
  to round to the nearest integer. If you have a date form, you can
  simply subtract the day &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Jan
  1, 1970&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of unpacking and
  subtracting 719164. Likewise, divide by 86400 and add
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Jan 1,
  1970&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; to convert from Unix time to a Calc
  date form. (Note that Unix normally maintains the time in the GMT
  time zone; you may need to subtract five hours to get New York
  time, or eight hours for California time. The same is usually
  true of Julian day counts.) The built-in <kbd>t U</kbd> command
  performs these conversions.</p>
