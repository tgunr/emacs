  <h5 class="subsubsection">18.5.7.9 Hooks</h5>

  <p class="noindent">Hooks are variables which contain Lisp
  functions (or lists of functions) which are called at various
  times. Calc defines a number of hooks that help you to customize
  it in various ways. Calc uses the Lisp function
  <code>run-hooks</code> to invoke the hooks shown below. Several
  other customization-related variables are also described
  here.</p>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>calc-load-hook</b><var><a name=
    "index-calc_002dload_002dhook-2551" id=
    "index-calc_002dload_002dhook-2551"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This hook is called at the end of <samp><span class=
      "file">calc.el</span></samp>, after the file has been loaded,
      before any functions in it have been called, but after
      <code>calc-mode-map</code> and similar variables have been
      set up.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>calc-ext-load-hook</b><var><a name=
    "index-calc_002dext_002dload_002dhook-2552" id=
    "index-calc_002dext_002dload_002dhook-2552"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This hook is called at the end of <samp><span class=
      "file">calc-ext.el</span></samp>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>calc-start-hook</b><var><a name=
    "index-calc_002dstart_002dhook-2553" id=
    "index-calc_002dstart_002dhook-2553"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This hook is called as the last step in a <kbd>M-x
      calc</kbd> command. At this point, the Calc buffer has been
      created and initialized if necessary, the Calc window and
      trail window have been created, and the &ldquo;Welcome to
      Calc&rdquo; message has been displayed.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>calc-mode-hook</b><var><a name=
    "index-calc_002dmode_002dhook-2554" id=
    "index-calc_002dmode_002dhook-2554"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This hook is called when the Calc buffer is being created.
      Usually this will only happen once per Emacs session. The
      hook is called after Emacs has switched to the new buffer,
      the mode-settings file has been read if necessary, and all
      other buffer-local variables have been set up. After this
      hook returns, Calc will perform a <code>calc-refresh</code>
      operation, set up the mode line display, then evaluate any
      deferred <code>calc-define</code> properties that have not
      been evaluated yet.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>calc-trail-mode-hook</b><var><a name=
    "index-calc_002dtrail_002dmode_002dhook-2555" id=
    "index-calc_002dtrail_002dmode_002dhook-2555"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This hook is called when the Calc Trail buffer is being
      created. It is called as the very last step of setting up the
      Trail buffer. Like <code>calc-mode-hook</code>, this will
      normally happen only once per Emacs session.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>calc-end-hook</b><var><a name=
    "index-calc_002dend_002dhook-2556" id=
    "index-calc_002dend_002dhook-2556"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This hook is called by <code>calc-quit</code>, generally
      because the user presses <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>C-x * c</kbd>
      while in Calc. The Calc buffer will be the current buffer.
      The hook is called as the very first step, before the Calc
      window is destroyed.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>calc-window-hook</b><var><a name=
    "index-calc_002dwindow_002dhook-2557" id=
    "index-calc_002dwindow_002dhook-2557"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>If this hook is non-<code>nil</code>, it is called to
      create the Calc window. Upon return, this new Calc window
      should be the current window. (The Calc buffer will already
      be the current buffer when the hook is called.) If the hook
      is not defined, Calc will generally use
      <code>split-window</code>, <code>set-window-buffer</code>,
      and <code>select-window</code> to create the Calc window.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>calc-trail-window-hook</b><var><a name=
    "index-calc_002dtrail_002dwindow_002dhook-2558" id=
    "index-calc_002dtrail_002dwindow_002dhook-2558"></a></var><br />


    <blockquote>
      <p>If this hook is non-<code>nil</code>, it is called to
      create the Calc Trail window. The variable
      <code>calc-trail-buffer</code> will contain the buffer which
      the window should use. Unlike <code>calc-window-hook</code>,
      this hook must <em>not</em> switch into the new window.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>calc-embedded-mode-hook</b><var><a name=
    "index-calc_002dembedded_002dmode_002dhook-2559" id=
    "index-calc_002dembedded_002dmode_002dhook-2559"></a></var><br />


    <blockquote>
      <p>This hook is called the first time that Embedded mode is
      entered.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable:

    "index-calc_002dedit_002dmode_002dhook-2562"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This hook is called by <code>calc-edit</code> (and the
      other &ldquo;edit&rdquo; commands) when the temporary editing
      buffer is being created. The buffer will have been selected
      and set up to be in <code>calc-edit-mode</code>, but will not
      yet have been filled with text. (In fact it may still have
      leftover text from a previous <code>calc-edit</code>
      command.)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>calc-mode-save-hook</b><var><a name=

    "index-calc_002dmode_002dsave_002dhook-2563"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This hook is called by the <code>calc-save-modes</code>
      command, after Calc's own mode features have been inserted
      into the Calc init file and just before the &ldquo;End of
      mode settings&rdquo; message is inserted.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

    "index-calc_002dreset_002dhook-2564"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This hook is called after <kbd>C-x * 0</kbd>
      (<code>calc-reset</code>) has reset all modes. The Calc
      buffer will be the current buffer.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

    "index-calc_002dother_002dmodes-2565" id=
    "index-calc_002dother_002dmodes-2565"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>This variable contains a list of strings. The strings are
      concatenated at the end of the modes portion of the Calc mode
      line (after standard modes such as &ldquo;Deg&rdquo;,
      &ldquo;Inv&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hyp&rdquo;). Each string should
      be a short, single word followed by a space. The variable is
      <code>nil</code> by default.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the keymap that is used by Calc mode. The best
      time to adjust it is probably in a
      <code>calc-mode-hook</code>. If the Calc extensions package
      (<samp><span class="file">calc-ext.el</span></samp>) has not
      yet been loaded, many of these keys will be bound to
      <code>calc-missing-key</code>, which is a command that loads
      the extensions package and &ldquo;retypes&rdquo; the key. If
      your <code>calc-mode-hook</code> rebinds one of these keys,
      it will probably be overridden when the extensions are
      loaded.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the keymap that is used during numeric entry.
      Numeric entry uses the minibuffer, but this map binds every
      non-numeric key to <code>calcDigit-nondigit</code> which
      generally calls <code>exit-minibuffer</code> and
      &ldquo;retypes&rdquo; the key.</p>
