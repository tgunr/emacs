  <h3 class="section">14.3 Managing Curves</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The <kbd>g f</kbd> command is really
  shorthand for the following commands: <kbd>C-u g d g a g p</kbd>.
  Likewise, <kbd>g&nbsp;F</kbd><!-- /@w --> is shorthand for
  <kbd>C-u g d g A g p</kbd>. You can gain more control over your
  graph by using these commands directly.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-a-2106" id="index-g-a-2106"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dadd-2107" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dadd-2107"></a>The <kbd>g a</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-add</code>) command adds the
  &ldquo;curve&rdquo; represented by the two values on the top of
  the stack to the current graph. You can have any number of curves
  in the same graph. When you give the <kbd>g p</kbd> command, all
  the curves will be drawn superimposed on the same axes.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>g a</kbd> command (and many others that affect the
  current graph) will cause a special buffer,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo;, to be displayed in another
  window. This buffer is a template of the commands that will be
  sent to GNUPLOT when it is time to draw the graph. The first
  <kbd>g a</kbd> command adds a <code>plot</code> command to this
  buffer. Succeeding <kbd>g a</kbd> commands add extra curves onto
  that <code>plot</code> command. Other graph-related commands put
  other GNUPLOT commands into this buffer. In normal usage you
  never need to work with this buffer directly, but you can if you
  wish. The only constraint is that there must be only one
  <code>plot</code> command, and it must be the last command in the
  buffer. If you want to save and later restore a complete graph
  configuration, you can use regular Emacs commands to save and
  restore the contents of the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*Gnuplot Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer.</p>

  <p><a name="index-PlotData1-2108" id=
  "index-PlotData1-2108"></a><a name="index-PlotData2-2109" id=
  "index-PlotData2-2109"></a>If the values on the stack are not
  variable names, <kbd>g a</kbd> will invent variable names for
  them (of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">PlotData</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;) and store the
  values in those variables. The &ldquo;x&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;y&rdquo; variables are what go into the <code>plot</code>
  command in the template. If you add a curve that uses a certain
  variable and then later change that variable, you can replot the
  graph without having to delete and re-add the curve. That's
  because the variable name, not the vector, interval or formula
  itself, is what was added by <kbd>g a</kbd>.</p>

  <p>A numeric prefix argument on <kbd>g a</kbd> or <kbd>g f</kbd>
  changes the way stack entries are interpreted as curves. With a
  positive prefix argument &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, the top &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; stack entries are &ldquo;y&rdquo;
  values for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;
  different curves which share a common &ldquo;x&rdquo; value in
  the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n+1</span></samp>&rsquo;st
  stack entry. (Thus <kbd>g a</kbd> with no prefix argument is
  equivalent to <kbd>C-u 1 g a</kbd>.)</p>

  <p>A prefix of zero or plain <kbd>C-u</kbd> means to take two
  stack entries, &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo; as usual, but
  to interpret &ldquo;y&rdquo; as a vector of &ldquo;y&rdquo;
  values for several curves that share a common
  &ldquo;x&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>A negative prefix argument tells Calc to read
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; vectors
  from the stack; each vector &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[x,
  y]</span></samp>&rsquo; describes an independent curve. This is
  the only form of <kbd>g a</kbd> that creates several curves at
  once that don't have common &ldquo;x&rdquo; values. (Of course,
  the range of &ldquo;x&rdquo; values covered by all the curves
  ought to be roughly the same if they are to look nice on the same
  graph.)</p>

  <p>For example, to plot <!-- @math{\sin n x} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(n x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  for integers &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; from 1 to 5, you could use <kbd>v
  x</kbd> to create a vector of integers (&lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;), then <kbd>V M '</kbd> or <kbd>V M
  $</kbd> to map &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(n
  x)</span></samp>&rsquo; across this vector. The resulting vector
  of formulas is suitable for use as the &ldquo;y&rdquo; argument
  to a <kbd>C-u g a</kbd> or <kbd>C-u g f</kbd> command.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-A-2110" id="index-g-A-2110"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dadd_002d3d-2111" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dadd_002d3d-2111"></a>The <kbd>g A</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-add-3d</code>) command adds a 3D curve to the
  graph. It is not valid to intermix 2D and 3D curves in a single
  graph. This command takes three arguments, &ldquo;x&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;y&rdquo;, and &ldquo;z&rdquo;, from the stack. With a
  positive prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, it takes &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n+2</span></samp>&rsquo; arguments (common &ldquo;x&rdquo;
  and &ldquo;y&rdquo;, plus &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; separate &ldquo;z&rdquo;s). With a
  zero prefix, it takes three stack entries but the &ldquo;z&rdquo;
  entry is a vector of curve values. With a negative prefix
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>&rsquo;, it takes
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; vectors of
  the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[x, y,
  z]</span></samp>&rsquo;. The <kbd>g A</kbd> command works by
  adding a <code>splot</code> (surface-plot) command to the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer.</p>

  <p>(Although <kbd>g a</kbd> adds a 2D <code>plot</code> command
  to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, Calc changes this to
  <code>splot</code> before sending it to GNUPLOT if it notices
  that the data points are evaluating to <code>xyz</code> calls. It
  will not work to mix 2D and 3D <kbd>g a</kbd> curves in a single
  graph, although Calc does not currently check for this.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-d-2112" id="index-g-d-2112"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002ddelete-2113" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002ddelete-2113"></a>The <kbd>g d</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-delete</code>) command deletes the most
  recently added curve from the graph. It has no effect if there
  are no curves in the graph. With a numeric prefix argument of any
  kind, it deletes all of the curves from the graph.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-H-2114" id="index-g-H-2114"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dhide-2115" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dhide-2115"></a>The <kbd>g H</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-hide</code>) command &ldquo;hides&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;unhides&rdquo; the most recently added curve. A hidden
  curve will not appear in the actual plot, but information about
  it such as its name and line and point styles will be
  retained.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-j-2116" id="index-g-j-2116"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002djuggle-2117" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002djuggle-2117"></a>The <kbd>g j</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-juggle</code>) command moves the curve at the
  end of the list (the &ldquo;most recently added curve&rdquo;) to
  the front of the list. The next-most-recent curve is thus exposed
  for <kbd>g&nbsp;d</kbd><!-- /@w --> or similar commands to use.
  With <kbd>g j</kbd> you can work with any curve in the graph even
  though curve-related commands only affect the last curve in the
  list.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-p-2118" id="index-g-p-2118"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dplot-2119" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dplot-2119"></a>The <kbd>g p</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-plot</code>) command uses GNUPLOT to draw the
  graph described in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer. Any GNUPLOT parameters
  which are not defined by commands in this buffer are reset to
  their default values. The variables named in the
  <code>plot</code> command are written to a temporary data file
  and the variable names are then replaced by the file name in the
  template. The resulting plotting commands are fed to the GNUPLOT
  program. See the documentation for the GNUPLOT program for more
  specific information. All temporary files are removed when Emacs
  or GNUPLOT exits.</p>

  <p>If you give a formula for &ldquo;y&rdquo;, Calc will remember
  all the values that it calculates for the formula so that later
  plots can reuse these values. Calc throws out these saved values
  when you change any circumstances that may affect the data, such
  as switching from Degrees to Radians mode, or changing the value
  of a parameter in the formula. You can force Calc to recompute
  the data from scratch by giving a negative numeric prefix
  argument to <kbd>g p</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Calc uses a fairly rough step size when graphing formulas over
  intervals. This is to ensure quick response. You can
  &ldquo;refine&rdquo; a plot by giving a positive numeric prefix
  argument to <kbd>g p</kbd>. Calc goes through the data points it
  has computed and saved from previous plots of the function, and
  computes and inserts a new data point midway between each of the
  existing points. You can refine a plot any number of times, but
  beware that the amount of calculation involved doubles each
  time.</p>

  <p>Calc does not remember computed values for 3D graphs. This
  means the numerix prefix argument, if any, to <kbd>g p</kbd> is
  effectively ignored if the current graph is
  three-dimensional.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-P-2120" id="index-g-P-2120"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dprint-2121" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dprint-2121"></a>The <kbd>g P</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-print</code>) command is like <kbd>g p</kbd>,
  except that it sends the output to a printer instead of to the
  screen. More precisely, <kbd>g p</kbd> looks for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set terminal</span></samp>&rsquo;
  or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set
  output</span></samp>&rsquo; commands in the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer; lacking these it uses the
  default settings. However, <kbd>g P</kbd> ignores
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set terminal</span></samp>&rsquo;
  and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set
  output</span></samp>&rsquo; commands and uses a different set of
  default values. All of these values are controlled by the <kbd>g
  D</kbd> and <kbd>g O</kbd> commands discussed below. Provided
  everything is set up properly, <kbd>g p</kbd> will plot to the
  screen unless you have specified otherwise and <kbd>g P</kbd>
  will always plot to the printer.</p>
