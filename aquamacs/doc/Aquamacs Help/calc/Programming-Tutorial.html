  <h3 class="section">3.6 Programming Tutorial</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The Calculator is written entirely in Emacs
  Lisp, a highly extensible language. If you know Lisp, you can
  program the Calculator to do anything you like. Rewrite rules
  also work as a powerful programming system. But Lisp and rewrite
  rules take a while to master, and often all you want to do is
  define a new function or repeat a command a few times. Calc has
  features that allow you to do these things easily.</p>

  <p>One very limited form of programming is defining your own
  functions. Calc's <kbd>Z F</kbd> command allows you to define a
  function name and key sequence to correspond to any formula.
  Programming commands use the shift-<kbd>Z</kbd> prefix; the user
  commands they create use the lower case <kbd>z</kbd> prefix.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  1 + x + x^2 / 2 + x^3 / 6         1:  1 + x + x^2 / 2 + x^3 / 6
         .                                     .

         ' 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! &lt;RET&gt;         Z F e myexp &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt; y
</pre>

  <p>This polynomial is a Taylor series approximation to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. The
  <kbd>Z F</kbd> command asks a number of questions. The above
  answers say that the key sequence for our function should be
  <kbd>z e</kbd>; the <kbd>M-x</kbd> equivalent should be
  <code>calc-myexp</code>; the name of the function in algebraic
  formulas should also be <code>myexp</code>; the default argument
  list &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  acceptable; and finally <kbd>y</kbd> answers the question
  &ldquo;leave it in symbolic form for non-constant
  arguments?&rdquo;</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  1.3495     2:  1.3495     3:  1.3495
         .          1:  1.34986    2:  1.34986
                        .          1:  myexp(a + 1)
                                       .

         .3 z e         .3 E           ' a+1 &lt;RET&gt; z e
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">First we call our new <code>exp</code>
  approximation with 0.3 as an argument, and compare it with the
  true <code>exp</code> function. Then we note that, as requested,
  if we try to give <kbd>z e</kbd> an argument that isn't a plain
  number, it leaves the <code>myexp</code> function call in
  symbolic form. If we had answered <kbd>n</kbd> to the final
  question, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myexp(a +
  1)</span></samp>&rsquo; would have evaluated by plugging in
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + 1</span></samp>&rsquo; for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
  defining formula.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Sine-integral-Si_0028x_0029-71" id=
  "index-Sine-integral-Si_0028x_0029-71"></a><a name="index-Si-72"
  id="index-Si-72"></a>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> The
  &ldquo;sine integral&rdquo; function <!-- @math{{\rm Si}(x)} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Si(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  defined as the integral of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sin(t)/t</span></samp>&rsquo; for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t = 0</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; in
  radians. (It was invented because this integral has no solution
  in terms of basic functions; if you give it to Calc's <kbd>a
  i</kbd> command, it will ponder it for a long time and then give
  up.) We can use the numerical integration command, however, which
  in algebraic notation is written like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">ninteg(f(t), t, 0, x)</span></samp>&rsquo; with any
  integrand &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">f(t)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Define a <kbd>z s</kbd> command
  and <code>Si</code> function that implement this. You will need
  to edit the default argument list a bit. As a test,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Si(1)</span></samp>&rsquo; should
  return 0.946083. (If you don't get this answer, you might want to
  check that Calc is in Radians mode. Also, <code>ninteg</code>
  will run a lot faster if you reduce the precision to, say, six
  digits beforehand.) See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-1.html#Programming-Answer-1">1</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>The simplest way to do real &ldquo;programming&rdquo; of Emacs
  is to define a <dfn>keyboard macro</dfn>. A keyboard macro is
  simply a sequence of keystrokes which Emacs has stored away and
  can play back on demand. For example, if you find yourself typing
  <kbd>H a S x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> often, you may wish to program a
  keyboard macro to type this for you.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  y = sqrt(x)          1:  x = y^2
         .                        .

         ' y=sqrt(x) &lt;RET&gt;       C-x ( H a S x &lt;RET&gt; C-x )

     1:  y = cos(x)           1:  x = s1 arccos(y) + 2 pi n1
         .                        .

         ' y=cos(x) &lt;RET&gt;           X
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">When you type <kbd>C-x (</kbd>, Emacs begins
  recording. But it is also still ready to execute your keystrokes,
  so you're really &ldquo;training&rdquo; Emacs by walking it
  through the procedure once. When you type <kbd>C-x&nbsp;)</kbd>
  <!-- /@w -->, the macro is recorded. You can now type
  <kbd>X</kbd> to re-execute the same keystrokes.</p>

  <p>You can give a name to your macro by typing <kbd>Z
  K</kbd>.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  .              1:  y = x^4         1:  x = s2 sqrt(s1 sqrt(y))
                            .                   .

       Z K x &lt;RET&gt;            ' y=x^4 &lt;RET&gt;         z x
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Notice that we use shift-<kbd>Z</kbd> to
  define the command, and lower-case <kbd>z</kbd> to call it
  up.</p>

  <p>Keyboard macros can call other macros.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  abs(x)        1:  x = s1 y                1:  2 / x    1:  x = 2 / y
         .                 .                           .            .

      ' abs(x) &lt;RET&gt;   C-x ( ' y &lt;RET&gt; a = z x C-x )    ' 2/x &lt;RET&gt;       X
</pre>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Define a keyboard macro
  to negate the item in level 3 of the stack, without disturbing
  the rest of the stack. See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-2.html#Programming-Answer-2">2</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Define keyboard macros
  to compute the following functions:</p>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>Compute <!-- @math{\displaystyle{\sin x \over x}}, -->
     &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x) /
    x</span></samp>&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is the number on the top of the
    stack.</li>

    <li>Compute the base-&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; logarithm, just like the
    <kbd>B</kbd> key except the arguments are taken in the opposite
    order.</li>

    <li>Produce a vector of integers from 1 to the integer on the
    top of the stack.</li>
  </ol>See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-3.html#Programming-Answer-3">3</a>. (&bull;)

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Define a keyboard macro
  to compute the average (mean) value of a list of numbers. See
  <a href="Programming-Answer-4.html#Programming-Answer-4">4</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>In many programs, some of the steps must execute several
  times. Calc has <dfn>looping</dfn> commands that allow this.
  Loops are useful inside keyboard macros, but actually work at any
  time.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  x^6          2:  x^6        1: 360 x^2
         .            1:  4             .
                          .

       ' x^6 &lt;RET&gt;          4         Z &lt; a d x &lt;RET&gt; Z &gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Here we have computed the fourth derivative
  of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^6</span></samp>&rsquo; by
  enclosing a derivative command in a &ldquo;repeat loop&rdquo;
  structure. This structure pops a repeat count from the stack,
  then executes the body of the loop that many times.</p>

  <p>If you make a mistake while entering the body of the loop,
  type <kbd>Z&nbsp;C-g</kbd><!-- /@w --> to cancel the loop
  command.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Fibonacci-numbers-73" id=
  "index-Fibonacci-numbers-73"></a>Here's another example:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     3:  1               2:  10946
     2:  1               1:  17711
     1:  20                  .
         .

     1 &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt; 20       Z &lt; &lt;TAB&gt; C-j + Z &gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The numbers in levels 2 and 1 should be the
  21st and 22nd Fibonacci numbers, respectively. (To see what's
  going on, try a few repetitions of the loop body by hand;
  <kbd>C-j</kbd>, also on the Line-Feed or &lt;LFD&gt; key if you
  have one, makes a copy of the number in level 2.)</p>

  "index-Golden-ratio-74"></a><a name=
  "index-Phi_002c-golden-ratio-75" id=
  "index-Phi_002c-golden-ratio-75"></a>A fascinating property of
  the Fibonacci numbers is that the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;th Fibonacci number can be found
  directly by computing <!-- @math{\phi^n / \sqrt{5}} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phi^n /
  sqrt(5)</span></samp>&rsquo; and then rounding to the nearest
  integer, where <!-- @math{\phi} (``phi''), -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phi</span></samp>&rsquo;, the
  &ldquo;golden ratio,&rdquo; is
  <!-- @math{(1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2}. -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(1 + sqrt(5)) /
  2</span></samp>&rsquo;. (For convenience, this constant is
  available from the <code>phi</code> variable, or the <kbd>I H
  P</kbd> command.)</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  1.61803         1:  24476.0000409    1:  10945.9999817    1:  10946
         .                   .                    .                    .

         I H P               21 ^                 5 Q /                R
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-Continued-fractions-76" id=
  "index-Continued-fractions-76"></a>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise
  5.</strong> The <dfn>continued fraction</dfn> representation of
  <!-- @math{\phi} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phi</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  <!-- @math{1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/( \ldots )))}. -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/( ...
  )))</span></samp>&rsquo;. We can compute an approximate value by
  carrying this however far and then replacing the innermost
  <!-- @math{1/( \ldots )} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/( ... )</span></samp>&rsquo;
  by 1. Approximate <!-- @math{\phi} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phi</span></samp>&rsquo; using a
  twenty-term continued fraction. See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-5.html#Programming-Answer-5">5</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 6.</strong> Linear recurrences like
  the one for Fibonacci numbers can be expressed in terms of
  matrices. Given a vector &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[a,&nbsp;b]</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> determine a
  matrix which, when multiplied by this vector, produces the vector
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[b, c]</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; are three
  successive Fibonacci numbers. Now write a program that, given an
  integer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  computes the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;th Fibonacci number using matrix
  arithmetic. See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-6.html#Programming-Answer-6">6</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p><a name="index-Harmonic-numbers-77" id=
  "index-Harmonic-numbers-77"></a>A more sophisticated kind of loop
  is the <dfn>for</dfn> loop. Suppose we wish to compute the 20th
  &ldquo;harmonic&rdquo; number, which is equal to the sum of the
  reciprocals of the integers from 1 to 20.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     3:  0               1:  3.597739
     2:  1                   .
     1:  20
         .

     0 &lt;RET&gt; 1 &lt;RET&gt; 20         Z ( &amp; + 1 Z )
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop pops two numbers,
  the lower and upper limits, then repeats the body of the loop as
  an internal counter increases from the lower limit to the upper
  one. Just before executing the loop body, it pushes the current
  loop counter. When the loop body finishes, it pops the
  &ldquo;step,&rdquo; i.e., the amount by which to increment the
  loop counter. As you can see, our loop always uses a step of
  one.</p>

  <p>This harmonic number function uses the stack to hold the
  running total as well as for the various loop housekeeping
  functions. If you find this disorienting, you can sum in a
  variable instead:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  0         2:  1                  .            1:  3.597739
         .         1:  20                                  .
                       .

         0 t 7       1 &lt;RET&gt; 20      Z ( &amp; s + 7 1 Z )       r 7
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The <kbd>s +</kbd> command adds the
  top-of-stack into the value in a variable (and removes that value
  from the stack).</p>

  <p>It's worth noting that many jobs that call for a
  &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop can also be done more easily by Calc's
  high-level operations. Two other ways to compute harmonic numbers
  are to use vector mapping and reduction (<kbd>v x 20</kbd>, then
  <kbd>V&nbsp;M&nbsp;&amp;</kbd><!-- /@w -->, then <kbd>V R
  +</kbd>), or to use the summation command <kbd>a +</kbd>. Both of
  these are probably easier than using loops. However, there are
  some situations where loops really are the way to go:</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 7.</strong> Use a &ldquo;for&rdquo;
  loop to find the first harmonic number which is greater than 4.0.
  See <a href=
  "Programming-Answer-7.html#Programming-Answer-7">7</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>Of course, if we're going to be using variables in our
  programs, we have to worry about the programs clobbering values
  that the caller was keeping in those same variables. This is easy
  to fix, though:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
         .        1:  0.6667       1:  0.6667     3:  0.6667
                      .                .          2:  3.597739
                                                  1:  0.6667
                                                      .

        Z `    p 4 &lt;RET&gt; 2 &lt;RET&gt; 3 /   s 7 s s a &lt;RET&gt;    Z '  r 7 s r a &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">When we type <kbd>Z `</kbd> (that's a
  back-quote character), Calc saves its mode settings and the
  contents of the ten &ldquo;quick variables&rdquo; for later
  reference. When we type <kbd>Z '</kbd> (that's an apostrophe
  now), Calc restores those saved values. Thus the <kbd>p 4</kbd>
  and <kbd>s 7</kbd> commands have no effect outside this sequence.
  Wrapping this around the body of a keyboard macro ensures that it
  doesn't interfere with what the user of the macro was doing.
  Notice that the contents of the stack, and the values of named
  variables, survive past the <kbd>Z '</kbd> command.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Bernoulli-numbers_002c-approximate-78" id=
  "index-Bernoulli-numbers_002c-approximate-78"></a>The
  <dfn>Bernoulli numbers</dfn> are a sequence with the interesting
  property that all of the odd Bernoulli numbers are zero, and the
  even ones, while difficult to compute, can be roughly
  approximated by the formula
  <!-- @math{\displaystyle{2 n! \over (2 \pi)^n}}. -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 n! / (2
  pi)^n</span></samp>&rsquo;. Let's write a keyboard macro to
  compute (approximate) Bernoulli numbers. (Calc has a command,
  <kbd>k b</kbd>, to compute exact Bernoulli numbers, but this
  command is very slow for large &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; since the higher Bernoulli numbers
  are very large fractions.)</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  10               1:  0.0756823
         .                    .

         10     C-x ( &lt;RET&gt; 2 % Z [ &lt;DEL&gt; 0 Z : ' 2 $! / (2 pi)^$ &lt;RET&gt; = Z ] C-x )
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">You can read <kbd>Z [</kbd> as
  &ldquo;then,&rdquo; <kbd>Z :</kbd> as &ldquo;else,&rdquo; and
  <kbd>Z ]</kbd> as &ldquo;end-if.&rdquo; There is no need for an
  explicit &ldquo;if&rdquo; command. For the purposes of
  <kbd>Z&nbsp;[</kbd><!-- /@w -->, the condition is
  &ldquo;true&rdquo; if the value it pops from the stack is a
  nonzero number, or &ldquo;false&rdquo; if it pops zero or
  something that is not a number (like a formula). Here we take our

  <p class="noindent">The vertical-bar <kbd>|</kbd> is the
  vector-concatenation command. When we execute it, the list we are
  building will be in stack level 2 (initially this is an empty
  list), and the next Bernoulli number will be in level 1. The
  effect is to append the Bernoulli number onto the end of the
  list. (To create a table of exact fractional Bernoulli numbers,
  just replace <kbd>X</kbd> with <kbd>k b</kbd> in the above
  sequence of keystrokes.)</p>

  <p>With loops and conditionals, you can program essentially
  anything in Calc. One other command that makes looping easier is
  <kbd>Z /</kbd>, which takes a condition from the stack and breaks
  out of the enclosing loop if the condition is true (non-zero).
  You can use this to make &ldquo;while&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;until&rdquo; style loops.</p>

  <p>If you make a mistake when entering a keyboard macro, you can
  edit it using <kbd>Z E</kbd>. First, you must attach it to a key
  with <kbd>Z K</kbd>. One technique is to enter a throwaway dummy
  definition for the macro, then enter the real one in the edit
  command.</p>

  The <dfn>Stirling numbers of the first kind</dfn> are defined by

  <p>This can be implemented using a <dfn>recursive</dfn> program
  in Calc; the program must invoke itself in order to calculate the
  two righthand terms in the general formula. Since it always
  invokes itself with &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; arguments, it's easy to
  see that it must eventually finish the computation. Recursion is
  a little difficult with Emacs keyboard macros since the macro is
  executed before its definition is complete. So here's the
  recommended strategy: Create a &ldquo;dummy macro&rdquo; and
  assign it to a key with, e.g., <kbd>Z K s</kbd>. Now enter the
  true definition, using the <kbd>z s</kbd> command to call itself
  recursively, then assign it to the same key with <kbd>Z K
  s</kbd>. Now the <kbd>z s</kbd> command will run the complete
  recursive program. (Another way is to use <kbd>Z&nbsp;E</kbd>
  <!-- /@w -->

  whole macro at once, thus avoiding the &ldquo;training&rdquo;
