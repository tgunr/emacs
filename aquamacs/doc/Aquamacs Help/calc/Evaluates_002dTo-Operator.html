  <h3 class="section">13.5 The Evaluates-To Operator</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-evalto-2083" id=
  "index-evalto-2083"></a><a name="index-g_t_003d_003e-2084" id=
  "index-g_t_003d_003e-2084"></a><a name=

  "index-g_t_0040samp_007b_003d_003e_007d-operator-2086"></a>The
  special algebraic symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; is known as the
  <dfn>evaluates-to operator</dfn>. (It will show up as an
  <code>evalto</code> function call in other language modes like
  Pascal and LaTeX.) This is a binary operator, that is, it has a
  lefthand and a righthand argument, although it can be entered
  with the righthand argument omitted.</p>

  <p>A formula like &lsquo;<samp><var>a</var> <span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span> <var>b</var></samp>&rsquo; is evaluated by
  Calc as follows: First, <var>a</var> is not simplified or
  modified in any way. The previous value of argument <var>b</var>
  is thrown away; the formula <var>a</var> is then copied and
  evaluated as if by the <kbd>=</kbd> command according to all
  current modes and stored variable values, and the result is
  installed as the new value of <var>b</var>.</p>

  <p>For example, suppose you enter the algebraic formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 + 3 =&gt;
  17</span></samp>&rsquo;. The number 17 is ignored, and the
  lefthand argument is left in its unevaluated form; the result is
  the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 + 3 =&gt;
  5</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><a name="index-s-_003d-2087" id=
  "index-s-_003d-2087"></a><a name="index-calc_002devalto-2088" id=
  "index-calc_002devalto-2088"></a>You can enter an
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  formula either directly using algebraic entry (in which case the
  righthand side may be omitted since it is going to be replaced
  right away anyhow), or by using the <kbd>s =</kbd>
  (<code>calc-evalto</code>) command, which takes <var>a</var> from
  the stack and replaces it with &lsquo;<samp><var>a</var>
  <span class="samp">=&gt;</span> <var>b</var></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Calc keeps track of all &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operators on the stack, and
  recomputes them whenever anything changes that might affect their
  values, i.e., a mode setting or variable value. This occurs only
  if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operator is at the top level of the formula, or if it is part of
  a top-level vector. In other words, pushing
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 + (a =&gt;
  17)</span></samp>&rsquo; will change the 17 to the actual value
  of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; when
  you enter the formula, but the result will not be dynamically
  updated when &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; is changed later because the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operator is buried inside a sum. However, a vector of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operators will be recomputed, since it is convenient to push a
  vector like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a =&gt;, b =&gt;, c
  =&gt;]</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack to make a concise
  display of all the variables in your problem. (Another way to do
  this would be to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a, b, c]
  =&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, which provides a slightly different
  format of display. You can use whichever you find easiest to
  read.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-m-C-2089" id="index-m-C-2089"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dauto_002drecompute-2090" id=
  "index-calc_002dauto_002drecompute-2090"></a>The <kbd>m C</kbd>
  (<code>calc-auto-recompute</code>) command allows you to turn
  this automatic recomputation on or off. If you turn recomputation
  off, you must explicitly recompute an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator on the stack in one of
  the usual ways, such as by pressing <kbd>=</kbd>. Turning
  recomputation off temporarily can save a lot of time if you will
  be changing several modes or variables before you look at the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  entries again.</p>

  <p>Most commands are not especially useful with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operators as arguments. For example, given
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + 2 =&gt;
  17</span></samp>&rsquo;, it won't work to type <kbd>1 +</kbd> to
  get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + 3 =&gt;
  18</span></samp>&rsquo;. If you want to operate on the lefthand
  side of the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator on the top of the
  stack, type <kbd>j 1</kbd> (that's the digit &ldquo;one&rdquo;)
  to select the lefthand side, execute your commands, then type
  <kbd>j u</kbd> to unselect.</p>

  <p>All current modes apply when an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator is computed, including
  the current simplification mode. Recall that the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + x</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  not handled by Calc's default simplifications, but the <kbd>a
  s</kbd> command will reduce it to the simpler form
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y + 2 x</span></samp>&rsquo;. You
  can also type <kbd>m A</kbd> to enable an Algebraic
  Simplification mode in which the equivalent of <kbd>a s</kbd> is
  used on all of Calc's results. If you enter
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + x
  =&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; normally, the result will be
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + x =&gt; x + y +
  x</span></samp>&rsquo;. If you change to Algebraic Simplification
  mode, the result will be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y +
  x =&gt; y + 2 x</span></samp>&rsquo;. However, just pressing
  <kbd>a s</kbd> once will have no effect on
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + x =&gt; x + y +
  x</span></samp>&rsquo;, because the righthand side depends only
  on the lefthand side and the current mode settings, and the
  lefthand side is not affected by commands like <kbd>a
  s</kbd>.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;let&rdquo; command (<kbd>s l</kbd>) has an
  interesting interaction with the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator. The <kbd>s l</kbd>
  command evaluates the second-to-top stack entry with the top
  stack entry supplying a temporary value for a given variable. As
  you might expect, if that stack entry is an
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operator its righthand side will temporarily show this value for
  the variable. In fact, all &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;s on the stack will be updated
  if they refer to that variable. But this change is temporary in
  the sense that the next command that causes Calc to look at those
  stack entries will make them revert to the old variable
  value.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  a =&gt; a             2:  a =&gt; 17         2:  a =&gt; a
     1:  a + 1 =&gt; a + 1     1:  a + 1 =&gt; 18     1:  a + 1 =&gt; a + 1
         .                      .                   .

                                17 s l a &lt;RET&gt;        p 8 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Here the <kbd>p 8</kbd> command changes the current precision,
  thus causing the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; forms to be recomputed after
  the influence of the &ldquo;let&rdquo; is gone. The <kbd>d
  &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> command (<code>calc-refresh</code>) is a handy
  way to force the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operators on the stack to be
  recomputed without any other side effects.</p>

  "index-g_t_003a_003d-2094"></a>Embedded mode also uses
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operators. In Embedded mode, the lefthand side of an
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operator can refer to variables assigned elsewhere in the file by
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operators. The assignment operator &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a := 17</span></samp>&rsquo; does not actually do anything
  by itself. But Embedded mode recognizes it and marks it as a sort
  of file-local definition of the variable. You can enter
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; operators
  in Algebraic mode, or by using the <kbd>s :</kbd>
  (<code>calc-assign</code>) [<code>assign</code>] command which
  takes a variable and value from the stack and replaces them with
  an assignment.</p>

  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  appears in TeX language output. The <dfn>eqn</dfn> mode gives
  similar treatment to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
