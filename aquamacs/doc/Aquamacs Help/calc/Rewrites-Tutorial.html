  <h4 class="subsection">3.5.2 Rewrite Rules</h4>

  <p class="noindent">No matter how many built-in commands Calc
  provided for doing algebra, there would always be something you
  wanted to do that Calc didn't have in its repertoire. So Calc
  also provides a <dfn>rewrite rule</dfn> system that you can use
  to define your own algebraic manipulations.</p>

  <p>Suppose we want to simplify this trigonometric formula:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2 / cos(x)^2 - 2 tan(x)^2
         .

         ' 2/cos(x)^2 - 2tan(x)^2 &lt;RET&gt;   s 1
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">If we were simplifying this by hand, we'd
  probably replace the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">tan</span></samp>&rsquo; with a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sin/cos</span></samp>&rsquo; first, then combine over a
  common denominator. The <kbd>I a s</kbd> command will do the
  former and the <kbd>a n</kbd> algebra command will do the latter,
  but we'll do both with rewrite rules just for practice.</p>

  <p>Rewrite rules are written with the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2 / cos(x)^2 - 2 sin(x)^2 / cos(x)^2
         .

         a r tan(a) := sin(a)/cos(a) &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(The &ldquo;assignment operator&rdquo;
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; has
  several uses in Calc. All by itself the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tan(a) :=
  sin(a)/cos(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; doesn't do anything, but when
  it is given to the <kbd>a r</kbd> command, that command
  interprets it as a rewrite rule.)</p>

  <p>The lefthand side, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">tan(a)</span></samp>&rsquo;, is called the
  <dfn>pattern</dfn> of the rewrite rule. Calc searches the formula
  on the stack for parts that match the pattern. Variables in a
  rewrite pattern are called <dfn>meta-variables</dfn>, and when
  matching the pattern each meta-variable can match any
  sub-formula. Here, the meta-variable &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; matched the actual variable
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>When the pattern part of a rewrite rule matches a part of the
  formula, that part is replaced by the righthand side with all the
  meta-variables substituted with the things they matched. So the
  result is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x) /
  cos(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Calc's normal algebraic
  simplifications then mix this in with the rest of the original
  formula.</p>

  <p>To merge over a common denominator, we can use another simple
  rule:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  (2 - 2 sin(x)^2) / cos(x)^2
         .

         a r a/x + b/x := (a+b)/x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p>This rule points out several interesting features of rewrite
  patterns. First, if a meta-variable appears several times in a
  pattern, it must match the same thing everywhere. This rule
  detects common denominators because the same meta-variable
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is used in
  both of the denominators.</p>

  <p>Second, meta-variable names are independent from variables in
  the target formula. Notice that the meta-variable
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; here
  matches the subformula &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">cos(x)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;; Calc never confuses the two
  meanings of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>And third, rewrite patterns know a little bit about the
  algebraic properties of formulas. The pattern called for a sum of
  two quotients; Calc was able to match a difference of two
  quotients by matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a =
  2</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b = -2
  sin(x)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x = cos(x)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  <!-- [fix-ref Algebraic Properties of Rewrite Rules] --></p>

  <p>We could just as easily have written &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a/x - b/x := (a-b)/x</span></samp>&rsquo; for the rule. It
  would have worked just the same in all cases. (If we really
  wanted the rule to apply only to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; or only to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, we could
  have used the <code>plain</code> symbol. See <a href=
  "Algebraic-Properties-of-Rewrite-Rules.html#Algebraic-Properties-of-Rewrite-Rules">
  Algebraic Properties of Rewrite Rules</a>, for some examples of
  this.)</p>

  <p>One more rewrite will complete the job. We want to use the
  identity &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 =
  1</span></samp>&rsquo;, but of course we must first rearrange the
  identity in a way that matches our formula. The obvious rule
  would be &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2&nbsp;-&nbsp;2&nbsp;sin(x)^2<!-- /@w --> := 2
  cos(x)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;, but a little thought shows that
  the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x)^2 := 1 -
  cos(x)^2</span></samp>&rsquo; will also work. The latter rule has
  a more general pattern so it will work in many other situations,
  too.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  (2 + 2 cos(x)^2 - 2) / cos(x)^2           1:  2
         .                                            .

         a r sin(x)^2 := 1 - cos(x)^2 &lt;RET&gt;          a s
</pre>

  <p>You may ask, what's the point of using the most general rule
  if you have to type it in every time anyway? The answer is that
  Calc allows you to store a rewrite rule in a variable, then give
  the variable name in the <kbd>a r</kbd> command. In fact, this is
  the preferred way to use rewrites. For one, if you need a rule
  once you'll most likely need it again later. Also, if the rule
  doesn't work quite right you can simply Undo, edit the variable,
  and run the rule again without having to retype it.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     ' tan(x) := sin(x)/cos(x) &lt;RET&gt;      s t tsc &lt;RET&gt;
     ' a/x + b/x := (a+b)/x &lt;RET&gt;         s t merge &lt;RET&gt;
     ' sin(x)^2 := 1 - cos(x)^2 &lt;RET&gt;     s t sinsqr &lt;RET&gt;

     1:  2 / cos(x)^2 - 2 tan(x)^2      1:  2
         .                                  .

         r 1                a r tsc &lt;RET&gt;  a r merge &lt;RET&gt;  a r sinsqr &lt;RET&gt;  a s
</pre>

  <p>To edit a variable, type <kbd>s e</kbd> and the variable name,
  use regular Emacs editing commands as necessary, then type
  <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to store the edited value back into the
  variable. You can also use <kbd>s&nbsp;e</kbd><!-- /@w --> to
  create a new variable if you wish.</p>

  <p>Notice that the first time you use each rule, Calc puts up a
  &ldquo;compiling&rdquo; message briefly. The pattern matcher
  converts rules into a special optimized pattern-matching language
  rather than using them directly. This allows <kbd>a r</kbd> to
  apply even rather complicated rules very efficiently. If the rule
  is stored in a variable, Calc compiles it only once and stores
  the compiled form along with the variable. That's another good
  reason to store your rules in variables rather than entering them
  on the fly.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Type <kbd>m s</kbd> to
  get Symbolic mode, then enter the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(2&nbsp;+&nbsp;sqrt(2))
  <!-- /@w --> / (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;sqrt(2))
  <!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;. Using a rewrite rule, simplify
  this formula by multiplying the top and bottom by the conjugate
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1&nbsp;-&nbsp;sqrt(2)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.
  The result will have to be expanded by the distributive law; do
  this with another rewrite. See <a href=
  "Rewrites-Answer-1.html#Rewrites-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>The <kbd>a r</kbd> command can also accept a vector of rewrite
  rules, or a variable containing a vector of rules.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [tsc, merge, sinsqr]          1:  [tan(x) := sin(x) / cos(x), ... ]
         .                                 .

         ' [tsc,merge,sinsqr] &lt;RET&gt;          =
</pre>

  <p class="noindent"></p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  1 / cos(x) - sin(x) tan(x)    1:  cos(x)
         .                                 .

         s t trig &lt;RET&gt;  r 1                 a r trig &lt;RET&gt;  a s
</pre><!-- [fix-ref Nested Formulas with Rewrite Rules] -->

  <p>Calc tries all the rules you give against all parts of the
  formula, repeating until no further change is possible. (The
  exact order in which things are tried is rather complex, but for
  simple rules like the ones we've used here the order doesn't
  really matter. See <a href=
  "Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules.html#Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules">
  Nested Formulas with Rewrite Rules</a>.)</p>

  <p>Calc actually repeats only up to 100 times, just in case your
  rule set has gotten into an infinite loop. You can give a numeric
  prefix argument to <kbd>a r</kbd> to specify any limit. In
  particular, <kbd>M-1 a r</kbd> does only one rewrite at a
  time.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  1 / cos(x) - sin(x)^2 / cos(x)    1:  (1 - sin(x)^2) / cos(x)
         .                                     .

         r 1  M-1 a r trig &lt;RET&gt;                 M-1 a r trig &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p>You can type <kbd>M-0 a r</kbd> if you want no limit at all on
  the number of rewrites that occur.</p>

  <p>Rewrite rules can also be <dfn>conditional</dfn>. Simply
  follow the rule with a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol and the desired condition.
  For example,</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  exp(2 pi i) + exp(3 pi i) + exp(4 pi i)
         .

         ' exp(2 pi i) + exp(3 pi i) + exp(4 pi i) &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent"></p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  1 + exp(3 pi i) + 1
         .

         a r exp(k pi i) := 1 :: k % 2 = 0 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(Recall, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k %
  2</span></samp>&rsquo; is the remainder from dividing
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo; by 2,
  which will be zero only when &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo; is an even integer.)</p>

  <p>An interesting point is that the variables
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pi</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; were
  matched literally rather than acting as meta-variables. This is
  because they are special-constant variables. The special
  constants &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phi</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so
  on also match literally. A common error with rewrite rules is to
  write, say, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(a,b,c,d,e) :=
  g(a+b+c+d+e)</span></samp>&rsquo;, expecting to match any
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; with five
  arguments but in fact matching only when the fifth argument is
  literally &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo;!</p>

  <p><a name="index-Fibonacci-numbers-69" id=
  "index-Fibonacci-numbers-69"></a><a name="index-fib-70" id=
  "index-fib-70"></a>Rewrite rules provide an interesting way to
  define your own functions. Suppose we want to define
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fib(n)</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  produce the <var>n</var>th Fibonacci number. The first two
  Fibonacci numbers are each 1; later numbers are formed by summing
  the two preceding numbers in the sequence. This is easy to
  express in a set of three rules:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     ' [fib(1) := 1, fib(2) := 1, fib(n) := fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)] &lt;RET&gt;  s t fib

     1:  fib(7)               1:  13
         .                        .

         ' fib(7) &lt;RET&gt;             a r fib &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p>One thing that is guaranteed about the order that rewrites are
  tried is that, for any given subformula, earlier rules in the
  rule set will be tried for that subformula before later ones. So
  even though the first and third rules both match
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fib(1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, we
  know the first will be used preferentially.</p>

  <p>This rule set has one dangerous bug: Suppose we apply it to
  the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fib(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;? (Don't actually try this.)
  The third rule will match &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fib(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; and replace it with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fib(x-1)&nbsp;+&nbsp;fib(x-2)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  <!-- /@w -->. Each of these will then be replaced to get
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fib(x-2) + 2 fib(x-3) +
  fib(x-4)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on, expanding forever. What
  we really want is to apply the third rule only when
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; is an
  integer greater than two. Type
  <kbd>s&nbsp;e&nbsp;fib&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><!-- /@w -->, then
  edit the third rule to:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     fib(n) := fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) :: integer(n) :: n &gt; 2
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Now:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  fib(6) + fib(x) + fib(0)      1:  8 + fib(x) + fib(0)
         .                                 .

         ' fib(6)+fib(x)+fib(0) &lt;RET&gt;        a r fib &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">We've created a new function,
  <code>fib</code>, and a new command,
  <kbd>a&nbsp;r&nbsp;fib&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><!-- /@w -->, which
  means &ldquo;evaluate all <code>fib</code> calls in this
  formula.&rdquo; To make things easier still, we can tell Calc to
  apply these rules automatically by storing them in the special
  variable <code>EvalRules</code>.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [fib(1) := ...]    .                1:  [8, 13]
         .                                       .

         s r fib &lt;RET&gt;        s t EvalRules &lt;RET&gt;    ' [fib(6), fib(7)] &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p>It turns out that this rule set has the problem that it does
  far more work than it needs to when &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; is large. Consider the first few
  steps of the computation of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fib(6)</span></samp>&rsquo;:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     fib(6) =
     fib(5)              +               fib(4) =
     fib(4)     +      fib(3)     +      fib(3)     +      fib(2) =
     fib(3) + fib(2) + fib(2) + fib(1) + fib(2) + fib(1) + 1 = ...
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fib(3)</span></samp>&rsquo; appears three times here.
  Unless Calc's algebraic simplifier notices the multiple
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fib(3)</span></samp>&rsquo;s and
  combines them (and, as it happens, it doesn't), this rule set
  does lots of needless recomputation. To cure the problem, type
  <code>s e EvalRules</code> to edit the rules (or just <kbd>s
  E</kbd>, a shorthand command for editing <code>EvalRules</code>)
  and add another condition:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     fib(n) := fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) :: integer(n) :: n &gt; 2 :: remember
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">If a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">::
  remember</span></samp>&rsquo; condition appears anywhere in a
  rule, then if that rule succeeds Calc will add another rule that
  describes that match to the front of the rule set. (Remembering
  works in any rule set, but for technical reasons it is most
  effective in <code>EvalRules</code>.) For example, if the rule
  rewrites &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fib(7)</span></samp>&rsquo; to something that evaluates to
  13, then the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fib(7) :=
  13</span></samp>&rsquo; will be added to the rule set.</p>

  <p>Type <kbd>' fib(8) &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to compute the eighth
  Fibonacci number, then type <kbd>s E</kbd> again to see what has
  happened to the rule set.</p>

  <p>With the <code>remember</code> feature, our rule set can now
  compute &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fib(</span><var>n</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; in just <var>n</var> steps. In the
  process it builds up a table of all Fibonacci numbers up to
  <var>n</var>. After we have computed the result for a particular
  <var>n</var>, we can get it back (and the results for all smaller
  <var>n</var>) later in just one step.</p>

  <p>All Calc operations will run somewhat slower whenever
  <code>EvalRules</code> contains any rules. You should type <kbd>s
  u EvalRules &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> now to un-store the variable.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Sometimes it is possible
  to reformulate a problem to reduce the amount of recursion
  necessary to solve it. Create a rule that, in about <var>n</var>
  simple steps and without recourse to the <code>remember</code>
  option, replaces &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fib(</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">, 1,
  1)</span></samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fib(1,</span> <var>x</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>y</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; where
  <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are the <var>n</var>th and
  <var>n+1</var>st Fibonacci numbers, respectively. This rule is
  rather clunky to use, so add a couple more rules to make the
  &ldquo;user interface&rdquo; the same as for our first version:
  enter &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">fib(</span><var>n</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, get back a plain number. See
  <a href="Rewrites-Answer-2.html#Rewrites-Answer-2">2</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>There are many more things that rewrites can do. For example,
  there are &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&amp;&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo; pattern
  operators that create &ldquo;and&rdquo; and &ldquo;or&rdquo;
  combinations of rules. As one really simple example, we could
  combine our first two Fibonacci rules thusly:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     [fib(1 ||| 2) := 1, fib(n) := ... ]
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">That means &ldquo;<code>fib</code> of
  something matching either 1 or 2 rewrites to 1.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>You can also make meta-variables optional by enclosing them in
  <code>opt</code>. For example, the pattern
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b x</span></samp>&rsquo;
  matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 + 3
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; but not &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2
  + x</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. The pattern
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">opt(a) + opt(b)
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; matches all of these forms, filling in a
  default of zero for &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; and one for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Your friend Joe had
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 + 3 x</span></samp>&rsquo; on
  the stack and tried to use the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">opt(a) + opt(b) x := f(a, b, x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. What
  happened? See <a href=
  "Rewrites-Answer-3.html#Rewrites-Answer-3">3</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Starting with a positive
  integer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  divide &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; by
  two if it is even, otherwise compute &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">3 a + 1</span></samp>&rsquo;. Now repeat this step over
  and over. A famous unproved conjecture is that for any starting
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;, the
  sequence always eventually reaches 1. Given the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">seq(</span><var>a</var><span class="samp">,
  0)</span></samp>&rsquo;, write a set of rules that convert this
  into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">seq(1,</span>
  <var>n</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; where
  <var>n</var> is the number of steps it took the sequence to reach
  the value 1. Now enhance the rules to accept
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">seq(</span><var>a</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; as a starting configuration, and to
  stop with just the number <var>n</var> by itself. Now make the
  result be a vector of values in the sequence, from <var>a</var>
  to 1. (The formula &lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class=
  "samp">|</span><var>y</var></samp>&rsquo; appends the vectors
  <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>.) For example, rewriting
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">seq(6)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  should yield the vector &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[6, 3,
  10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]</span></samp>&rsquo;. See <a href=
  "Rewrites-Answer-4.html#Rewrites-Answer-4">4</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 5.</strong> Define, using rewrite
  rules, a function &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">nterms(</span><var>x</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; that returns the number of terms in
  the sum <var>x</var>, or 1 if <var>x</var> is not a sum. (A
  <dfn>sum</dfn> for our purposes is one or more non-sum terms
  separated by &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; signs, so that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 - 3 (x + y) + x
  y</span></samp>&rsquo; is a sum of three terms.) See <a href=
  "Rewrites-Answer-5.html#Rewrites-Answer-5">5</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 6.</strong> A Taylor series for a
  function is an infinite series that exactly equals the value of
  that function at values of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; near zero.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     cos(x) = 1 - x^2 / 2! + x^4 / 4! - x^6 / 6! + ...
</pre>

  <p>The <kbd>a t</kbd> command produces a <dfn>truncated Taylor
  series</dfn> which is obtained by dropping all the terms higher
  than, say, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo;. Calc represents the truncated
  Taylor series as a polynomial in &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. Mathematicians often write a
  truncated series using a &ldquo;big-O&rdquo; notation that
  records what was the lowest term that was truncated.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     cos(x) = 1 - x^2 / 2! + O(x^3)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The meaning of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">O(x^3)</span></samp>&rsquo; is &ldquo;a quantity which is
  negligibly small if &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^3</span></samp>&rsquo; is considered negligibly small as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; goes to
  zero.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The exercise is to create rewrite rules that simplify sums and
  products of power series represented as
  &lsquo;<samp><var>polynomial</var> <span class="samp">+
  O(</span><var>var</var><span class=
  "samp">^</span><var>n</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;. For example, given
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 - x^2 / 2 +
  O(x^3)</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x
  - x^3 / 6 + O(x^4)</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack, we want to
  be able to type <kbd>*</kbd> and get the result
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x - 2:3 x^3 +
  O(x^4)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Don't worry if the terms of the sum
  are rearranged or if <kbd>a s</kbd> needs to be typed after
  rewriting. (This one is rather tricky; the solution at the end of
  this chapter uses 6 rewrite rules. Hint: The
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">constant(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  condition tests whether &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is a number.) See <a href=
  "Rewrites-Answer-6.html#Rewrites-Answer-6">6</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>Just for kicks, try adding the rule <code>2+3 := 6</code> to
  <code>EvalRules</code>. What happens? (Be sure to remove this
  rule afterward, or you might get a nasty surprise when you use
  Calc to balance your checkbook!)</p>
