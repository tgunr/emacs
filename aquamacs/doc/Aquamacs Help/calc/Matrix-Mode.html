  <h4 class="subsection">7.4.6 Matrix and Scalar Modes</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-Matrix-mode-434" id=
  "index-Matrix-mode-434"></a><a name="index-Scalar-mode-435" id=
  "index-Scalar-mode-435"></a>Calc sometimes makes assumptions
  during algebraic manipulation that are awkward or incorrect when
  vectors and matrices are involved. Calc has two modes,
  <dfn>Matrix mode</dfn> and <dfn>Scalar mode</dfn>, which modify
  its behavior around vectors in useful ways.</p>

  <p><a name="index-m-v-436" id="index-m-v-436"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dmatrix_002dmode-437" id=
  "index-calc_002dmatrix_002dmode-437"></a>Press <kbd>m v</kbd>
  (<code>calc-matrix-mode</code>) once to enter Matrix mode. In
  this mode, all objects are assumed to be matrices unless provably
  otherwise. One major effect is that Calc will no longer consider
  multiplication to be commutative. (Recall that in matrix
  arithmetic, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">A*B</span></samp>&rsquo; is not the same as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B*A</span></samp>&rsquo;.) This
  assumption affects rewrite rules and algebraic simplification.
  Another effect of this mode is that calculations that would
  normally produce constants like 0 and 1 (e.g.,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a - a</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a / a</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  respectively) will now produce function calls that represent
  &ldquo;generic&rdquo; zero or identity matrices:
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idn(0)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idn(1)</span></samp>&rsquo;. The
  <code>idn</code> function &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">idn(</span><var>a</var><span class=
  "samp">,</span><var>n</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; returns <var>a</var> times an
  <var>n</var>x<var>n</var> identity matrix; if <var>n</var> is
  omitted, it doesn't know what dimension to use and so the
  <code>idn</code> call remains in symbolic form. However, if this
  generic identity matrix is later combined with a matrix whose
  size is known, it will be converted into a true identity matrix
  of the appropriate size. On the other hand, if it is combined
  with a scalar (as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idn(1) +
  2</span></samp>&rsquo;), Calc will assume it really was a scalar
  after all and produce, e.g., 3.</p>

  <p>Press <kbd>m v</kbd> a second time to get Scalar mode. Here,
  objects are assumed <em>not</em> to be vectors or matrices unless
  provably so. For example, normally adding a variable to a vector,
  as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[x, y, z] +
  a</span></samp>&rsquo;, will leave the sum in symbolic form
  because as far as Calc knows, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; could represent either a number or
  another 3-vector. In Scalar mode, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; is assumed to be a non-vector, and
  the addition is evaluated to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[x+a, y+a, z+a]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Press <kbd>m v</kbd> a third time to return to the normal mode
  of operation.</p>

  <p>If you press <kbd>m v</kbd> with a numeric prefix argument
  <var>n</var>, you get a special &ldquo;dimensioned&rdquo; Matrix
  mode in which matrices of unknown size are assumed to be
  <var>n</var>x<var>n</var> square matrices. Then, the function
  call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idn(1)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  will expand into an actual matrix rather than representing a
  &ldquo;generic&rdquo; matrix. Simply typing <kbd>C-u m v</kbd>
  will get you a square Matrix mode, in which matrices of unknown
  size are assumed to be square matrices of unspecified size.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Declaring-scalar-variables-438" id=
  "index-Declaring-scalar-variables-438"></a>Of course these modes
  are approximations to the true state of affairs, which is
  probably that some quantities will be matrices and others will be
  scalars. One solution is to &ldquo;declare&rdquo; certain
  variables or functions to be scalar-valued. See <a href=
  "Declarations.html#Declarations">Declarations</a>, to see how to
  make declarations in Calc.</p>

  <p>There is nothing stopping you from declaring a variable to be
  scalar and then storing a matrix in it; however, if you do, the
  results you get from Calc may not be valid. Suppose you let Calc
  get the result &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[x+a, y+a,
  z+a]</span></samp>&rsquo; shown above, and then stored
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1, 2, 3]</span></samp>&rsquo; in
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;. The
  result would not be the same as for &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[x, y, z] + [1, 2, 3]</span></samp>&rsquo;, but that's
  because you have broken your earlier promise to Calc that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; would be
  scalar.</p>

  <p>Another way to mix scalars and matrices is to use selections
  (see <a href=
  "Selecting-Subformulas.html#Selecting-Subformulas">Selecting
  Subformulas</a>). Use Matrix mode when operating on your formula
  normally; then, to apply Scalar mode to a certain part of the
  formula without affecting the rest just select that part, change
  into Scalar mode and press <kbd>=</kbd> to resimplify the part
  under this mode, then change back to Matrix mode before
  deselecting.</p>
