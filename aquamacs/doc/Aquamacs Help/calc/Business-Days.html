  <h4 class="subsection">8.5.3 Business Days</h4>

  <p class="noindent">Often time is measured in &ldquo;business
  days&rdquo; or &ldquo;working days,&rdquo; where weekends and
  holidays are skipped. Calc's normal date arithmetic functions use
  calendar days, so that subtracting two consecutive Mondays will
  yield a difference of 7 days. By contrast, subtracting two
  consecutive Mondays would yield 5 business days (assuming two-day
  weekends and the absence of holidays).</p>

  "index-calc_002dbusiness_002ddays_002dminus-847"></a>The <kbd>t
  +</kbd> (<code>calc-business-days-plus</code>)
  [<code>badd</code>] and <kbd>t -</kbd>
  (<code>calc-business-days-minus</code>) [<code>bsub</code>]
  commands perform arithmetic using business days. For <kbd>t
  +</kbd>, one argument must be a date form and the other must be a
  real number (positive or negative). If the number is not an
  integer, then a certain amount of time is added as well as a
  number of days; for example, adding 0.5 business days to a time
  in Friday evening will produce a time in Monday morning. It is
  also possible to add an HMS form; adding
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12@ 0' 0"</span></samp>&rsquo;
  also adds half a business day. For <kbd>t -</kbd>, the arguments
  are either a date form and a number or HMS form, or two date
  forms, in which case the result is the number of business days
  between the two dates.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bHolidays_007d-variable-848"
  id="index-g_t_0040code_007bHolidays_007d-variable-848"></a><a name="index-Holidays-849"
  id="index-Holidays-849"></a>By default, Calc considers any day
  that is not a Saturday or Sunday to be a business day. You can
  define any number of additional holidays by editing the variable
  <code>Holidays</code>. (There is an <kbd>s&nbsp;H</kbd>
  <!-- /@w --> convenience command for editing this variable.)
  Initially, <code>Holidays</code> contains the vector
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[sat, sun]</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  Entries in the <code>Holidays</code> vector may be any of the
  following kinds of objects:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Date forms (pure dates, not date/time forms). These specify
    particular days which are to be treated as holidays.</li>

    <li>Intervals of date forms. These specify a range of days, all
    of which are holidays (e.g., Christmas week). See <a href=
    "Interval-Forms.html#Interval-Forms">Interval Forms</a>.</li>

    <li>Nested vectors of date forms. Each date form in the vector
    is considered to be a holiday.</li>

    <li>Any Calc formula which evaluates to one of the above three
    things. If the formula involves the variable
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;, it
    stands for a yearly repeating holiday;
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; will
    take on various year numbers like 1992. For example,
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">date(y, 12,
    25)</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies Christmas day, and
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">newweek(date(y, 11, 7), 4) +
    21</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies Thanksgiving (which is held
    on the fourth Thursday of November). If the formula involves
    the variable &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo;, that variable takes on month
    numbers from 1 to 12: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">date(y,
    m, 15)</span></samp>&rsquo; is a holiday that takes place on
    the 15th of every month.</li>

    <li>A weekday name, such as <code>sat</code> or
    <code>sun</code>. This is really a variable whose name is a
    three-letter, lower-case day name.</li>

    <li>An interval of year numbers (integers). This specifies the
    span of years over which this holiday list is to be considered
    valid. Any business-day arithmetic that goes outside this range
    will result in an error message. Use this if you are including
    an explicit list of holidays, rather than a formula to generate
    them, and you want to make sure you don't accidentally go
    beyond the last point where the holidays you entered are
    complete. If there is no limiting interval in the
    <code>Holidays</code> vector, the default
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1 ..
    2737]</span></samp>&rsquo; is used. (This is the absolute range
    of years for which Calc's business-day algorithms will
    operate.)</li>

    <li>An interval of HMS forms. This specifies the span of hours
    that are to be considered one business day. For example, if
    this range is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[9@ 0' 0" .. 17@
    0' 0"]</span></samp>&rsquo; (i.e., 9am to 5pm), then the
    business day is only eight hours long, so that <kbd>1.5 t
    +</kbd> on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;4:00pm Fri Dec
    13, 1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; will add one business day and
    four business hours to produce &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">&lt;12:00pm Tue Dec 17, 1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.
    Likewise, <kbd>t -</kbd> will now express differences in time
    as fractions of an eight-hour day. Times before 9am will be
    treated as 9am by business date arithmetic, and times at or
    after 5pm will be treated as 4:59:59pm. If there is no HMS
    interval in <code>Holidays</code>, the full 24-hour day
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0 0' 0" .. 24 0'
    0"]</span></samp>&rsquo; is assumed. (Regardless of the type of
    bounds you specify, the interval is treated as inclusive on the
    low end and exclusive on the high end, so that the work day
    goes from 9am up to, but not including, 5pm.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If the <code>Holidays</code> vector is empty, then <kbd>t
  +</kbd> and <kbd>t -</kbd> will act just like <kbd>+</kbd> and
  <kbd>-</kbd> because there will then be no difference between
  business days and calendar days.</p>

  <p>Calc expands the intervals and formulas you give into a
  complete list of holidays for internal use. This is done mainly
  to make sure it can detect multiple holidays. (For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Jan 1,
  1989&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; is both New Year's Day and a
  Sunday, but Calc's algorithms take care to count it only once
  when figuring the number of holidays between two dates.)</p>

  <p>Since the complete list of holidays for all the years from 1
  to 2737 would be huge, Calc actually computes only the part of
  the list between the smallest and largest years that have been
  involved in business-day calculations so far. Normally, you won't
  have to worry about this. Keep in mind, however, that if you do
  one calculation for 1992, and another for 1792, even if both
  involve only a small range of years, Calc will still work out all
  the holidays that fall in that 200-year span.</p>

  <p>If you add a (positive) number of days to a date form that
  falls on a weekend or holiday, the date form is treated as if it
  were the most recent business day. (Thus adding one business day
  to a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday will all yield the following
  Monday.) If you subtract a number of days from a weekend or
  holiday, the date is effectively on the following business day.
  (So subtracting one business day from Saturday, Sunday, or Monday
  yields the preceding Friday.) The difference between two dates
  one or both of which fall on holidays equals the number of actual
  business days between them. These conventions are consistent in
  the sense that, if you add <var>n</var> business days to any
  date, the difference between the result and the original date
  will come out to <var>n</var> business days. (It can't be
  completely consistent though; a subtraction followed by an
  addition might come out a bit differently, since <kbd>t +</kbd>
  is incapable of producing a date that falls on a weekend or
  holiday.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-holiday-850" id="index-holiday-850"></a>There
  is a <code>holiday</code> function, not on any keys, that takes
  any date form and returns 1 if that date falls on a weekend or
  holiday, as defined in <code>Holidays</code>, or 0 if the date is
  a business day.</p>
