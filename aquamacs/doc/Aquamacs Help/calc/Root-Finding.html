  "index-Numerical-root_002dfinding-1790" id=
  "index-Numerical-root_002dfinding-1790"></a>The <kbd>a R</kbd>
  (<code>calc-find-root</code>) [<code>root</code>] command finds a
  numerical solution (or <dfn>root</dfn>) of an equation. (This
  command treats inequalities the same as equations. If the input
  is any other kind of formula, it is interpreted as an equation of
  the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X =
  0</span></samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  <p>The <kbd>a R</kbd> command requires an initial guess on the
  top of the stack, and a formula in the second-to-top position. It
  prompts for a solution variable, which must appear in the
  formula. All other variables that appear in the formula must have
  assigned values, i.e., when a value is assigned to the solution
  variable and the formula is evaluated with <kbd>=</kbd>, it
  should evaluate to a number. Any assigned value for the solution
  variable itself is ignored and unaffected by this command.</p>

  <p>When the command completes, the initial guess is replaced on
  the stack by a vector of two numbers: The value of the solution
  variable that solves the equation, and the difference between the
  lefthand and righthand sides of the equation at that value.
  Ordinarily, the second number will be zero or very nearly zero.
  (Note that Calc uses a slightly higher precision while finding
  the root, and thus the second number may be slightly different
  from the value you would compute from the equation yourself.)</p>

  <p>The <kbd>v h</kbd> (<code>calc-head</code>) command is a handy
  way to extract the first element of the result vector, discarding
  the error term.</p>

  <p>The initial guess can be a real number, in which case Calc
  searches for a real solution near that number, or a complex
  number, in which case Calc searches the whole complex plane near
  that number for a solution, or it can be an interval form which
  restricts the search to real numbers inside that interval.</p>

  <p>Calc tries to use <kbd>a d</kbd> to take the derivative of the
  equation. If this succeeds, it uses Newton's method. If the
  equation is not differentiable Calc uses a bisection method. (If
  Newton's method appears to be going astray, Calc switches over to
  bisection if it can, or otherwise gives up. In this case it may
  help to try again with a slightly different initial guess.) If
  the initial guess is a complex number, the function must be
  differentiable.</p>

  <p>If the formula (or the difference between the sides of an
  equation) is negative at one end of the interval you specify and
  positive at the other end, the root finder is guaranteed to find
  a root. Otherwise, Calc subdivides the interval into small parts
  looking for positive and negative values to bracket the root.
  When your guess is an interval, Calc will not look outside that
  interval for a root.</p>

  <p><a name="index-H-a-R-1791" id="index-H-a-R-1791"></a><a name=
  "index-wroot-1792" id="index-wroot-1792"></a>The <kbd>H a R</kbd>
  [<code>wroot</code>] command is similar to <kbd>a R</kbd>, except
  that if the initial guess is an interval for which the function
  has the same sign at both ends, then rather than subdividing the
  interval Calc attempts to widen it to enclose a root. Use this
  mode if you are not sure if the function has a root in your
  interval.</p>

  <p>If the function is not differentiable, and you give a simple
  number instead of an interval as your initial guess, Calc uses
  this widening process even if you did not type the Hyperbolic
  flag. (If the function <em>is</em> differentiable, Calc uses
  Newton's method which does not require a bounding interval in
  order to work.)</p>

  <p>If Calc leaves the <code>root</code> or <code>wroot</code>
  function in symbolic form on the stack, it will normally display
  an explanation for why no root was found. If you miss this
  explanation, press <kbd>w</kbd> (<code>calc-why</code>) to get it
  back.</p>
