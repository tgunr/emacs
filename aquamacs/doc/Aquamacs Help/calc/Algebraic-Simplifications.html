  <h4 class="subsection">11.3.2 Algebraic Simplifications</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name=
  "index-Algebraic-simplifications-1697" id=
  "index-Algebraic-simplifications-1697"></a>The <kbd>a s</kbd>
  command makes simplifications that may be too slow to do all the
  time, or that may not be desirable all of the time. If you find
  these simplifications are worthwhile, you can type <kbd>m A</kbd>
  to have Calc apply them automatically.</p>

  <p>This section describes all simplifications that are performed
  by the <kbd>a s</kbd> command. Note that these occur in addition
  to the default simplifications; even if the default
  simplifications have been turned off by an <kbd>m O</kbd>
  command, <kbd>a s</kbd> will turn them back on temporarily while
  it simplifies the formula.</p>

  <p>There is a variable, <code>AlgSimpRules</code>, in which you
  can put rewrites to be applied by <kbd>a s</kbd>. Its use is
  analogous to <code>EvalRules</code>, but without the special
  restrictions. Basically, the simplifier does
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a&nbsp;r<!-- /@w -->
   AlgSimpRules</span></samp>&rsquo; with an infinite repeat count
  on the whole expression being simplified, then it traverses the
  expression applying the built-in rules described below. If the
  result is different from the original expression, the process
  repeats with the default simplifications (including
  <code>EvalRules</code>), then <code>AlgSimpRules</code>, then the
  built-in simplifications, and so on.</p>

  <p>Sums are simplified in two ways. Constant terms are commuted
  to the end of the sum, so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a
  + 2 + b</span></samp>&rsquo; changes to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a + b + 2</span></samp>&rsquo;. The only exception is that
  a constant will not be commuted away from the first position of a
  difference, i.e., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 -
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; is not commuted to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x + 2</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Also, terms of sums are combined by the distributive law, as
  in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + 2
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y + 3
  x</span></samp>&rsquo;. This always occurs for adjacent terms,
  but <kbd>a s</kbd> compares all pairs of terms including
  non-adjacent ones.</p>

  <p>Products are sorted into a canonical order using the
  commutative law. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b c
  a</span></samp>&rsquo; is commuted to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a b c</span></samp>&rsquo;. This allows easier comparison
  of products; for example, the default simplifications will not
  change &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x y + y
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x
  y</span></samp>&rsquo;, but <kbd>a s</kbd> will; it first
  rewrites the sum to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x y + x
  y</span></samp>&rsquo;, and then the default simplifications are
  able to recognize a sum of identical terms.</p>

  <p>The canonical ordering used to sort terms of products has the
  property that real-valued numbers, interval forms and infinities
  come first, and are sorted into increasing order. The <kbd>V
  S</kbd> command uses the same ordering when sorting a vector.</p>

  <p>Sorting of terms of products is inhibited when Matrix mode is
  turned on; in this case, Calc will never exchange the order of
  two terms unless it knows at least one of the terms is a
  scalar.</p>

  <p>Products of powers are distributed by comparing all pairs of
  terms, using the same method that the default simplifications use
  for adjacent terms of products.</p>

  <p>Even though sums are not sorted, the commutative law is still
  taken into account when terms of a product are being compared.
  Thus &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x + y) (y +
  x)</span></samp>&rsquo; will be simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x + y)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;. A
  subtle point is that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x - y) (y -
  x)</span></samp>&rsquo; will <em>not</em> be simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-(x - y)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;;
  Calc does not notice that one term can be written as a constant
  times the other, even if that constant is <i>-1</i>.</p>

  <p>A fraction times any expression, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(a:b) x</span></samp>&rsquo;, is changed to a quotient
  involving integers: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x /
  b</span></samp>&rsquo;. This is not done for floating-point
  numbers like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">0.5</span></samp>&rsquo;, however. This is one reason why
  you may find it convenient to turn Fraction mode on while doing
  algebra; see <a href="Fraction-Mode.html#Fraction-Mode">Fraction
  Mode</a>.</p>

  <p>Quotients are simplified by comparing all terms in the
  numerator with all terms in the denominator for possible
  cancellation using the distributive law. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x^2 b / c x^3
  d</span></samp>&rsquo; will cancel &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; from the top and bottom to get
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a b / c x d</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  (The terms in the denominator will then be rearranged to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c d x</span></samp>&rsquo; as
  described above.) If there is any common integer or fractional
  factor in the numerator and denominator, it is cancelled out; for
  example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(4 x + 6) / 8
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; simplifies to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(2 x + 3) / 4 x</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Non-constant common factors are not found even by <kbd>a
  s</kbd>. To cancel the factor &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(a x + a) / a^2</span></samp>&rsquo; you could first use
  <kbd>j M</kbd> on the product &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; to Merge the numerator to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a (1+x)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  which can then be simplified successfully.</p>

  <p>Integer powers of the variable <code>i</code> are simplified
  according to the identity &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i^2 =
  -1</span></samp>&rsquo;. If you store a new value other than the
  complex number &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(0,1)</span></samp>&rsquo; in <code>i</code>, this
  simplification will no longer occur. This is done by <kbd>a
  s</kbd> instead of by default in case someone (unwisely) uses the
  name <code>i</code> for a variable unrelated to complex numbers;
  it would be unfortunate if Calc quietly and automatically changed
  this formula for reasons the user might not have been thinking
  of.</p>

  <p>Square roots of integer or rational arguments are simplified
  in several ways. (Note that these will be left unevaluated only
  in Symbolic mode.) First, square integer or rational factors are
  pulled out so that &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt><span class=
  "samp">(8)</span></samp>&rsquo; is rewritten as
  <!-- @math{2\,@tfn{sqrt}(2)}. -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 sqrt(2)</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  Conceptually speaking this implies factoring the argument into
  primes and moving pairs of primes out of the square root, but for
  reasons of efficiency Calc only looks for primes up to 29.</p>

  <p>Square roots in the denominator of a quotient are moved to the
  numerator: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 /</span>
  <tt>sqrt</tt><span class="samp">(3)</span></samp>&rsquo; changes
  to &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt><span class="samp">(3) /
  3</span></samp>&rsquo;. The same effect occurs for the square
  root of a fraction: &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt><span class=
  "samp">(2:3)</span></samp>&rsquo; changes to
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt><span class="samp">(6) /
  3</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The <code>%</code> (modulo) operator is simplified in several
  ways when the modulus &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; is a positive real number. First,
  if the argument is of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x
  + n</span></samp>&rsquo; for some real number
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, then
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; is itself
  reduced modulo &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo;. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x - 23) %
  10</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x + 7) %
  10</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If the argument is multiplied by a constant, and this constant
  has a common integer divisor with the modulus, then this factor
  is cancelled out. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12
  x % 15</span></samp>&rsquo; is changed to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 (4 x % 5)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  by factoring out 3. Also, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(12 x +
  1) % 15</span></samp>&rsquo; is changed to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 ((4 x + 1:3) %
  5)</span></samp>&rsquo;. While these forms may not seem
  &ldquo;simpler,&rdquo; they allow Calc to discover useful
  information about modulo forms in the presence of
  declarations.</p>

  <p>If the modulus is 1, then Calc can use <code>int</code>
  declarations to evaluate the expression. For example, the idiom
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x % 2</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  often used to check whether a number is odd or even. As described
  above, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2&nbsp;n&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
   and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(2 n + 1) %
  2</span></samp>&rsquo; are simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 (n % 1)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 ((n + 1:2) %
  1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively; Calc can simplify these to
  0 and 1 (respectively) if <code>n</code> has been declared to be
  an integer.</p>

  <p>Trigonometric functions are simplified in several ways.
  Whenever a products of two trigonometric functions can be
  replaced by a single function, the replacement is made; for
  example, &lsquo;<samp><tt>tan</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span>
  <tt>cos</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  simplified to &lsquo;<samp><tt>sin</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Reciprocals of trigonometric
  functions are replaced by their reciprocal function; for example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/</span><tt>sec</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>cos</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. The corresponding
  simplifications for the hyperbolic functions are also
  handled.</p>

  <p>Trigonometric functions of their inverse functions are
  simplified. The expression &lsquo;<samp><tt>sin</tt><span class=
  "samp">(</span><tt>arcsin</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  similarly for <code>cos</code> and <code>tan</code>.
  Trigonometric functions of inverses of different trigonometric
  functions can also be simplified, as in
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>sin</tt><span class=
  "samp">(</span><tt>arccos</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt><span class="samp">(1 -
  x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If the argument to <code>sin</code> is negative-looking, it is
  simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-</span><tt>sin</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and similarly for
  <code>cos</code> and <code>tan</code>. Finally, certain special
  values of the argument are recognized; see <a href=
  "Trigonometric-and-Hyperbolic-Functions.html#Trigonometric-and-Hyperbolic-Functions">
  Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions</a>.</p>

  <p>Hyperbolic functions of their inverses and of negative-looking
  arguments are also handled, as are exponentials of inverse
  hyperbolic functions.</p>

  <p>No simplifications for inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic
  functions are known, except for negative arguments of
  <code>arcsin</code>, <code>arctan</code>, <code>arcsinh</code>,
  and <code>arctanh</code>. Note that
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>arcsin</tt><span class=
  "samp">(</span><tt>sin</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; can <em>not</em> safely change
  to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, since
  this only correct within an integer multiple of
  <!-- @math{2 \pi} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 pi</span></samp>&rsquo;
  radians or 360 degrees. However,
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>arcsinh</tt><span class=
  "samp">(</span><tt>sinh</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; if
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is known
  to be real.</p>

  <p>Several simplifications that apply to logarithms and
  exponentials are that &lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt><span class=
  "samp">(</span><tt>ln</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  <!-- @tfn{e}@math{^{\ln(x)}}, -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e^</span><tt>ln</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  <!-- @math{10^{{\rm log10}(x)}} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">10^</span><tt>log10</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; all reduce to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. Also,
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>ln</tt><span class=
  "samp">(</span><tt>exp</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc., can reduce to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; if
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  provably real. The form &lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x)^y</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt><span class="samp">(x
  y)</span></samp>&rsquo;. If &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is a suitable multiple of
  <!-- @math{\pi i} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pi i</span></samp>&rsquo; (as
  described above for the trigonometric functions), then
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">e^x</span></samp>&rsquo; will be expanded. Finally,
  &lsquo;<samp><tt>ln</tt><span class=
  "samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to a form involving
  <code>pi</code> and <code>i</code> where
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  provably negative, positive imaginary, or negative imaginary.</p>

  <p>The error functions <code>erf</code> and <code>erfc</code> are
  simplified when their arguments are negative-looking or are calls
  to the <code>conj</code> function.</p>

  <p>Equations and inequalities are simplified by cancelling
  factors of products, quotients, or sums on both sides.
  Inequalities change sign if a negative multiplicative factor is
  cancelled. Non-constant multiplicative factors as in
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a b = a c</span></samp>&rsquo;
  are cancelled from equations only if they are provably nonzero
  (generally because they were declared so; see <a href=
  "Declarations.html#Declarations">Declarations</a>). Factors are
  cancelled from inequalities only if they are nonzero and their
  sign is known.</p>

  <p>Simplification also replaces an equation or inequality with 1
  or 0 (&ldquo;true&rdquo; or &ldquo;false&rdquo;) if it can
  through the use of declarations. If &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is declared to be an integer
  greater than 5, then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x &lt;
  3</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x =
  3</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x =
  7.5</span></samp>&rsquo; are all simplified to 0, but
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x &gt; 3</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  simplified to 1. By a similar analysis, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">abs(x) &gt;= 0</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to 1, as
  is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2 &gt;=
  0</span></samp>&rsquo; if &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is known to be real.</p>
