  <h3 class="section">11.4 Polynomials</h3>

  <p>A <dfn>polynomial</dfn> is a sum of terms which are
  coefficients times various powers of a &ldquo;base&rdquo;
  variable. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x^2 + 3
  x - 4</span></samp>&rsquo; is a polynomial in
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. Some
  formulas can be considered polynomials in several different
  variables: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 + 2 x + 3 y + 4 x
  y^2</span></samp>&rsquo; is a polynomial in both
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  Polynomial coefficients are often numbers, but they may in
  general be any formulas not involving the base variable.</p>

  <p><a name="index-a-f-1703" id="index-a-f-1703"></a><a name=

  "index-calc_002dfactor-1704"></a><a name="index-factor-1705" id=
  "index-factor-1705"></a>The <kbd>a f</kbd>
  (<code>calc-factor</code>) [<code>factor</code>] command factors
  a polynomial into a product of terms. For example, the polynomial
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^3 + 2 x^2 +
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; is factored into &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x*(x+1)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;. As another example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a c + b d + b c + a
  d</span></samp>&rsquo; is factored into the product
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a + b) (c +
  d)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Calc currently has three algorithms for factoring. Formulas
  which are linear in several variables, such as the second example
  above, are merged according to the distributive law. Formulas
  which are polynomials in a single variable, with constant integer
  or fractional coefficients, are factored into irreducible linear
  and/or quadratic terms. The first example above factors into
  three linear terms (&lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x+1</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x+1</span></samp>&rsquo; again). Finally, formulas which
  do not fit the above criteria are handled by the algebraic
  rewrite mechanism.</p>

  <p>Calc's polynomial factorization algorithm works by using the
  general root-finding command (<kbd>a&nbsp;P</kbd><!-- /@w -->) to
  solve for the roots of the polynomial. It then looks for roots
  which are rational numbers or complex-conjugate pairs, and
  converts these into linear and quadratic terms, respectively.
  Because it uses floating-point arithmetic, it may be unable to
  find terms that involve large integers (whose number of digits
  approaches the current precision). Also, irreducible factors of
  degree higher than quadratic are not found, and polynomials in
  more than one variable are not treated. (A more robust
  factorization algorithm may be included in a future version of
  Calc.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-FactorRules-1706" id=
  "index-FactorRules-1706"></a><a name="index-thecoefs-1707" id=
  "index-thecoefs-1707"></a><a name="index-thefactors-1708" id=
  "index-thefactors-1708"></a>The rewrite-based factorization
  method uses rules stored in the variable
  <code>FactorRules</code>. See <a href=
  "Rewrite-Rules.html#Rewrite-Rules">Rewrite Rules</a>, for a
  discussion of the operation of rewrite rules. The default
  <code>FactorRules</code> are able to factor quadratic forms
  symbolically into two linear terms, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(a x + b) (c x + d)</span></samp>&rsquo;. You can edit
  these rules to include other cases if you wish. To use the rules,
  Calc builds the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">thecoefs(x, [a, b, c, ...])</span></samp>&rsquo; where
  <code>x</code> is the polynomial base variable and
  <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, etc., are polynomial coefficients
  (which may be numbers or formulas). The constant term is written
  first, i.e., in the <code>a</code> position. When the rules
  complete, they should have changed the formula into the form
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thefactors(x, [f1, f2, f3,
  ...])</span></samp>&rsquo; where each <code>fi</code> should be a
  factored term, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x -
  ai</span></samp>&rsquo;. Calc then multiplies these terms
  together to get the complete factored form of the polynomial. If
  the rules do not change the <code>thecoefs</code> call to a
  <code>thefactors</code> call, <kbd>a f</kbd> leaves the
  polynomial alone on the assumption that it is unfactorable. (Note
  that the function names <code>thecoefs</code> and
  <code>thefactors</code> are used only as placeholders; there are
  no actual Calc functions by those names.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-H-a-f-1709" id="index-H-a-f-1709"></a><a name=
  "index-factors-1710" id="index-factors-1710"></a>The <kbd>H a
  f</kbd> [<code>factors</code>] command also factors a polynomial,
  but it returns a list of factors instead of an expression which
  is the product of the factors. Each factor is represented by a
  sub-vector of the factor, and the power with which it appears.
  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^5 + x^4 - 33 x^3 +
  63 x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; factors to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(x + 7) x^2 (x - 3)^2</span></samp>&rsquo; in <kbd>a
  f</kbd>, or to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ [x, 2], [x+7,
  1], [x-3, 2] ]</span></samp>&rsquo; in <kbd>H a f</kbd>. If there
  is an overall numeric factor, it always comes first in the list.
  The functions <code>factor</code> and <code>factors</code> allow
  a second argument when written in algebraic form;
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">factor(x,v)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  factors &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;
  with respect to the specific variable &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">v</span></samp>&rsquo;. The default is to factor with
  respect to all the variables that appear in
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><a name="index-a-c-1711" id="index-a-c-1711"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dcollect-1712" id=
  "index-calc_002dcollect-1712"></a><a name="index-collect-1713"
  id="index-collect-1713"></a>The <kbd>a c</kbd>
  (<code>calc-collect</code>) [<code>collect</code>] command
  rearranges a formula as a polynomial in a given variable, ordered
  in decreasing powers of that variable. For example, given
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 + 2 x + 3 y + 4 x
  y^2</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack, <kbd>a c x</kbd> would
  produce &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(2 + 4 y^2) x + (1 + 3
  y)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and <kbd>a c y</kbd> would produce
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(4 x) y^2 + 3 y + (1 + 2
  x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. The polynomial will be expanded out
  using the distributive law as necessary: Collecting
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; in
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x - 1)^3</span></samp>&rsquo;
  produces &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^3 - 3 x^2 + 3 x -
  1</span></samp>&rsquo;. Terms not involving
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; will not
  be expanded.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;variable&rdquo; you specify at the prompt can
  actually be any expression: <kbd>a c ln(x+1)</kbd> will collect
  together all terms multiplied by &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">ln(x+1)</span></samp>&rsquo; or integer powers thereof. If
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; also
  appears in the formula in a context other than
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(x+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  <kbd>a c</kbd> will treat those occurrences as unrelated to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(x+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  i.e., as constants.</p>

  <p><a name="index-a-x-1714" id="index-a-x-1714"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dexpand-1715" id=
  "index-calc_002dexpand-1715"></a><a name="index-expand-1716" id=
  "index-expand-1716"></a>The <kbd>a x</kbd>
  (<code>calc-expand</code>) [<code>expand</code>] command expands
  an expression by applying the distributive law everywhere. It
  applies to products, quotients, and powers involving sums. By
  default, it fully distributes all parts of the expression. With a
  numeric prefix argument, the distributive law is applied only the
  specified number of times, then the partially expanded expression
  is left on the stack.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>a x</kbd> and <kbd>j D</kbd> commands are somewhat
  redundant. Use <kbd>a x</kbd> if you want to expand all products
  of sums in your formula. Use <kbd>j D</kbd> if you want to expand
  a particular specified term of the formula. There is an exactly
  analogous correspondence between <kbd>a f</kbd> and <kbd>j
  M</kbd>. (The <kbd>j D</kbd> and <kbd>j M</kbd> commands also
  know many other kinds of expansions, such as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(a + b) = exp(a)
  exp(b)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which <kbd>a x</kbd> and <kbd>a
  f</kbd> do not do.)</p>

  <p>Calc's automatic simplifications will sometimes reverse a
  partial expansion. For example, the first step in expanding
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x+1)^3</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  to write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x+1)
  (x+1)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;. If <kbd>a x</kbd> stops there and
  tries to put this formula onto the stack, though, Calc will
  automatically simplify it back to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(x+1)^3</span></samp>&rsquo; form. The solution is to turn
  simplification off first (see <a href=
  "Simplification-Modes.html#Simplification-Modes">Simplification
  Modes</a>), or to run <kbd>a x</kbd> without a numeric prefix
  argument so that it expands all the way in one step.</p>

  "index-calc_002dapart-1718"></a><a name="index-apart-1719" id=
  "index-apart-1719"></a>The <kbd>a a</kbd>
  (<code>calc-apart</code>) [<code>apart</code>] command expands a
  rational function by partial fractions. A rational function is
  the quotient of two polynomials; <code>apart</code> pulls this
  apart into a sum of rational functions with simple denominators.
  In algebraic notation, the <code>apart</code> function allows a
  second argument that specifies which variable to use as the
  &ldquo;base&rdquo;; by default, Calc chooses the base variable
  automatically.</p>

  "index-calc_002dnormalize_002drat-1721"></a><a name=
  "index-nrat-1722" id="index-nrat-1722"></a>The <kbd>a n</kbd>
  (<code>calc-normalize-rat</code>) [<code>nrat</code>] command
  attempts to arrange a formula into a quotient of two polynomials.
  For example, given &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 + (a + b/c)
  / d</span></samp>&rsquo;, the result would be
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(b + a c + c d) / c
  d</span></samp>&rsquo;. The quotient is reduced, so that <kbd>a
  n</kbd> will simplify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x^2 + 2x +
  1) / (x^2 - 1)</span></samp>&rsquo; by dividing out the common
  factor &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x +
  1</span></samp>&rsquo;, yielding &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(x + 1) / (x - 1)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><a name="index-a-_005c-1723" id=
  "index-a-_005c-1723"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dpoly_002ddiv-1724" id=
  "index-calc_002dpoly_002ddiv-1724"></a><a name="index-pdiv-1725"
  id="index-pdiv-1725"></a>The <kbd>a \</kbd>
  (<code>calc-poly-div</code>) [<code>pdiv</code>] command divides
  two polynomials &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">u</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">v</span></samp>&rsquo;, yielding a new polynomial
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo;. If
  several variables occur in the inputs, the inputs are considered
  multivariate polynomials. (Calc divides by the variable with the
  largest power in &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">u</span></samp>&rsquo; first, or, in the case of equal
  powers, chooses the variables in alphabetical order.) For
  example, dividing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2 + 3 x +
  2</span></samp>&rsquo; by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x +
  2</span></samp>&rsquo; yields &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x +
  1</span></samp>&rsquo;. The remainder from the division, if any,
  is reported at the bottom of the screen and is also placed in the
  Trail along with the quotient.</p>

  <p>Using <code>pdiv</code> in algebraic notation, you can specify
  the particular variable to be used as the base:
  <code>pdiv(</code><var>a</var><code>,</code><var>b</var><code>,</code><var>x</var><code>)</code>.
  If <code>pdiv</code> is given only two arguments (as is always
  the case with the <kbd>a \</kbd> command), then it does a
  multivariate division as outlined above.</p>

  id="index-prem-1728"></a>The <kbd>a %</kbd>
  (<code>calc-poly-rem</code>) [<code>prem</code>] command divides
  two polynomials and keeps the remainder &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo;. The quotient
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  discarded. For any formulas &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, the results of <kbd>a \</kbd> and
  <kbd>a %</kbd> satisfy &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a = q b +
  r</span></samp>&rsquo;. (This is analogous to plain <kbd>\</kbd>
  and <kbd>%</kbd>, which compute the integer quotient and
  remainder from dividing two numbers.)</p>

  /</kbd> (<code>calc-poly-div-rem</code>) [<code>pdivrem</code>]
  command divides two polynomials and reports both the quotient and
  the remainder as a vector &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[q,
  r]</span></samp>&rsquo;. The <kbd>H a /</kbd>
  [<code>pdivide</code>] command divides two polynomials and
  constructs the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q +
  r/b</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack. (Naturally if the
  remainder is zero, this will immediately simplify to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  "index-calc_002dpoly_002dgcd-1735"></a><a name="index-pgcd-1736"
  id="index-pgcd-1736"></a>The <kbd>a g</kbd>
  (<code>calc-poly-gcd</code>) [<code>pgcd</code>] command computes
  the greatest common divisor of two polynomials. (The GCD actually
  is unique only to within a constant multiplier; Calc attempts to
  choose a GCD which will be unsurprising.) For example, the <kbd>a
  n</kbd> command uses <kbd>a g</kbd> to take the GCD of the
  numerator and denominator of a quotient, then divides each by the
  result using <kbd>a \</kbd>. (The definition of GCD ensures that
  this division can take place without leaving a remainder.)</p>

  <p>While the polynomials used in operations like <kbd>a /</kbd>
  and <kbd>a g</kbd> often have integer coefficients, this is not
  required. Calc can also deal with polynomials over the rationals
  or floating-point reals. Polynomials with modulo-form
  coefficients are also useful in many applications; if you enter
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x^2 + 3 x - 1) mod
  5</span></samp>&rsquo;, Calc automatically transforms this into a
  polynomial over the field of integers mod 5:
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(1 mod 5) x^2 + (3 mod 5) x + (4
  mod 5)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
