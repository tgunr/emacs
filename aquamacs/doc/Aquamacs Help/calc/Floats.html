  <h3 class="section">5.3 Floats</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><a name=
  "index-Floating_002dpoint-numbers-239" id=
  "index-Floating_002dpoint-numbers-239"></a>A floating-point
  number or <dfn>float</dfn> is a number stored in scientific
  notation. The number of significant digits in the fractional part
  is governed by the current floating precision (see <a href=
  "Precision.html#Precision">Precision</a>). The range of
  acceptable values is from <!-- @math{10^{-3999999}} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10^-3999999</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (inclusive) to <!-- @math{10^{4000000}} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10^4000000</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (exclusive), plus the corresponding negative values and zero.</p>

  <p>Calculations that would exceed the allowable range of values
  (such as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">exp(exp(20))</span></samp>&rsquo;) are left in symbolic
  form by Calc. The messages &ldquo;floating-point overflow&rdquo;
  or &ldquo;floating-point underflow&rdquo; indicate that during
  the calculation a number would have been produced that was too
  large or too close to zero, respectively, to be represented by
  Calc. This does not necessarily mean the final result would have
  overflowed, just that an overflow occurred while computing the
  result. (In fact, it could report an underflow even though the
  final result would have overflowed!)</p>

  <p>If a rational number and a float are mixed in a calculation,
  the result will in general be expressed as a float. Commands that
  require an integer value (such as <kbd>k g</kbd>
  [<code>gcd</code>]) will also accept integer-valued floats, i.e.,
  floating-point numbers with nothing after the decimal point.</p>

  <p>Floats are identified by the presence of a decimal point
  and/or an exponent. In general a float consists of an optional
  sign, digits including an optional decimal point, and an optional
  exponent consisting of an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo;, an optional sign, and up to seven
  exponent digits. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">23.5e-2</span></samp>&rsquo; is 23.5 times ten to the
  minus-second power, or 0.235.</p>

  <p>Floating-point numbers are normally displayed in decimal
  notation with all significant figures shown. Exceedingly large or
  small numbers are displayed in scientific notation. Various other
  display options are available. See <a href=
  "Float-Formats.html#Float-Formats">Float Formats</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Accuracy-of-calculations-240" id=
  "index-Accuracy-of-calculations-240"></a>Floating-point numbers
  are stored in decimal, not binary. The result of each operation
  is rounded to the nearest value representable in the number of
  significant digits specified by the current precision, rounding
  away from zero in the case of a tie. Thus (in the default display
  mode) what you see is exactly what you get. Some operations such
  as square roots and transcendental functions are performed with
  several digits of extra precision and then rounded down, in an
  effort to make the final result accurate to the full requested
  precision. However, accuracy is not rigorously guaranteed. If you
  suspect the validity of a result, try doing the same calculation
  in a higher precision. The Calculator's arithmetic is not
  intended to be IEEE-conformant in any way.</p>

  <p>While floats are always <em>stored</em> in decimal, they can
  be entered and displayed in any radix just like integers and
  fractions. Since a float that is entered in a radix other that 10
  will be converted to decimal, the number that Calc stores may not
  be exactly the number that was entered, it will be the closest
  decimal approximation given the current precison. The notation
  &lsquo;<samp><var>radix</var><span class=
  "samp">#</span><var>ddd</var><span class=
  "samp">.</span><var>ddd</var></samp>&rsquo; is a floating-point
  number whose digits are in the specified radix. Note that the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; is more
  aptly referred to as a &ldquo;radix point&rdquo; than as a
  decimal point in this case. The number &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">8#123.4567</span></samp>&rsquo; is defined as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8#1234567 *
  8^-4</span></samp>&rsquo;. If the radix is 14 or less, you can
  use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo;
  notation to write a non-decimal number in scientific notation.
  The exponent is written in decimal, and is considered to be a
  power of the radix: &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">8#1234567e-4</span></samp>&rsquo;. If the radix is 15 or
  above, the letter &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo; is a digit, so scientific notation
  must be written out, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">16#123.4567*16^2</span></samp>&rsquo;. The first two
  exercises of the Modes Tutorial explore some of the properties of
  non-decimal floats.</p>
