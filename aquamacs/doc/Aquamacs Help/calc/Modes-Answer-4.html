  <h4 class="subsection">3.7.11 Modes Tutorial Exercise 4</h4>

  <p class="noindent">Many calculations involve real-world
  quantities, like the width and height of a piece of wood or the
  volume of a jar. Such quantities can't be measured exactly
  anyway, and if the data that is input to a calculation is
  inexact, doing exact arithmetic on it is a waste of time.</p>

  <p>Fractions become unwieldy after too many calculations have
  been done with them. For example, the sum of the reciprocals of
  the integers from 1 to 10 is 7381:2520. The sum from 1 to 30 is
  9304682830147:2329089562800. After a point it will take a long
  time to add even one more term to this sum, but a floating-point
  calculation of the sum will not have this problem.</p>

  <p>Also, rational numbers cannot express the results of all
  calculations. There is no fractional form for the square root of
  two, so if you type <kbd>2&nbsp;Q</kbd><!-- /@w -->, Calc has no
  choice but to give you a floating-point answer.</p>
