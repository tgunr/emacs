  <h3 class="section">3.4 Types Tutorial</h3>

  <p class="noindent">Calc understands a variety of data types as
  well as simple numbers. In this section, we'll experiment with
  each of these types in turn.</p>

  <p>The numbers we've been using so far have mainly been either
  <dfn>integers</dfn> or <dfn>floats</dfn>. We saw that floats are
  usually a good approximation to the mathematical concept of real
  numbers, but they are only approximations and are susceptible to
  roundoff error. Calc also supports <dfn>fractions</dfn>, which
  can exactly represent any rational number.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  3628800    2:  3628800    1:  518400:7   1:  518414:7   1:  7:518414
         .          1:  49             .              .              .
                        .

         10 !           49 &lt;RET&gt;         :              2 +            &amp;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The <kbd>:</kbd> command divides two integers
  to get a fraction; <kbd>/</kbd> would normally divide integers to
  get a floating-point result. Notice we had to type &lt;RET&gt;
  between the <kbd>49</kbd> and the <kbd>:</kbd> since the
  <kbd>:</kbd> would otherwise be interpreted as part of a fraction
  beginning with 49.</p>

  <p>You can convert between floating-point and fractional format
  using <kbd>c f</kbd> and <kbd>c F</kbd>:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  1.35027217629e-5    1:  7:518414
         .                       .

         c f                     c F
</pre>

  <p>The <kbd>c F</kbd> command replaces a floating-point number
  with the &ldquo;simplest&rdquo; fraction whose floating-point
  representation is the same, to within the current precision.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  3.14159265359   1:  1146408:364913   1:  3.1416   1:  355:113
         .                   .                    .            .

         P                   c F      &lt;DEL&gt;       p 5 &lt;RET&gt; P      c F
</pre>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> A calculation has
  produced the result 1.26508260337. You suspect it is the square
  root of the product of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">pi</span></samp>&rsquo; and some rational number. Is it?
  (Be sure to allow for roundoff error!) See <a href=
  "Types-Answer-1.html#Types-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p><dfn>Complex numbers</dfn> can be stored in both rectangular
  and polar form.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  -9     1:  (0, 3)    1:  (3; 90.)   1:  (6; 90.)   1:  (2.4495; 45.)
         .          .             .              .              .

         9 n        Q             c p            2 *            Q
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The square root of <i>-9</i> is by default
  rendered in rectangular form (&lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">0&nbsp;+&nbsp;3i</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->), but we
  can convert it to polar form (3 with a phase angle of 90
  degrees). All the usual arithmetic and scientific operations are
  defined on both types of complex numbers.</p>

  <p>Another generalized kind of number is <dfn>infinity</dfn>.
  Infinity isn't really a number, but it can sometimes be treated
  like one. Calc uses the symbol <code>inf</code> to represent
  positive infinity, i.e., a value greater than any real number.
  Naturally, you can also write &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo; for minus infinity, a value less
  than any real number. The word <code>inf</code> can only be input
  using algebraic entry.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  inf        2:  -inf       2:  -inf       2:  -inf       1:  nan
     1:  -17        1:  -inf       1:  -inf       1:  inf            .
         .              .              .              .

     ' inf &lt;RET&gt; 17 n     *  &lt;RET&gt;         72 +           A              +
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Since infinity is infinitely large,
  multiplying it by any finite number (like <i>-17</i>) has no
  effect, except that since <i>-17</i> is negative, it changes a
  plus infinity to a minus infinity. (&ldquo;A huge positive
  number, multiplied by <i>-17</i>, yields a huge negative
  number.&rdquo;) Adding any finite number to infinity also leaves
  it unchanged. Taking an absolute value gives us plus infinity
  again. Finally, we add this plus infinity to the minus infinity
  we had earlier. If you work it out, you might expect the answer
  to be <i>-72</i> for this. But the 72 has been completely lost
  next to the infinities; by the time we compute
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">inf&nbsp;-&nbsp;inf</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
   the finite difference between them, if any, is undetectable. So
  we say the result is <dfn>indeterminate</dfn>, which Calc writes
  with the symbol <code>nan</code> (for Not A Number).</p>

  <p>Dividing by zero is normally treated as an error, but you can
  get Calc to write an answer in terms of infinity by pressing
  <kbd>m i</kbd> to turn on Infinite mode.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     3:  nan        2:  nan        2:  nan        2:  nan        1:  nan
     2:  1          1:  1 / 0      1:  uinf       1:  uinf           .
     1:  0              .              .              .
         .

       1 &lt;RET&gt; 0          /       m i    U /            17 n *         +
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Dividing by zero normally is left
  unevaluated, but after <kbd>m i</kbd> it instead gives an
  infinite result. The answer is actually <code>uinf</code>,
  &ldquo;undirected infinity.&rdquo; If you look at a graph of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / x</span></samp>&rsquo; around
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->, you'll
  see that it goes toward plus infinity as you approach zero from
  above, but toward minus infinity as you approach from below.
  Since we said only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 /
  0</span></samp>&rsquo;, Calc knows that the answer is infinite
  but not in which direction. That's what <code>uinf</code> means.
  Notice that multiplying <code>uinf</code> by a negative number
  still leaves plain <code>uinf</code>; there's no point in saying
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-uinf</span></samp>&rsquo;
  because the sign of <code>uinf</code> is unknown anyway. Finally,
  we add <code>uinf</code> to our <code>nan</code>, yielding
  <code>nan</code> again. It's easy to see that, because
  <code>nan</code> means &ldquo;totally unknown&rdquo; while
  <code>uinf</code> means &ldquo;unknown sign but known to be
  infinite,&rdquo; the more mysterious <code>nan</code> wins out
  when it is combined with <code>uinf</code>, or, for that matter,
  with anything else.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Predict what Calc will
  answer for each of these formulas: &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">inf / inf</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">exp(inf)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">exp(-inf)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(-inf)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(uinf)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">abs(uinf)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">ln(0)</span></samp>&rsquo;. See <a href=
  "Types-Answer-2.html#Types-Answer-2">2</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> We saw that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf - inf =
  nan</span></samp>&rsquo;, which stands for an unknown value. Can
  <code>nan</code> stand for a complex number? Can it stand for
  infinity? See <a href="Types-Answer-3.html#Types-Answer-3">3</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p><dfn>HMS forms</dfn> represent a value in terms of hours,
  minutes, and seconds.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2@ 30' 0"     1:  3@ 30' 0"     2:  3@ 30' 0"     1:  2.
         .                 .             1:  1@ 45' 0."        .
                                             .

       2@ 30' &lt;RET&gt;          1 +               &lt;RET&gt; 2 /           /
</pre>

  <p>HMS forms can also be used to hold angles in degrees, minutes,
  and seconds.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  0.5        1:  26.56505   1:  26@ 33' 54.18"    1:  0.44721
         .              .              .                     .

         0.5            I T            c h                   S
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">First we convert the inverse tangent of 0.5
  to degrees-minutes-seconds form, then we take the sine of that
  angle. Note that the trigonometric functions will accept HMS
  forms directly as input.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Beatles-57" id="index-Beatles-57"></a>(&bull;)
  <strong>Exercise 4.</strong> The Beatles' <em>Abbey Road</em> is
  47 minutes and 26 seconds long, and contains 17 songs. What is
  the average length of a song on <em>Abbey Road</em>? If the
  Extended Disco Version of <em>Abbey Road</em> added 20 seconds to
  the length of each song, how long would the album be? See
  <a href="Types-Answer-4.html#Types-Answer-4">4</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>A <dfn>date form</dfn> represents a date, or a date and time.
  Dates must be entered using algebraic entry. Date forms are
  surrounded by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;
  &gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; symbols; most standard formats for
  dates are recognized.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  &lt;Sun Jan 13, 1991&gt;                    1:  2.25
     1:  &lt;6:00pm Thu Jan 10, 1991&gt;                 .
         .

     ' &lt;13 Jan 1991&gt;, &lt;1/10/91, 6pm&gt; &lt;RET&gt;           -
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">In this example, we enter two dates, then
  subtract to find the number of days between them. It is also
  possible to add an HMS form or a number (of days) to a date form
  to get another date form.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  &lt;4:45:59pm Mon Jan 14, 1991&gt;     1:  &lt;2:50:59am Thu Jan 17, 1991&gt;
         .                                    .

         t N                                  2 + 10@ 5' +
</pre><!-- [fix-ref Date Arithmetic] -->

  <p class="noindent">The <kbd>t N</kbd> (&ldquo;now&rdquo;)
  command pushes the current date and time on the stack; then we
  add two days, ten hours and five minutes to the date and time.
  Other date-and-time related commands include <kbd>t J</kbd>,
  which does Julian day conversions, <kbd>t W</kbd>, which finds
  the beginning of the week in which a date form lies, and <kbd>t
  I</kbd>, which increments a date by one or several months. See
  <a href="Date-Arithmetic.html#Date-Arithmetic">Date
  Arithmetic</a>, for more.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 5.</strong> How many days until the

  there be between now and the year 10001 A.D.? See <a href=

  "index-Angle-and-slope-of-a-line-59"></a>An <dfn>error form</dfn>
  represents a mean value with an attached standard deviation, or
  error estimate. Suppose our measurements indicate that a certain
  telephone pole is about 30 meters away, with an estimated error
  of 1 meter, and 8 meters tall, with an estimated error of 0.2
  meters. What is the slope of a line from here to the top of the
  pole, and what is the equivalent angle in degrees?</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  8 +/- 0.2    2:  8 +/- 0.2   1:  0.266 +/- 0.011   1:  14.93 +/- 0.594
         .            1:  30 +/- 1        .                     .
                          .

         8 p .2 &lt;RET&gt;       30 p 1          /                     I T
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">This means that the angle is about 15
  degrees, and, assuming our original error estimates were valid
  standard deviations, there is about a 60% chance that the result
  is correct within 0.59 degrees.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Torus_002c-volume-of-60" id=
  "index-Torus_002c-volume-of-60"></a>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise
  7.</strong> The volume of a torus (a donut shape) is
  <!-- @math{2 \pi^2 R r^2} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2&nbsp;pi^2&nbsp;R&nbsp;r^2</span></samp>&rsquo;
  <!-- /@w -->
   where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  the radius of the circle that defines the center of the tube and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; is the
  radius of the tube itself. Suppose &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo; is 20 cm and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; is 4 cm,
  each known to within 5 percent. What is the volume and the
  relative uncertainty of the volume? See <a href=
  "Types-Answer-7.html#Types-Answer-7">7</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>An <dfn>interval form</dfn> represents a range of values.
  While an error form is best for making statistical estimates,
  intervals give you exact bounds on an answer. Suppose we
  additionally know that our telephone pole is definitely between
  28 and 31 meters away, and that it is between 7.7 and 8.1 meters
  tall.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [7.7 .. 8.1]  2:  [7.7 .. 8.1]  1:  [0.24 .. 0.28]  1:  [13.9 .. 16.1]
         .             1:  [28 .. 31]        .                   .
                           .

       [ 7.7 .. 8.1 ]    [ 28 .. 31 ]        /                   I T
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">If our bounds were correct, then the angle to
  the top of the pole is sure to lie in the range shown.</p>

  <p>The square brackets around these intervals indicate that the
  endpoints themselves are allowable values. In other words, the
  distance to the telephone pole is between 28 and 31,
  <em>inclusive</em>. You can also make an interval that is
  exclusive of its endpoints by writing parentheses instead of
  square brackets. You can even make an interval which is inclusive
  (&ldquo;closed&rdquo;) on one end and exclusive
  (&ldquo;open&rdquo;) on the other.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [1 .. 10)    1:  (0.1 .. 1]   2:  (0.1 .. 1]   1:  (0.2 .. 3)
         .                .            1:  [2 .. 3)         .
                                           .

       [ 1 .. 10 )        &amp;              [ 2 .. 3 )         *
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The Calculator automatically keeps track of
  which end values should be open and which should be closed. You
  can also make infinite or semi-infinite intervals by using
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf</span></samp>&rsquo; for one
  or both endpoints.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 8.</strong> What answer would you
  expect from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1&nbsp;/<!-- /@w -->
   (0&nbsp;..&nbsp;10)<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;? What about
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1&nbsp;/<!-- /@w -->
   (-10&nbsp;..&nbsp;0)<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;? What
  about &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1&nbsp;/<!-- /@w -->
   [0&nbsp;..&nbsp;10]<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo; (where the
  interval actually includes zero)? What about
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1&nbsp;/<!-- /@w -->
   (-10&nbsp;..&nbsp;10)<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;? See
  <a href="Types-Answer-8.html#Types-Answer-8">8</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 9.</strong> Two easy ways of
  squaring a number are <kbd>&lt;RET&gt; *</kbd> and
  <kbd>2&nbsp;^</kbd><!-- /@w -->. Normally these produce the same
  answer. Would you expect this still to hold true for interval
  forms? If not, which of these will result in a larger interval?
  See <a href="Types-Answer-9.html#Types-Answer-9">9</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>A <dfn>modulo form</dfn> is used for performing arithmetic
  modulo <var>m</var>. For example, arithmetic involving time is
  generally done modulo 12 or 24 hours.</p>

  <p class="noindent">In this last step, Calc has divided by 5
  modulo 24; i.e., it has found a new number which, when multiplied
  by 5 modulo 24, produces the original number, 21. If <var>m</var>
  is prime and the divisor is not a multiple of <var>m</var>, it is
  always possible to find such a number. For non-prime <var>m</var>
  like 24, it is only sometimes possible.</p>

  <strong>Exercise 10.</strong> A theorem of Pierre de Fermat says
  that <!-- @w{@math{x^{n-1} \bmod n = 1}} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^(n-1) mod n =
  1</span></samp>&rsquo; if &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; is a prime number and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is an
  integer less than &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;. If &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; is <em>not</em> a prime number,
  this will <em>not</em> be true for most values of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. Thus we
  can test informally if a number is prime by trying this formula
  for several values of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. Use this test to tell whether the
  following numbers are prime: 811749613, 15485863. See <a href=

  <p>It is possible to use HMS forms as parts of error forms,

  <p>Another kind of data the Calculator can manipulate is numbers
  with <dfn>units</dfn>. This isn't strictly a new data type; it's
  simply an application of algebraic expressions, where we use
  variables with suggestive names like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">cm</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">in</span></samp>&rsquo; to represent units like
  centimeters and inches.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2 in        1:  5.08 cm      1:  0.027778 fath   1:  0.0508 m

</pre>

  <p class="noindent">We enter the quantity &ldquo;2 inches&rdquo;
  (actually an algebraic expression which means two times the
  variable &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">in</span></samp>&rsquo;), then we convert it first to
  centimeters, then to fathoms, then finally to &ldquo;base&rdquo;
  units, which in this case means meters.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  9 acre     1:  3 sqrt(acre)   1:  190.84 m   1:  190.84 m + 30 cm

  <pre class="smallexample">

         u s              2 ^                   u c cgs
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Since units expressions are really just
  formulas, taking the square root of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">acre</span></samp>&rsquo; is undefined. After all,
  <code>acre</code> might be an algebraic variable that you will
  someday assign a value. We use the &ldquo;units-simplify&rdquo;
  command to simplify the expression with variables being
  interpreted as unit names.</p>

  <p>In the final step, we have converted not to a particular unit,
  but to a units system. The &ldquo;cgs&rdquo; system uses
  centimeters instead of meters as its standard unit of length.</p>

  <p>There is a wide variety of units defined in the
  Calculator.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  55 mph     1:  88.5139 kph   1:   88.5139 km / hr   1:  8.201407e-8 c
         .              .                  .                     .

      ' 55 mph &lt;RET&gt;      u c kph &lt;RET&gt;        u c km/hr &lt;RET&gt;         u c c &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">We express a speed first in miles per hour,
  then in kilometers per hour, then again using a slightly more
  explicit notation, then finally in terms of fractions of the
  speed of light.</p>

  <p>Temperature conversions are a bit more tricky. There are two
  ways to interpret &ldquo;20 degrees Fahrenheit&rdquo;&mdash;it
  could mean an actual temperature, or it could mean a change in
  temperature. For normal units there is no difference, but
  temperature units have an offset as well as a scale factor and so
  there must be two explicit commands for them.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  20 degF       1:  11.1111 degC     1:  -20:3 degC    1:  -6.666 degC
         .                 .                    .                 .

       ' 20 degF &lt;RET&gt;       u c degC &lt;RET&gt;         U u t degC &lt;RET&gt;    c f
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">First we convert a change of 20 degrees
  Fahrenheit into an equivalent change in degrees Celsius (or
  Centigrade). Then, we convert the absolute temperature 20 degrees
  Fahrenheit into Celsius. Since this comes out as an exact
  fraction, we then convert to floating-point for easier comparison
  with the other result.</p>

  <p>For simple unit conversions, you can put a plain number on the
  stack. Then <kbd>u c</kbd> and <kbd>u t</kbd> will prompt for
  both old and new units. When you use this method, you're
  responsible for remembering which numbers are in which units:</p>
