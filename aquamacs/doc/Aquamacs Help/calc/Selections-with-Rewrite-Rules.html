  <h4 class="subsection">11.11.9 Selections with Rewrite Rules</h4>

  <p class="noindent">If a sub-formula of the current formula is
  selected (as by <kbd>j s</kbd>; see <a href=
  "Selecting-Subformulas.html#Selecting-Subformulas">Selecting
  Subformulas</a>), the <kbd>a r</kbd> (<code>calc-rewrite</code>)
  command applies only to that sub-formula. Together with a
  negative prefix argument, you can use this fact to apply a
  rewrite to one specific part of a formula without affecting any
  other parts.</p>

  <p><a name="index-j-r-1942" id="index-j-r-1942"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002drewrite_002dselection-1943" id=
  "index-calc_002drewrite_002dselection-1943"></a>The <kbd>j
  r</kbd> (<code>calc-rewrite-selection</code>) command allows more
  sophisticated operations on selections. This command prompts for
  the rules in the same way as <kbd>a r</kbd>, but it then applies
  those rules to the whole formula in question even though a
  sub-formula of it has been selected. However, the selected
  sub-formula will first have been surrounded by a
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select( )</span></samp>&rsquo;
  function call. (Calc's evaluator does not understand the function
  name <code>select</code>; this is only a tag used by the <kbd>j
  r</kbd> command.)</p>

  <p>For example, suppose the formula on the stack is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 (a + b)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;
  and the sub-formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a +
  b</span></samp>&rsquo; is selected. This formula will be
  rewritten to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 select(a +
  b)^2</span></samp>&rsquo; and then the rewrite rules will be
  applied in the usual way. The rewrite rules can include
  references to <code>select</code> to tell where in the pattern
  the selected sub-formula should appear.</p>

  <p>If there is still exactly one &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">select( )</span></samp>&rsquo; function call in the
  formula after rewriting is done, it indicates which part of the
  formula should be selected afterwards. Otherwise, the formula
  will be unselected.</p>

  <p>You can make <kbd>j r</kbd> act much like <kbd>a r</kbd> by
  enclosing both parts of the rewrite rule with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select()</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  However, <kbd>j r</kbd> allows you to use the current selection
  in more flexible ways. Suppose you wished to make a rule which
  removed the exponent from the selected term; the rule
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select(a)^x :=
  select(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; would work. In the above example,
  it would rewrite &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 select(a +
  b)^2</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2
  select(a + b)</span></samp>&rsquo;. This would then be returned
  to the stack as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 (a +
  b)</span></samp>&rsquo; with the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a + b</span></samp>&rsquo; selected.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>j r</kbd> command uses one iteration by default,
  unlike <kbd>a r</kbd> which defaults to 100 iterations. A numeric
  prefix argument affects <kbd>j r</kbd> in the same way as <kbd>a
  r</kbd>. See <a href=
  "Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules.html#Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules">
  Nested Formulas with Rewrite Rules</a>.</p>

  <p>As with other selection commands, <kbd>j r</kbd> operates on
  the stack entry that contains the cursor. (If the cursor is on
  the top-of-stack &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; marker, it works as if the cursor
  were on the formula at stack level 1.)</p>

  <p>If you don't specify a set of rules, the rules are taken from
  the top of the stack, just as with <kbd>a r</kbd>. In this case,
  the cursor must indicate stack entry 2 or above as the formula to
  be rewritten (otherwise the same formula would be used as both
  the target and the rewrite rules).</p>

  <p>If the indicated formula has no selection, the cursor position
  within the formula temporarily selects a sub-formula for the
  purposes of this command. If the cursor is not on any sub-formula
  (e.g., it is in the line-number area to the left of the formula),
  the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select(
  )</span></samp>&rsquo; markers are ignored by the rewrite
  mechanism and the rules are allowed to apply anywhere in the
  formula.</p>

  <p>As a special feature, the normal <kbd>a r</kbd> command also
  ignores &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select(
  )</span></samp>&rsquo; calls in rewrite rules. For example, if
  you used the above rule &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">select(a)^x := select(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; with <kbd>a
  r</kbd>, it would apply the rule as if it were
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a^x := a</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  Thus, you can write general purpose rules with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select( )</span></samp>&rsquo;
  hints inside them so that they will &ldquo;do the right
  thing&rdquo; in both <kbd>a r</kbd> and <kbd>j r</kbd>, both with
  and without selections.</p>
