  <h4 class="subsection">11.1.4 Operating on Selections</h4>

  <p class="noindent">Once a selection is made, all Calc commands
  that manipulate items on the stack will operate on the selected
  portions of the items instead. (Note that several stack elements
  may have selections at once, though there can be only one
  selection at a time in any given stack element.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-j-e-1626" id="index-j-e-1626"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002denable_002dselections-1627" id=
  "index-calc_002denable_002dselections-1627"></a>The <kbd>j
  e</kbd> (<code>calc-enable-selections</code>) command disables
  the effect that selections have on Calc commands. The current
  selections still exist, but Calc commands operate on whole stack
  elements anyway. This mode can be identified by the fact that the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; markers on
  the line numbers are gone, even though selections are visible. To
  reactivate the selections, press <kbd>j e</kbd> again.</p>

  <p>To extract a sub-formula as a new formula, simply select the
  sub-formula and press &lt;RET&gt;. This normally duplicates the
  top stack element; here it duplicates only the selected portion
  of that element.</p>

  <p>To replace a sub-formula with something different, you can
  enter the new value onto the stack and press &lt;TAB&gt;. This
  normally exchanges the top two stack elements; here it swaps the
  value you entered into the selected portion of the formula,
  returning the old selected portion to the top of the stack.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
                3    ...                    ...                    ___
         (a + b)  . . .           17 x y . . .           17 x y + V c
     2*  ...............      2*  .............      2:  -------------
             . . . .                 . . . .                2 x + 1

                                         3                      3
     1:  17 x y               1:  (a + b)            1:  (a + b)
</pre>

  <p>In this example we select a sub-formula of our original
  example, enter a new formula, &lt;TAB&gt; it into place, then
  deselect to see the complete, edited formula.</p>

  <p>If you want to swap whole formulas around even though they
  contain selections, just use <kbd>j e</kbd> before and after.</p>

  <p><a name="index-j-_0027-1628" id=
  "index-j-_0027-1628"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002denter_002dselection-1629" id=
  "index-calc_002denter_002dselection-1629"></a>The <kbd>j '</kbd>
  (<code>calc-enter-selection</code>) command is another way to
  replace a selected sub-formula. This command does an algebraic
  entry just like the regular <kbd>'</kbd> key. When you press
  &lt;RET&gt;, the formula you type replaces the original
  selection. You can use the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol in the formula to refer to
  the original selection. If there is no selection in the formula
  under the cursor, the cursor is used to make a temporary
  selection for the purposes of the command. Thus, to change a term
  of a formula, all you have to do is move the Emacs cursor to that
  term and press <kbd>j '</kbd>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-j-_0060-1630" id=
  "index-j-_0060-1630"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dedit_002dselection-1631" id=
  "index-calc_002dedit_002dselection-1631"></a>The <kbd>j `</kbd>
  (<code>calc-edit-selection</code>) command is a similar analogue
  of the <kbd>`</kbd> (<code>calc-edit</code>) command. It edits
  the selected sub-formula in a separate buffer. If there is no
  selection, it edits the sub-formula indicated by the cursor.</p>

  <p>To delete a sub-formula, press &lt;DEL&gt;. This generally
  replaces the sub-formula with the constant zero, but in a few
  suitable contexts it uses the constant one instead. The
  &lt;DEL&gt; key automatically deselects and re-simplifies the
  entire formula afterwards. Thus:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
                   ###
         17 x y + # #          17 x y         17 # y          17 y
     1*  -------------     1:  -------    1*  -------    1:  -------
            2 x + 1            2 x + 1        2 x + 1        2 x + 1
</pre>

  <p>In this example, we first delete the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(c)</span></samp>&rsquo; term; Calc accomplishes this
  by replacing &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(c)</span></samp>&rsquo; with zero and resimplifying.
  We then delete the <kbd>x</kbd> in the numerator; since this is
  part of a product, Calc replaces it with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  resimplifies.</p>

  <p>If you select an element of a vector and press &lt;DEL&gt;,
  that element is deleted from the vector. If you delete one side
  of an equation or inequality, only the opposite side remains.</p>

  <p><a name="index-j-_0040key_007bDEL_007d-1632" id=
  "index-j-_0040key_007bDEL_007d-1632"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002ddel_002dselection-1633" id=
  "index-calc_002ddel_002dselection-1633"></a>The <kbd>j
  &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> (<code>calc-del-selection</code>) command is
  like &lt;DEL&gt; but with the auto-selecting behavior of <kbd>j
  '</kbd> and <kbd>j `</kbd>. It deletes the selected portion of
  the formula indicated by the cursor, or, in the absence of a
  selection, it deletes the sub-formula indicated by the cursor
  position.</p>

  <p><a name="index-j-_0040key_007bRET_007d-1634" id=
  "index-j-_0040key_007bRET_007d-1634"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgrab_002dselection-1635" id=
  "index-calc_002dgrab_002dselection-1635"></a>(There is also an
  auto-selecting <kbd>j &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
  (<code>calc-copy-selection</code>) command.)</p>

  <p>Normal arithmetic operations also apply to sub-formulas. Here
  we select the denominator, press <kbd>5 -</kbd> to subtract five
  from the denominator, press <kbd>n</kbd> to negate the
  denominator, then press <kbd>Q</kbd> to take the square root.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
          .. .           .. .           .. .             .. .
     1*  .......    1*  .......    1*  .......    1*  ..........
         2 x + 1        2 x - 4        4 - 2 x         _________
                                                      V 4 - 2 x
</pre>

  <p>Certain types of operations on selections are not allowed. For
  example, for an arithmetic function like <kbd>-</kbd> no more
  than one of the arguments may be a selected sub-formula. (As the
  above example shows, the result of the subtraction is spliced
  back into the argument which had the selection; if there were
  more than one selection involved, this would not be
  well-defined.) If you try to subtract two selections, the command
  will abort with an error message.</p>

  <p>Operations on sub-formulas sometimes leave the formula as a
  whole in an &ldquo;un-natural&rdquo; state. Consider negating the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x</span></samp>&rsquo; term of
  our sample formula by selecting it and pressing <kbd>n</kbd>
  (<code>calc-change-sign</code>).</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
            .. .                .. .
     1*  ..........      1*  ...........
          .........           ..........
         . . . 2 x           . . . -2 x
</pre>

  <p>Unselecting the sub-formula reveals that the minus sign, which
  would normally have cancelled out with the subtraction
  automatically, has not been able to do so because the subtraction
  was not part of the selected portion. Pressing <kbd>=</kbd>
  (<code>calc-evaluate</code>) or doing any other mathematical
  operation on the whole formula will cause it to be
  simplified.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
            17 y                17 y
     1:  -----------     1:  ----------
          __________          _________
         V 4 - -2 x          V 4 + 2 x
