  <h4 class="subsection">3.3.3 Vectors as Lists</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-Lists-43" id=
  "index-Lists-43"></a>Although Calc has a number of features for
  manipulating vectors and matrices as mathematical objects, you
  can also treat vectors as simple lists of values. For example, we
  saw that the <kbd>k f</kbd> command returns a vector which is a
  list of the prime factors of a number.</p>

  <p>You can pack and unpack stack entries into vectors:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     3:  10         1:  [10, 20, 30]     3:  10
     2:  20             .                2:  20
     1:  30                              1:  30
         .                                   .

                        M-3 v p              v u
</pre>

  <p>You can also build vectors out of consecutive integers, or out
  of many copies of a given value:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [1, 2, 3, 4]    2:  [1, 2, 3, 4]    2:  [1, 2, 3, 4]
         .               1:  17              1:  [17, 17, 17, 17]
                             .                   .

         v x 4 &lt;RET&gt;           17                  v b 4 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p>You can apply an operator to every element of a vector using
  the <dfn>map</dfn> command.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [17, 34, 51, 68]   1:  [289, 1156, 2601, 4624]  1:  [17, 34, 51, 68]
         .                      .                            .

         V M *                  2 V M ^                      V M Q
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">In the first step, we multiply the vector of
  integers by the vector of 17's elementwise. In the second step,
  we raise each element to the power two. (The general rule is that
  both operands must be vectors of the same length, or else one
  must be a vector and the other a plain number.) In the final
  step, we take the square root of each element.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Compute a vector of
  powers of two from <!-- @math{2^{-4}} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2^-4</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2^4</span></samp>&rsquo;. See
  <a href="List-Answer-1.html#List-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>You can also <dfn>reduce</dfn> a binary operator across a
  vector. For example, reducing &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; computes the product of all the
  elements in the vector:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  123123     1:  [3, 7, 11, 13, 41]      1:  123123
         .              .                           .

         123123         k f                         V R *
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">In this example, we decompose 123123 into its
  prime factors, then multiply those factors together again to
  yield the original number.</p>

  <p>We could compute a dot product &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; using
  mapping and reduction:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  [1, 2, 3]     1:  [7, 12, 0]     1:  19
     1:  [7, 6, 0]         .                  .
         .

         r 1 r 2           V M *              V R +
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Recalling two vectors from the previous
  section, we compute the sum of pairwise products of the elements
  to get the same answer for the dot product as before.</p>

  <p>A slight variant of vector reduction is the
  <dfn>accumulate</dfn> operation, <kbd>V U</kbd>. This produces a
  vector of the intermediate results from a corresponding
  reduction. Here we compute a table of factorials:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]    1:  [1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720]
         .                         .

         v x 6 &lt;RET&gt;                 V U *
</pre>

  <p>Calc allows vectors to grow as large as you like, although it
  gets rather slow if vectors have more than about a hundred
  elements. Actually, most of the time is spent formatting these
  large vectors for display, not calculating on them. Try the
  following experiment (if your computer is very fast you may need
  to substitute a larger vector size).</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [1, 2, 3, 4, ...      1:  [2, 3, 4, 5, ...
         .                         .

         v x 500 &lt;RET&gt;               1 V M +
</pre>

  <p>Now press <kbd>v .</kbd> (the letter <kbd>v</kbd>, then a
  period) and try the experiment again. In <kbd>v .</kbd> mode,
  long vectors are displayed &ldquo;abbreviated&rdquo; like
  this:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [1, 2, 3, ..., 500]   1:  [2, 3, 4, ..., 501]
         .                         .

         v x 500 &lt;RET&gt;               1 V M +
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(where now the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo; is actually part of the Calc
  display). You will find both operations are now much faster. But
  notice that even in <kbd>v&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w --> mode, the
  full vectors are still shown in the Trail. Type
  <kbd>t&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w --> to cause the trail to abbreviate
  as well, and try the experiment one more time. Operations on long
  vectors are now quite fast! (But of course if you use <kbd>t
  .</kbd> you will lose the ability to get old vectors back using
  the <kbd>t y</kbd> command.)</p>

  <p>An easy way to view a full vector when <kbd>v .</kbd> mode is
  active is to press <kbd>`</kbd> (back-quote) to edit the vector;
  editing always works with the full, unabbreviated value.</p>

  example, let's try to fit a straight line to some data, using the
  method of least squares. (Calc has a built-in command for
  least-squares curve fitting, but we'll do it by hand here just to
  practice working with vectors.) Suppose we have the following
  list of values in a file we have loaded into Emacs:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
       x        y
      ---      ---
      1.34    0.234
      1.41    0.298
      1.49    0.402
      1.56    0.412
      1.64    0.466
      1.73    0.473
      1.82    0.601
      1.91    0.519
      2.01    0.603
      2.11    0.637
      2.22    0.645
      2.33    0.705
      2.45    0.917
      2.58    1.009
      2.71    0.971
      2.85    1.062
      3.00    1.148
      3.15    1.157
      3.32    1.354
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">If you are reading this tutorial in printed
  form, you will find it easiest to press <kbd>C-x * i</kbd> to
  enter the on-line Info version of the manual and find this table
  there. (Press <kbd>g</kbd>, then type <kbd>List Tutorial</kbd>,
  to jump straight to this section.)</p>

  <p>Position the cursor at the upper-left corner of this table,
  just to the left of the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1.34</span></samp>&rsquo;. Press <kbd>C-@</kbd> to set the
  mark. (On your system this may be <kbd>C-2</kbd>,
  <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, or <kbd>NUL</kbd>.) Now position the
  cursor to the lower-right, just after the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.354</span></samp>&rsquo;. You
  have now defined this region as an Emacs &ldquo;rectangle.&rdquo;
  Still in the Info buffer, type <kbd>C-x * r</kbd>. This command
  (<code>calc-grab-rectangle</code>) will pop you back into the
  Calculator, with the contents of the rectangle you specified in
  the form of a matrix.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [ [ 1.34, 0.234 ]
           [ 1.41, 0.298 ]
           ...
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(You may wish to use <kbd>v .</kbd> mode to
  abbreviate the display of this large matrix.)</p>

  <p>We want to treat this as a pair of lists. The first step is to
  transpose this matrix into a pair of rows. Remember, a matrix is
  just a vector of vectors. So we can unpack the matrix into a pair
  of row vectors on the stack.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [ [ 1.34,  1.41,  1.49,  ... ]     2:  [1.34, 1.41, 1.49, ... ]
           [ 0.234, 0.298, 0.402, ... ] ]   1:  [0.234, 0.298, 0.402, ... ]
         .                                      .

         v t                                    v u
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Let's store these in quick variables 1 and 2,
  respectively.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [1.34, 1.41, 1.49, ... ]        .
         .

         t 2                             t 1
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(Recall that <kbd>t 2</kbd> is a variant of
  <kbd>s 2</kbd> that removes the stored value from the stack.)</p>

  <p>In a least squares fit, the slope &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; is given by the formula</p>
  <pre class="example">
     m = (N sum(x y) - sum(x) sum(y)) / (N sum(x^2) - sum(x)^2)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">where <!-- @math{\sum x} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  represents the sum of all the values of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. While there is an actual
  <code>sum</code> function in Calc, it's easier to sum a vector
  using a simple reduction. First, let's compute the four different
  sums that this formula uses.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  41.63                 1:  98.0003
         .                         .

      r 1 V R +   t 3           r 1 2 V M ^ V R +   t 4
</pre>

  <p class="noindent"></p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  13.613                1:  33.36554
         .                         .

      r 2 V R +   t 5           r 1 r 2 V M * V R +   t 6
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">These are &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sum(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sum(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sum(y)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sum(x y)</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively. (We could
  have used <kbd>*</kbd> to compute &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sum(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(x
  y)</span></samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  <p>Finally, we also need &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">N</span></samp>&rsquo;, the number of data points. This is
  just the length of either of our lists.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  19
         .

      r 1 v l   t 7
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(That's <kbd>v</kbd> followed by a lower-case
  <kbd>l</kbd>.)</p>

  <p>Now we grind through the formula:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  633.94526  2:  633.94526  1:  67.23607
         .          1:  566.70919      .
                        .

      r 7 r 6 *      r 3 r 5 *         -
</pre>

  <p class="noindent"></p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  67.23607   3:  67.23607   2:  67.23607   1:  0.52141679
     1:  1862.0057  2:  1862.0057  1:  128.9488       .
         .          1:  1733.0569      .
                        .

      r 7 r 4 *      r 3 2 ^           -              /   t 8
</pre>

  <p>That gives us the slope &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo;. The y-intercept
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; can now be
  found with the simple formula,</p>
  <pre class="example">
     b = (sum(y) - m sum(x)) / N
</pre>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  13.613     2:  13.613     1:  -8.09358   1:  -0.425978
         .          1:  21.70658       .              .
                        .

        r 5            r 8 r 3 *       -              r 7 /   t 9
</pre>

  <p>Let's &ldquo;plot&rdquo; this straight line approximation,
  <!-- @math{y \approx m x + b}, -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m x + b</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  and compare it with the original data.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [0.699, 0.735, ... ]    1:  [0.273, 0.309, ... ]
         .                           .

         r 1 r 8 *                   r 9 +    s 0
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Notice that multiplying a vector by a
  constant, and adding a constant to a vector, can be done without
  mapping commands since these are common operations from vector
  algebra. As far as Calc is concerned, we've just been doing
  geometry in 19-dimensional space!</p>

  <p>We can subtract this vector from our original
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; vector to
  get a feel for the error of our fit. Let's find the maximum
  error:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [0.0387, 0.0112, ... ]   1:  [0.0387, 0.0112, ... ]   1:  0.0897
         .                            .                            .

         r 2 -                        V M A                        V R X
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">First we compute a vector of differences,
  then we take the absolute values of these differences, then we
  reduce the <code>max</code> function across the vector. (The
  <code>max</code> function is on the two-key sequence <kbd>f
  x</kbd>; because it is so common to use <code>max</code> in a
  vector operation, the letters <kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>N</kbd> are
  also accepted for <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> in this
  context. In general, you answer the <kbd>V M</kbd> or <kbd>V
  R</kbd> prompt with the actual key sequence that invokes the
  function you want. You could have typed <kbd>V R f x</kbd> or
  even <kbd>V R x max &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> if you had preferred.)</p>

  <p>If your system has the GNUPLOT program, you can see graphs of
  your data and your straight line to see how well they match. (If
  you have GNUPLOT 3.0 or higher, the following instructions will
  work regardless of the kind of display you have. Some GNUPLOT
  2.0, non-X-windows systems may require additional steps to view
  the graphs.)</p>

  <p>Let's start by plotting the original data. Recall the
  &ldquo;<var>x</var>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<var>y</var>&rdquo; vectors
  onto the stack and press <kbd>g f</kbd>. This &ldquo;fast&rdquo;
  graphing command does everything you need to do for simple,
  straightforward plotting of data.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">

  <p>If all goes well, you will shortly get a new window containing
  a graph of the data. (If not, contact your GNUPLOT or Calc
  installer to find out what went wrong.) In the X window system,
  this will be a separate graphics window. For other kinds of
  displays, the default is to display the graph in Emacs itself
  using rough character graphics. Press <kbd>q</kbd> when you are

  3.</strong> If the input data do not form a rectangle, you can
  use <kbd>C-x&nbsp;*&nbsp;g</kbd><!-- /@w -->
   (<code>calc-grab-region</code>) to grab the data the way Emacs
  normally works with regions&mdash;it reads left-to-right,
  top-to-bottom, treating line breaks the same as spaces. Use this
  command to find the geometric mean of the following numbers. (The
  geometric mean is the <var>n</var>th root of the product of
  <var>n</var> numbers.)</p>
  <pre class="example">
     2.3  6  22  15.1  7
       15  14  7.5
       2.5
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The <kbd>C-x * g</kbd> command accepts
  numbers separated by spaces or commas, with or without
  surrounding vector brackets. See <a href=
  "List-Answer-3.html#List-Answer-3">3</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>As another example, a theorem about binomial coefficients
  tells us that the alternating sum of binomial coefficients
  <var>n</var>-choose-0 minus <var>n</var>-choose-1 plus
  <var>n</var>-choose-2, and so on up to
  <var>n</var>-choose-<var>n</var>, always comes out to zero. Let's
  verify this for &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n=6</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]     1:  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [1, -6, 15, -20, 15, -6, 1]          1:  0
         .                                        .

         V M ' (-1)^$ choose(6,$) &lt;RET&gt;             V R +
</pre>

  <p>The <kbd>V M '</kbd> command prompts you to enter any
  algebraic expression to define the function to map over the
  vector. The symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; inside this expression represents
  the argument to the function. The Calculator applies this formula
  to each element of the vector, substituting each element's value
  for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;
  sign(s) in turn.</p>

  <p>To define a two-argument function, use
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$$</span></samp>&rsquo; for the
  first argument and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; for the second: <kbd>V M ' $$-$
  &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> is equivalent to <kbd>V M -</kbd>. This is
  analogous to regular algebraic entry, where
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$$</span></samp>&rsquo; would
  refer to the next-to-top stack entry and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; would
  refer to the top stack entry, and <kbd>' $$-$ &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
  would act exactly like <kbd>-</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Notice that the <kbd>V M '</kbd> command has recorded two
  things in the trail: The result, as usual, and also a
  funny-looking thing marked &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">oper</span></samp>&rsquo; that represents the operator
  function you typed in. The function is enclosed in
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt; &gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  brackets, and the argument is denoted by a
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; sign. If
  there were several arguments, they would be shown as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#1</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#2</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so
  on. (For example, <kbd>V M ' $$-$</kbd> will put the function
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;#1 -
  #2&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; on the trail.) This object is a
  &ldquo;nameless function&rdquo;; you can use nameless
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&lt;&nbsp;&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> notation
  to answer the <kbd>V M '</kbd> prompt if you like. Nameless
  function notation has the interesting, occasionally useful
  property that a nameless function is not actually evaluated until
  it is used. For example, <kbd>V M ' $+random(2.0)</kbd> evaluates
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">random(2.0)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  once and adds that random number to all elements of the vector,
  but <kbd>V M ' &lt;#+random(2.0)&gt;</kbd> evaluates the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">random(2.0)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  separately for each vector element.</p>

  <p>Another group of operators that are often useful with <kbd>V
  M</kbd> are the relational operators: <kbd>a =</kbd>, for
  example, compares two numbers and gives the result 1 if they are
  equal, or 0 if not. Similarly, <kbd>a&nbsp;&lt;</kbd><!-- /@w -->
   checks for one number being less than another.</p>

  <p>Other useful vector operations include <kbd>v v</kbd>, to
  reverse a vector end-for-end; <kbd>V S</kbd>, to sort the
  elements of a vector into increasing order; and <kbd>v r</kbd>
  and <kbd>v&nbsp;c</kbd><!-- /@w -->, to extract one row or column
  of a matrix, or (in both cases) to extract one element of a plain
  vector. With a negative argument, <kbd>v r</kbd> and <kbd>v
  c</kbd> instead delete one row, column, or vector element.</p>

  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[104, 101, 108, 108,

  a <dfn>hash code</dfn> of a string, which is just an integer that
  represents the value of that string. Two equal strings have the
  same hash code; two different strings <dfn>probably</dfn> have
  different hash codes. (For example, Calc has over 400 function
  names, but Emacs can quickly find the definition for any given
  name because it has sorted the functions into
  &ldquo;buckets&rdquo; by their hash codes. Sometimes a few names
  will hash into the same bucket, but it is easier to search among
  a few names than among all the names.) One popular hash function
  is computed as follows: First set &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">h = 0</span></samp>&rsquo;. Then, for each character from
  the string in turn, set &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h = 3h +
  c_i</span></samp>&rsquo; where &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">c_i</span></samp>&rsquo; is the character's ASCII code. If
  we have 511 buckets, we then take the hash code modulo 511 to get
  the bucket number. Develop a simple command or commands for
  converting string vectors into hash codes. The hash code for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"Testing, 1, 2,
  3"</span></samp>&rsquo; is 1960915098, which modulo 511 is 121.
