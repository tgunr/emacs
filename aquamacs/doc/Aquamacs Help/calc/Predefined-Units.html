  <h3 class="section">12.3 Predefined Units</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The definitions of many units have changed
  over the years. For example, the meter was originally defined in
  1791 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the
  north pole. In order to be more precise, the definition was
  adjusted several times, and now a meter is defined as the
  distance that light will travel in a vacuum in 1/299792458 of a
  second; consequently, the speed of light in a vacuum is exactly
  299792458 m/s. Many other units have been redefined in terms of
  fundamental physical processes; a second, for example, is
  currently defined as 9192631770 periods of a certain radiation
  related to the cesium-133 atom. The only SI unit that is not
  based on a fundamental physical process (although there are
  efforts to change this) is the kilogram, which was originally
  defined as the mass of one liter of water, but is now defined as
  the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK), a
  cylinder of platinum-iridium kept at the Bureau International des
  Poids et Mesures in S&egrave;vres, France. (There are several
  copies of the IPK throughout the world.) The British imperial
  units, once defined in terms of physical objects, were redefined
  in 1963 in terms of SI units. The US customary units, which were
  the same as British units until the British imperial system was
  created in 1824, were also defined in terms of the SI units in
  1893. Because of these redefinitions, conversions between metric,
  British Imperial, and US customary units can often be done
  precisely.</p>

  <p>Since the exact definitions of many kinds of units have
  evolved over the years, and since certain countries sometimes
  have local differences in their definitions, it is a good idea to
  examine Calc's definition of a unit before depending on its exact
  value. For example, there are three different units for gallons,
  corresponding to the US (<code>gal</code>), Canadian
  (<code>galC</code>), and British (<code>galUK</code>)
  definitions. Also, note that <code>oz</code> is a standard ounce
  of mass, <code>ozt</code> is a Troy ounce, and <code>ozfl</code>
  is a fluid ounce.</p>

  <p>The temperature units corresponding to degrees Kelvin and
  Centigrade (Celsius) are the same in this table, since most units
  commands treat temperatures as being relative. The
  <code>calc-convert-temperature</code> command has special rules
  for handling the different absolute magnitudes of the various
  temperature scales.</p>

  <p>The unit of volume &ldquo;liters&rdquo; can be referred to by
  either the lower-case <code>l</code> or the upper-case
  <code>L</code>.</p>

  <p>The unit <code>A</code> stands for Amperes; the name
  <code>Ang</code> is used for Angstroms.</p>

  <p>The unit <code>pt</code> stands for pints; the name
  <code>point</code> stands for a typographical point, defined by
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">72 point = 1
  in</span></samp>&rsquo;. This is slightly different than the
  point defined by the American Typefounder's Association in 1886,
  but the point used by Calc has become standard largely due to its
  use by the PostScript page description language. There is also
  <code>texpt</code>, which stands for a printer's point as defined
  by the TeX typesetting system: &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">72.27 texpt = 1 in</span></samp>&rsquo;. Other units used
  by TeX are available; they are <code>texpc</code> (a pica),
  <code>texbp</code> (a &ldquo;big point&rdquo;, equal to a
  standard point which is larger than the point used by TeX),
  <code>texdd</code> (a Didot point), <code>texcc</code> (a Cicero)
  and <code>texsp</code> (a scaled TeX point, all dimensions
  representable in TeX are multiples of this value).</p>

  <p>When Calc is using the TeX or LaTeX language mode (see
  <a href="TeX-and-LaTeX-Language-Modes.html#TeX-and-LaTeX-Language-Modes">
  TeX and LaTeX Language Modes</a>), the TeX specific unit names
  will not use the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">tex</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix; the unit name for a TeX
  point will be &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">pt</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">texpt</span></samp>&rsquo;, for
  example. To avoid conflicts, the unit names for pint and parsec
  will simply be &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">pint</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">parsec</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pt</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pc</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The unit <code>e</code> stands for the elementary (electron)
  unit of charge; because algebra command could mistake this for
  the special constant &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo;, Calc provides the alternate unit
  name <code>ech</code> which is preferable to <code>e</code>.</p>

  <p>The name <code>g</code> stands for one gram of mass; there is
  also <code>gf</code>, one gram of force. (Likewise for
  <kbd>lb</kbd>, pounds, and <kbd>lbf</kbd>.) Meanwhile, one
  &ldquo;&lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo;&rdquo; of acceleration is denoted
  <code>ga</code>.</p>

  <p>The unit <code>ton</code> is a U.S. ton of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2000 lb</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  <code>t</code> is a metric ton of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1000 kg</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The names <code>s</code> (or <code>sec</code>) and
  <code>min</code> refer to units of time; <code>arcsec</code> and
  <code>arcmin</code> are units of angle.</p>

  <p>Some &ldquo;units&rdquo; are really physical constants; for
  example, <code>c</code> represents the speed of light, and
  <code>h</code> represents Planck's constant. You can use these
  just like other units: converting &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">.5 c</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">m/s</span></samp>&rsquo; expresses one-half the speed of
  light in meters per second. You can also use this merely as a
  handy reference; the <kbd>u g</kbd> command gets the definition
  of one of these constants in its normal terms, and <kbd>u b</kbd>
  expresses the definition in base units.</p>

  <p>Two units, <code>pi</code> and <code>alpha</code> (the fine
  structure constant, approximately <i>1/137</i>) are
  dimensionless. The units simplification commands simply treat
  these names as equivalent to their corresponding values. However
  you can, for example, use <kbd>u c</kbd> to convert a pure number
  into multiples of the fine structure constant, or <kbd>u b</kbd>
  to convert this back into a pure number. (When <kbd>u c</kbd>
  prompts for the &ldquo;old units,&rdquo; just enter a blank line
  to signify that the value really is unitless.)
