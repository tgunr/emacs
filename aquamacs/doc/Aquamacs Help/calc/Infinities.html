  "index-nan-248"></a>The word <code>inf</code> represents the
  mathematical concept of <dfn>infinity</dfn>. Calc actually has
  three slightly different infinity-like values: <code>inf</code>,
  <code>uinf</code>, and <code>nan</code>. These are just regular
  variable names (see <a href=
  "Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>); you should avoid using
  these names for your own variables because Calc gives them
  special treatment. Infinities, like all variable names, are
  normally entered using algebraic entry.</p>

  <p>Mathematically speaking, it is not rigorously correct to treat
  &ldquo;infinity&rdquo; as if it were a number, but mathematicians
  often do so informally. When they say that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / inf = 0</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  what they really mean is that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 /
  x</span></samp>&rsquo;, as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; becomes larger and larger, becomes
  arbitrarily close to zero. So you can imagine that if
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; got
  &ldquo;all the way to infinity,&rdquo; then
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / x</span></samp>&rsquo; would
  go all the way to zero. Similarly, when they say that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(inf) =
  inf</span></samp>&rsquo;, they mean that <!-- @math{e^x} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  grows without bound as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; grows. The symbol
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo;
  likewise stands for an infinitely negative real value; for
  example, we say that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(-inf) =
  0</span></samp>&rsquo;. You can have an infinity pointing in any
  direction on the complex plane: &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sqrt(-inf) = i inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The same concept of limits can be used to define
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0</span></samp>&rsquo;. We
  really want the value that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 /
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; approaches as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; approaches zero. But if all we have
  is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0</span></samp>&rsquo;, we
  can't tell which direction &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; was coming from. If
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; was
  positive and decreasing toward zero, then we should say that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0 = inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  But if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; was
  negative and increasing toward zero, the answer is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0 =
  -inf</span></samp>&rsquo;. In fact, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; could be an imaginary number,
  giving the answer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i
  inf</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-i
  inf</span></samp>&rsquo;. Calc uses the special symbol
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">uinf</span></samp>&rsquo; to mean
  <dfn>undirected infinity</dfn>, i.e., a value which is infinitely
  large but with an unknown sign (or direction on the complex
  plane).</p>

  <p>Calc actually has three modes that say how infinities are
  handled. Normally, infinities never arise from calculations that
  didn't already have them. Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1
  / 0</span></samp>&rsquo; is treated simply as an error and left
  unevaluated. The <kbd>m i</kbd> (<code>calc-infinite-mode</code>)
  command (see <a href="Infinite-Mode.html#Infinite-Mode">Infinite
  Mode</a>) enables a mode in which &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1 / 0</span></samp>&rsquo; evaluates to <code>uinf</code>
  instead. There is also an alternative type of infinite mode which
  says to treat zeros as if they were positive, so that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0 = inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  While this is less mathematically correct, it may be the answer
  you want in some cases.</p>

  <p>Since all infinities are &ldquo;as large&rdquo; as all others,
  Calc simplifies, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5
  inf</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">inf</span></samp>&rsquo;. Another example is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5 - inf =
  -inf</span></samp>&rsquo;, where the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo; is so large that adding a finite
  number like five to it does not affect it. Note that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a - inf</span></samp>&rsquo; also
  results in &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo;; Calc assumes that variables
  like <code>a</code> always stand for finite quantities. Just to
  show that infinities really are all the same size, note that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(inf) = inf^2 = exp(inf) =
  inf</span></samp>&rsquo; in Calc's notation.</p>

  <p>It's not so easy to define certain formulas like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0 * inf</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf / inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  Depending on where these zeros and infinities came from, the
  answer could be literally anything. The latter formula could be
  the limit of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x /
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; (giving a result of one), or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x / x</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (giving two), or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2 /
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; (giving <code>inf</code>), or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x / x^2</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (giving zero). Calc uses the symbol <code>nan</code> to represent
  such an <dfn>indeterminate</dfn> value. (The name
  &ldquo;nan&rdquo; comes from analogy with the &ldquo;NAN&rdquo;
  concept of IEEE standard arithmetic; it stands for &ldquo;Not A
  Number.&rdquo; This is somewhat of a misnomer, since
  <code>nan</code> <em>does</em> stand for some number or infinity,
  it's just that <em>which</em> number it stands for cannot be
  determined.) In Calc's notation, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">0 * inf = nan</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf / inf =
  nan</span></samp>&rsquo;. A few other common indeterminate
  expressions are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf -
  inf</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf
  ^ 0</span></samp>&rsquo;. Also, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0
  / 0 = nan</span></samp>&rsquo; if you have turned on Infinite
  mode (as described above).</p>

  <p>Infinities are especially useful as parts of
  <dfn>intervals</dfn>. See <a href=
  "Interval-Forms.html#Interval-Forms">Interval Forms</a>.</p>
