  <h3 class="section">17.5 Customizing Embedded Mode</h3>

  <p class="noindent">You can modify Embedded mode's behavior by
  setting various Lisp variables described here. These variables
  are customizable (see <a href=
  "Customizing-Calc.html#Customizing-Calc">Customizing Calc</a>),
  or you can use <kbd>M-x set-variable</kbd> or <kbd>M-x
  edit-options</kbd> to adjust a variable on the fly. (Another
  possibility would be to use a file-local variable annotation at
  the end of the file; see <a href=
  "../emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">Local Variables in
  Files</a>.) Many of the variables given mentioned here can be set
  to depend on the major mode of the editing buffer (see <a href=
  "Customizing-Calc.html#Customizing-Calc">Customizing
  Calc</a>).</p>

  <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dformula-2247"
  id="index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dformula-2247"></a>The
  <code>calc-embedded-open-formula</code> variable holds a regular
  expression for the opening delimiter of a formula. See <a href=
  "../emacs/Regexp-Search.html#Regexp-Search">Regular Expression
  Search</a>, to see how regular expressions work. Basically, a
  regular expression is a pattern that Calc can search for. A
  regular expression that considers blank lines,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$$</span></samp>&rsquo; to be
  opening delimiters is <code>"\\`\\|^\n\\|\\$\\$?"</code>. Just in
  case the meaning of this regular expression is not completely
  plain, let's go through it in detail.</p>

  <p>The surrounding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"
  "</span></samp>&rsquo; marks quote the text between them as a
  Lisp string. If you left them off, <code>set-variable</code> or
  <code>edit-options</code> would try to read the regular
  expression as a Lisp program.</p>

  <p>The most obvious property of this regular expression is that
  it contains indecently many backslashes. There are actually two
  levels of backslash usage going on here. First, when Lisp reads a
  quoted string, all pairs of characters beginning with a backslash
  are interpreted as special characters. Here, <code>\n</code>
  changes to a new-line character, and <code>\\</code> changes to a
  single backslash. So the actual regular expression seen by Calc
  is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\`\|^ (newline)
  \|\$\$?</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Regular expressions also consider pairs beginning with
  backslash to have special meanings. Sometimes the backslash is
  used to quote a character that otherwise would have a special
  meaning in a regular expression, like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, which normally means
  &ldquo;end-of-line,&rdquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, which means that the preceding
  item is optional. So &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">\$\$?</span></samp>&rsquo; matches either one or two
  dollar signs.</p>

  <p>The other codes in this regular expression are
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
  matches &ldquo;beginning-of-line,&rdquo;
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
  means &ldquo;or,&rdquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">\`</span></samp>&rsquo;, which matches
  &ldquo;beginning-of-buffer.&rdquo; So the whole pattern means
  that a formula begins at the beginning of the buffer, or on a
  newline that occurs at the beginning of a line (i.e., a blank
  line), or at one or two dollar signs.</p>

  <p>The default value of <code>calc-embedded-open-formula</code>
  looks just like this example, with several more alternatives
  added on to recognize various other common kinds of
  delimiters.</p>

  <p>By the way, the reason to use &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">^\n</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^$</span></samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n\n</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
  also would appear to match blank lines, is that the former
  expression actually &ldquo;consumes&rdquo; only one newline
  character as <em>part of</em> the delimiter, whereas the latter
  expressions consume zero or two newlines, respectively. The
  former choice gives the most natural behavior when Calc must
  operate on a whole formula including its delimiters.</p>

  <p>See the Emacs manual for complete details on regular
  expressions. But just for your convenience, here is a list of all
  characters which must be quoted with backslash (like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\$</span></samp>&rsquo;) to avoid
  some special interpretation: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">. *
  + ? [ ] ^ $ \</span></samp>&rsquo;. (Note the backslash in this
  list; for example, to match &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">\[</span></samp>&rsquo; you must use
  <code>"\\\\\\["</code>. An exercise for the reader is to account
  for each of these six backslashes!)</p>

  <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dformula-2248"
  id="index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dformula-2248"></a>The
  <code>calc-embedded-close-formula</code> variable holds a regular
  expression for the closing delimiter of a formula. A closing
  regular expression to match the above example would be
  <code>"\\'\\|\n$\\|\\$\\$?"</code>. This is almost the same as
  the other one, except it now uses &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">\'</span></samp>&rsquo; (&ldquo;end-of-buffer&rdquo;) and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n$</span></samp>&rsquo; (newline
  occurring at end of line, yet another way of describing a blank
  line that is more appropriate for this case).</p>

  <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dword_002dregexp-2249" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dword_002dregexp-2249"></a>The
  <code>calc-embedded-word-regexp</code> variable holds a regular
  expression used to define an expression to look for (a
  &ldquo;word&rdquo;) when you type <kbd>C-x * w</kbd> to enable
  Embedded mode.</p>

  <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dplain-2250" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dplain-2250"></a>The
  <code>calc-embedded-open-plain</code> variable is a string which
  begins a &ldquo;plain&rdquo; formula written in front of the
  formatted formula when <kbd>d p</kbd> mode is turned on. Note
  that this is an actual string, not a regular expression, because
  Calc must be able to write this string into a buffer as well as
  to recognize it. The default string is <code>"%%% "</code> (note
  the trailing space), but may be different for certain major
  modes.</p>

  <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dplain-2251" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dplain-2251"></a>The
  <code>calc-embedded-close-plain</code> variable is a string which
  ends a &ldquo;plain&rdquo; formula. The default is <code>"
  %%%\n"</code>, but may be different for different major modes.
  Without the trailing newline here, the first line of a Big mode
  formula that followed might be shifted over with respect to the
  other lines.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dnew_002dformula-2252" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dnew_002dformula-2252"></a>The
  <code>calc-embedded-open-new-formula</code> variable is a string
  which is inserted at the front of a new formula when you type
  <kbd>C-x * f</kbd>. Its default value is <code>"\n\n"</code>. If
  this string begins with a newline character and the <kbd>C-x *
  f</kbd> is typed at the beginning of a line, <kbd>C-x * f</kbd>
  will skip this first newline to avoid introducing unnecessary
  blank lines in the file.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dnew_002dformula-2253" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dnew_002dformula-2253"></a>The
  <code>calc-embedded-close-new-formula</code> variable is the
  corresponding string which is inserted at the end of a new
  formula. Its default value is also <code>"\n\n"</code>. The final
  newline is omitted by <kbd>C-x&nbsp;*&nbsp;f</kbd><!-- /@w --> if
  typed at the end of a line. (It follows that if <kbd>C-x *
  f</kbd> is typed on a blank line, both a leading opening newline
  and a trailing closing newline are omitted.)</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dannounce_002dformula-2254" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dannounce_002dformula-2254"></a>The
  <code>calc-embedded-announce-formula</code> variable is a regular
  expression which is sure to be followed by an embedded formula.
  The <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> command searches for this pattern as well
  as for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo;
  operators. Note that <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> will not activate just
  anything surrounded by formula delimiters; after all, blank lines
  are considered formula delimiters by default! But if your
  language includes a delimiter which can only occur actually in
  front of a formula, you can take advantage of it here. The
  default pattern is <code>"%Embed\n\\(% .*\n\\)*"</code>, but may
  be different for different major modes. This pattern will check
  for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%Embed</span></samp>&rsquo;
  followed by any number of lines beginning with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; and a
  space. This last is important to make Calc consider mode
  annotations part of the pattern, so that the formula's opening
  delimiter really is sure to follow the pattern.</p>

  <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dmode-2255" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dmode-2255"></a>The
  <code>calc-embedded-open-mode</code> variable is a string (not a
  regular expression) which should precede a mode annotation. Calc
  never scans for this string; Calc always looks for the annotation
  itself. But this is the string that is inserted before the
  opening bracket when Calc adds an annotation on its own. The
  default is <code>"% "</code>, but may be different for different
  major modes.</p>

  <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dmode-2256" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dmode-2256"></a>The
  <code>calc-embedded-close-mode</code> variable is a string which
  follows a mode annotation written by Calc. Its default value is
  simply a newline, <code>"\n"</code>, but may be different for
  different major modes. If you change this, it is a good idea
  still to end with a newline so that mode annotations will appear
  on lines by themselves.</p>
