  <h3 class="section">15.6 Yanking into Other Buffers</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-y-2216" id=
  "index-y-2216"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dcopy_002dto_002dbuffer-2217" id=
  "index-calc_002dcopy_002dto_002dbuffer-2217"></a>The plain
  <kbd>y</kbd> (<code>calc-copy-to-buffer</code>) command inserts
  the number at the top of the stack into the most recently used
  normal editing buffer. (More specifically, this is the most
  recently used buffer which is displayed in a window and whose
  name does not begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;. If there is no such buffer, this
  is the most recently used buffer except for Calculator and Calc
  Trail buffers.) The number is inserted exactly as it appears and
  without a newline. (If line-numbering is enabled, the line number
  is normally not included.) The number is <em>not</em> removed
  from the stack.</p>

  <p>With a prefix argument, <kbd>y</kbd> inserts several numbers,
  one per line. A positive argument inserts the specified number of
  values from the top of the stack. A negative argument inserts the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;th value
  from the top of the stack. An argument of zero inserts the entire
  stack. Note that <kbd>y</kbd> with an argument of 1 is slightly
  different from <kbd>y</kbd> with no argument; the former always
  copies full lines, whereas the latter strips off the trailing
  newline.</p>

  <p>With a lone <kbd>C-u</kbd> as a prefix argument, <kbd>y</kbd>
  <em>replaces</em> the region in the other buffer with the yanked
  text, then quits the Calculator, leaving you in that buffer. A
  typical use would be to use <kbd>C-x * g</kbd> to read a region
  of data into the Calculator, operate on the data to produce a new
  matrix, then type <kbd>C-u y</kbd> to replace the original data
  with the new data. One might wish to alter the matrix display
  style (see <a href=
  "Vector-and-Matrix-Formats.html#Vector-and-Matrix-Formats">Vector
  and Matrix Formats</a>) or change the current display language
  (see <a href="Language-Modes.html#Language-Modes">Language
  Modes</a>) before doing this. Also, note that this command
  replaces a linear region of text (as grabbed by <kbd>C-x *
  g</kbd>), not a rectangle (as grabbed by <kbd>C-x * r</kbd>).</p>

  <p>If the editing buffer is in overwrite (as opposed to insert)
  mode, and the <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix was not used, then the yanked
  number will overwrite the characters following point rather than
  being inserted before those characters. The usual conventions of
  overwrite mode are observed; for example, characters will be
  inserted at the end of a line rather than overflowing onto the
  next line. Yanking a multi-line object such as a matrix in
  overwrite mode overwrites the next <var>n</var> lines in the
  buffer, lengthening or shortening each line as necessary.
  Finally, if the thing being yanked is a simple integer or
  floating-point number (like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-1.2345e-3</span></samp>&rsquo;) and the characters
  following point also make up such a number, then Calc will
  replace that number with the new number, lengthening or
  shortening as necessary. The concept of &ldquo;overwrite
  mode&rdquo; has thus been generalized from overwriting characters
  to overwriting one complete number with another.</p>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-y-2218" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-y-2218"></a>The <kbd>C-x * y</kbd> key
  sequence is equivalent to <kbd>y</kbd> except that it can be
  typed anywhere, not just in Calc. This provides an easy way to
  guarantee that Calc knows which editing buffer you want to
  use!</p>
