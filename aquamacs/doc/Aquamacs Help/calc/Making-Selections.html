  <h4 class="subsection">11.1.1 Making Selections</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-j-s-1595" id=
  "index-j-s-1595"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dselect_002dhere-1596" id=
  "index-calc_002dselect_002dhere-1596"></a>To select a
  sub-formula, move the Emacs cursor to any character in that
  sub-formula, and press <kbd>j&nbsp;s</kbd><!-- /@w -->
   (<code>calc-select-here</code>). Calc will highlight the
  smallest portion of the formula that contains that character. By
  default the sub-formula is highlighted by blanking out all of the
  rest of the formula with dots. Selection works in any display
  mode but is perhaps easiest in Big mode (<kbd>d B</kbd>). Suppose
  you enter the following formula:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
                3    ___
         (a + b)  + V c
     1:  ---------------
             2 x + 1
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(by typing <kbd>' ((a+b)^3 + sqrt(c)) /
  (2x+1)</kbd>). If you move the cursor to the letter
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; and press
  <kbd>j&nbsp;s</kbd><!-- /@w -->, the display changes to</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
                .    ...
         .. . b.  . . .
     1*  ...............
             . . . .
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Every character not part of the sub-formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; has been
  changed to a dot. (If the customizable variable
  <code>calc-highlight-selections-with-faces</code> is non-nil,
  then the characters not part of the sub-formula are de-emphasized
  by using a less noticeable face instead of using dots. see
  <a href=
  "Displaying-Selections.html#Displaying-Selections">Displaying
  Selections</a>.) The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; next to the line number is to
  remind you that the formula has a portion of it selected. (In
  this case, it's very obvious, but it might not always be. If
  Embedded mode is enabled, the word &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Sel</span></samp>&rsquo; also appears in the mode line
  because the stack may not be visible. see <a href=
  "Embedded-Mode.html#Embedded-Mode">Embedded Mode</a>.)</p>

  <p>If you had instead placed the cursor on the parenthesis
  immediately to the right of the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, the selection would have been:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
                .    ...
         (a + b)  . . .
     1*  ...............
             . . . .
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The portion selected is always large enough
  to be considered a complete formula all by itself, so selecting
  the parenthesis selects the whole formula that it encloses.
  Putting the cursor on the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; sign would have had the same
  effect.</p>

  <p>(Strictly speaking, the Emacs cursor is really the
  manifestation of the Emacs &ldquo;point,&rdquo; which is a
  position <em>between</em> two characters in the buffer. So
  purists would say that Calc selects the smallest sub-formula
  which contains the character to the right of
  &ldquo;point.&rdquo;)</p>

  <p>If you supply a numeric prefix argument <var>n</var>, the
  selection is expanded to the <var>n</var>th enclosing
  sub-formula. Thus, positioning the cursor on the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; and typing
  <kbd>C-u 1 j s</kbd> will select &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a + b</span></samp>&rsquo;; typing <kbd>C-u 2 j s</kbd>
  will select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a +
  b)^3</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on.</p>

  <p>If the cursor is not on any part of the formula, or if you
  give a numeric prefix that is too large, the entire formula is
  selected.</p>

  <p>If the cursor is on the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; line that marks the top of the
  stack (i.e., its normal &ldquo;rest position&rdquo;), this
  command selects the entire formula at stack level 1. Most
  selection commands similarly operate on the formula at the top of
  the stack if you haven't positioned the cursor on any stack
  entry.</p>

  "index-calc_002dselect_002dadditional-1598" id=
  "index-calc_002dselect_002dadditional-1598"></a>The <kbd>j
  a</kbd> (<code>calc-select-additional</code>) command enlarges
  the current selection to encompass the cursor. To select the
  smallest sub-formula defined by two different points, move to the
  first and press <kbd>j s</kbd>, then move to the other and press
  <kbd>j a</kbd>. This is roughly analogous to using <kbd>C-@</kbd>
  (<code>set-mark-command</code>) to select the two ends of a
  region of text during normal Emacs editing.</p>

  <p><a name="index-j-o-1599" id="index-j-o-1599"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dselect_002donce-1600" id=
  "index-calc_002dselect_002donce-1600"></a>The <kbd>j o</kbd>
  (<code>calc-select-once</code>) command selects a formula in
  exactly the same way as <kbd>j s</kbd>, except that the selection
  will last only as long as the next command that uses it. For
  example, <kbd>j o 1 +</kbd> is a handy way to add one to the
  sub-formula indicated by the cursor.</p>

  <p>(A somewhat more precise definition: The <kbd>j o</kbd>
  command sets a flag such that the next command involving selected
  stack entries will clear the selections on those stack entries
  afterwards. All other selection commands except <kbd>j a</kbd>
  and <kbd>j O</kbd> clear this flag.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-j-S-1601" id="index-j-S-1601"></a><a name=
  "index-j-O-1602" id="index-j-O-1602"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dselect_002dhere_002dmaybe-1603" id=
  "index-calc_002dselect_002dhere_002dmaybe-1603"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dselect_002donce_002dmaybe-1604" id=
  "index-calc_002dselect_002donce_002dmaybe-1604"></a>The <kbd>j
  S</kbd> (<code>calc-select-here-maybe</code>) and <kbd>j O</kbd>
  (<code>calc-select-once-maybe</code>) commands are equivalent to
  <kbd>j s</kbd> and <kbd>j o</kbd>, respectively, except that if
  the formula already has a selection they have no effect. This is
  analogous to the behavior of some commands such as <kbd>j r</kbd>
  (<code>calc-rewrite-selection</code>; see <a href=
  "Selections-with-Rewrite-Rules.html#Selections-with-Rewrite-Rules">
  Selections with Rewrite Rules</a>) and is mainly intended to be
  used in keyboard macros that implement your own
  selection-oriented commands.</p>

  <p>Selection of sub-formulas normally treats associative terms
  like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b - c +
  d</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x * y
  * z</span></samp>&rsquo; as single levels of the formula. If you
  place the cursor anywhere inside &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a + b - c + d</span></samp>&rsquo; except on one of the
  variable names and use <kbd>j s</kbd>, you will select the entire
  four-term sum.</p>

  <p><a name="index-j-b-1605" id="index-j-b-1605"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dbreak_002dselections-1606" id=
  "index-calc_002dbreak_002dselections-1606"></a>The <kbd>j b</kbd>
  (<code>calc-break-selections</code>) command controls a mode in
  which the &ldquo;deep structure&rdquo; of these associative
  formulas shows through. Calc actually stores the above formulas
  as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">((a + b) - c) +
  d</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x * (y
  * z)</span></samp>&rsquo;. (Note that for certain obscure
  reasons, by default Calc treats multiplication as
  right-associative.) Once you have enabled <kbd>j b</kbd> mode,
  selecting with the cursor on the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; sign would only select the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b - c</span></samp>&rsquo;
  portion, which makes sense when the deep structure of the sum is
  considered. There is no way to select the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b - c + d</span></samp>&rsquo;
  portion; although this might initially look like just as
  legitimate a sub-formula as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b
  - c</span></samp>&rsquo;, the deep structure shows that it isn't.
  The <kbd>d U</kbd> command can be used to view the deep structure
  of any formula (see <a href=
  "Normal-Language-Modes.html#Normal-Language-Modes">Normal
  Language Modes</a>).</p>

  <p>When <kbd>j b</kbd> mode has not been enabled, the deep
  structure is generally hidden by the selection
  commands&mdash;what you see is what you get.</p>

  <p><a name="index-j-u-1607" id="index-j-u-1607"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dunselect-1608" id=
  "index-calc_002dunselect-1608"></a>The <kbd>j u</kbd>
  (<code>calc-unselect</code>) command unselects the formula that
  the cursor is on. If there was no selection in the formula, this
  command has no effect. With a numeric prefix argument, it
  unselects the <var>n</var>th stack element rather than using the
  cursor position.</p>

  "index-calc_002dclear_002dselections-1610"></a>The <kbd>j c</kbd>
  (<code>calc-clear-selections</code>) command unselects all stack
  elements.</p>
