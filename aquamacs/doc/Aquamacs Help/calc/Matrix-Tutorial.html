  <h4 class="subsection">3.3.2 Matrices</h4>

  <p class="noindent">A <dfn>matrix</dfn> is just a vector of
  vectors, all the same length. This means you can enter a matrix
  using nested brackets. You can also use the semicolon character
  to enter a matrix. We'll show both methods here:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]             1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]                 [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]
         .                             .

       [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]             ' [1 2 3; 4 5 6] &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">We'll be using this matrix again, so type
  <kbd>s 4</kbd> to save it now.</p>

  <p>Note that semicolons work with incomplete vectors, but they
  work better in algebraic entry. That's why we use the apostrophe
  in the second example.</p>

  <p>When two matrices are multiplied, the lefthand matrix must
  have the same number of columns as the righthand matrix has rows.
  Row &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  column &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo; of
  the result is effectively the dot product of row
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; of the
  left matrix by column &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo; of the right matrix.</p>

  <p>If we try to duplicate this matrix and multiply it by itself,
  the dimensions are wrong and the multiplication cannot take
  place:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]   * [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]     [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]
         .

         &lt;RET&gt; *
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Though rather hard to read, this is a formula
  which shows the product of two matrices. The
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; function,
  having invalid arguments, has been left in symbolic form.</p>

  <p>We can multiply the matrices if we <dfn>transpose</dfn> one of
  them first.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]       1:  [ [ 14, 32 ]      1:  [ [ 17, 22, 27 ]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]           [ 32, 77 ] ]          [ 22, 29, 36 ]
     1:  [ [ 1, 4 ]              .                       [ 27, 36, 45 ] ]
           [ 2, 5 ]                                    .
           [ 3, 6 ] ]
         .

         U v t                   *                     U &lt;TAB&gt; *
</pre>

  <p>Matrix multiplication is not commutative; indeed, switching
  the order of the operands can even change the dimensions of the
  result matrix, as happened here!</p>

  <p>If you multiply a plain vector by a matrix, it is treated as a
  single row or column depending on which side of the matrix it is
  on. The result is a plain vector which should also be interpreted
  as a row or column as appropriate.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]      1:  [14, 32]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]        .
     1:  [1, 2, 3]
         .

         r 4 r 1                *
</pre>

  <p>Multiplying in the other order wouldn't work because the
  number of rows in the matrix is different from the number of
  elements in the vector.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Use
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to sum
  along the rows of the above <!-- @math{2\times3} -->
   2x3 matrix to get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[6,
  15]</span></samp>&rsquo;. Now use &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to sum along the columns to get
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[5, 7, 9]</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  See <a href="Matrix-Answer-1.html#Matrix-Answer-1">1</a>.

  <p><a name="index-Identity-matrix-38" id=
  "index-Identity-matrix-38"></a>An <dfn>identity matrix</dfn> is a
  square matrix with ones along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
  It has the property that multiplication by an identity matrix, on
  the left or on the right, always produces the original
  matrix.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]      2:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]      1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]          [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]          [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]
         .                  1:  [ [ 1, 0, 0 ]          .
                                  [ 0, 1, 0 ]
                                  [ 0, 0, 1 ] ]
                                .

</pre>

  <p>If a matrix is square, it is often possible to find its
  <dfn>inverse</dfn>, that is, a matrix which, when multiplied by
  the original matrix, yields an identity matrix. The
  <kbd>&amp;</kbd> (reciprocal) key also computes the inverse of a
  matrix.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]      1:  [ [   -2.4,     1.2,   -0.2 ]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ]            [    2.8,    -1.4,    0.4 ]
           [ 7, 6, 0 ] ]          [ -0.73333, 0.53333, -0.2 ] ]
         .                      .

         r 4 r 2 |  s 5         &amp;
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The vertical bar <kbd>|</kbd>
  <dfn>concatenates</dfn> numbers, vectors, and matrices together.
  Here we have used it to add a new row onto our matrix to make it
  square.</p>

  <p>We can multiply these two matrices in either order to get an
  identity.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  [ [ 1., 0., 0. ]      1:  [ [ 1., 0., 0. ]
           [ 0., 1., 0. ]            [ 0., 1., 0. ]
           [ 0., 0., 1. ] ]          [ 0., 0., 1. ] ]
         .                         .

         M-&lt;RET&gt;  *                  U &lt;TAB&gt; *
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-Systems-of-linear-equations-39" id=
  "index-Systems-of-linear-equations-39"></a><a name=
  "index-Linear-equations_002c-systems-of-40" id=
  "index-Linear-equations_002c-systems-of-40"></a>Matrix inverses
  are related to systems of linear equations in algebra. Suppose we
  had the following set of equations:</p>
  <pre class="example">
         a + 2b + 3c = 6
        4a + 5b + 6c = 2
        7a + 6b      = 3
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">This can be cast into the matrix
  equation,</p>
  <pre class="example">
        [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]     [ [ a ]     [ [ 6 ]
          [ 4, 5, 6 ]   *   [ b ]   =   [ 2 ]
          [ 7, 6, 0 ] ]     [ c ] ]     [ 3 ] ]
</pre>

  <p>We can solve this system of equations by multiplying both
  sides by the inverse of the matrix. Calc can do this all in one
  step:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  [6, 2, 3]          1:  [-12.6, 15.2, -3.93333]
     1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]          .
           [ 4, 5, 6 ]
           [ 7, 6, 0 ] ]
         .

         [6,2,3] r 5            /
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The result is the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[a, b, c]</span></samp>&rsquo; vector that solves the
  equations. (Dividing by a square matrix is equivalent to
  multiplying by its inverse.)</p>

  <p>Let's verify this solution:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     2:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]                1:  [6., 2., 3.]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ]                    .
           [ 7, 6, 0 ] ]
     1:  [-12.6, 15.2, -3.93333]
         .

         r 5  &lt;TAB&gt;                         *
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Note that we had to be careful about the
  order in which we multiplied the matrix and vector. If we
  multiplied in the other order, Calc would assume the vector was a
  row vector in order to make the dimensions come out right, and
  the answer would be incorrect. If you don't feel safe letting
  Calc take either interpretation of your vectors, use explicit
  <!-- @math{N\times1} -->
   Nx1 or <!-- @math{1\times N} -->
   1xN matrices instead. In this case, you would enter the original
  column vector as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[6], [2],
  [3]]</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[6;
  2; 3]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Algebraic entry allows
  you to make vectors and matrices that include variables. Solve
  the following system of equations to get expressions for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; in terms
  of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
  <pre class="example">
        x + a y = 6
        x + b y = 10
</pre>

  <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> A system of equations is
  &ldquo;over-determined&rdquo; if it has more equations than
  variables. It is often the case that there are no values for the
  variables that will satisfy all the equations at once, but it is
  still useful to find a set of values which &ldquo;nearly&rdquo;
  satisfy all the equations. In terms of matrix equations, you
  can't solve &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A X =
  B</span></samp>&rsquo; directly because the matrix
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo; is not
  square for an over-determined system. Matrix inversion works only
  for square matrices. One common trick is to multiply both sides
  on the left by the transpose of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;: &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">trn(A)*A*X = trn(A)*B</span></samp>&rsquo;. Now
  <!-- @math{A^T A} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">trn(A)*A</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  a square matrix so a solution is possible. It turns out that the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; vector you
  compute in this way will be a &ldquo;least-squares&rdquo;
  solution, which can be regarded as the &ldquo;closest&rdquo;
  solution to the set of equations. Use Calc to solve the following
  over-determined system:</p>
  <pre class="example">
         a + 2b + 3c = 6
        4a + 5b + 6c = 2
        7a + 6b      = 3
        2a + 4b + 6c = 11
