  <h4 class="subsection">11.11.5 Other Features of Rewrite
  Rules</h4>

  <p class="noindent">Certain &ldquo;function names&rdquo; serve as
  markers in rewrite rules. Here is a complete list of these
  markers. First are listed the markers that work inside a pattern;
  then come the markers that work in the righthand side of a
  rule.</p>

  <p><a name="index-import-1913" id="index-import-1913"></a>One
  kind of marker, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">import(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, takes the place of a whole
  rule. Here &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;
  is the name of a variable containing another rule set; those
  rules are &ldquo;spliced into&rdquo; the rule set that imports
  them. For example, if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[f(a+b) :=
  f(a) + f(b), f(a b) := a f(b) :: real(a)]</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  stored in variable &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">linearF</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the rule set
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[f(0) := 0,
  import(linearF)]</span></samp>&rsquo; will apply all three rules.
  It is possible to modify the imported rules slightly:
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">import(x, v1, x1, v2, x2,
  ...)</span></samp>&rsquo; imports the rule set
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; with all
  occurrences of <!-- @math{v_1}, -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">v1</span></samp>&rsquo;, as
  either a variable name or a function name, replaced with
  <!-- @math{x_1} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x1</span></samp>&rsquo; and so
  on. (If <!-- @math{v_1} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">v1</span></samp>&rsquo; is used
  as a function name, then <!-- @math{x_1} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x1</span></samp>&rsquo; must be
  either a function name itself or a &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">&lt;&nbsp;&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> nameless
  function; see <a href=
  "Specifying-Operators.html#Specifying-Operators">Specifying
  Operators</a>.) For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[g(0) := 0, import(linearF, f, g)]</span></samp>&rsquo;
  applies the linearity rules to the function
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo;. Imports
  can be nested, but the import-with-renaming feature may fail to
  rename sub-imports properly.</p>

  <p>The special functions allowed in patterns are:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">quote(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd><a name="index-quote-1914" id="index-quote-1914"></a>This
    pattern matches exactly &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;; variable names in
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; are not
    interpreted as meta-variables. The only flexibility is that
    numbers are compared for numeric equality, so that the pattern
    &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">f(quote(12))</span></samp>&rsquo; will match both
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(12)</span></samp>&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(12.0)</span></samp>&rsquo;.
    (Numbers are always treated this way by the rewrite mechanism:
    The rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x,x) :=
    g(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; will match &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">f(12, 12.0)</span></samp>&rsquo;. The rewrite may
    produce either &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">g(12)</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">g(12.0)</span></samp>&rsquo; as a result in this
    case.)<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">plain(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd><a name="index-plain-1915" id="index-plain-1915"></a>Here
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; must be
    a function call &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">f(x1,x2,...)</span></samp>&rsquo;. This pattern matches
    a call to function &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; with the specified argument
    patterns. No special knowledge of the properties of the
    function &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo;
    is used in this case; &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; is not commutative or
    associative. Unlike <code>quote</code>, the arguments
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x1,x2,...</span></samp>&rsquo;
    are treated as patterns. If you wish them to be treated
    &ldquo;plainly&rdquo; as well, you must enclose them with more
    <code>plain</code> markers: &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">plain(plain(-a<!-- /@w -->) + plain(b
    c))</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">opt(x,def)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-opt-1916" id="index-opt-1916"></a>Here
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; must
      be a variable name. This must appear as an argument to a
      function or an element of a vector; it specifies that the
      argument or element is optional. As an argument to
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">||</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
      as the second argument to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;, the value <var>def</var> may
      be omitted. The pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x +
      opt(y)</span></samp>&rsquo; matches a sum by binding one
      summand to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and the other to
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
      it matches anything else by binding the whole expression to
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and
      zero to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;. The other operators above work
      similarly.

      <p>For general miscellaneous functions, the default value
      <code>def</code> must be specified. Optional arguments are
      dropped starting with the rightmost one during matching. For
      example, the pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">f(opt(a,0), b, opt(c,b))</span></samp>&rsquo; will
      match &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">f(b)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">f(a,b)</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
      &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">f(a,b,c)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Default values of zero
      and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;
      are supplied in this example for the omitted arguments. Note
      that the literal variable &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; will be the default in the
      latter case, <em>not</em> the value that matched the
      meta-variable &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;. In other words, the default
      <var>def</var> is effectively quoted.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">condition(x,c)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd><a name="index-condition-1917" id=

    id="index-g_t_003a_003a-1918"></a>This matches the pattern
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, with
    the attached condition &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;. It is the same as
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x ::
    c</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=

    matches both pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class=

    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;. It is

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=

    <!-- /@w -->.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=

    <dd><a name="index-pnot-1923" id="index-pnot-1923"></a><a name=
    "index-g_t_0021_0021_0021-1924" id=
    "index-g_t_0021_0021_0021-1924"></a>This matches anything that
    does not match pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. It is the same as
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!!
    x</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">cons(h,t)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd><a name="index-cons-_0028rewrites_0029-1925" id=
    "index-cons-_0028rewrites_0029-1925"></a>This matches any
    vector of one or more elements. The first element is matched to
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo;; a
    vector of the remaining elements is matched to
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;. Note
    that vectors of fixed length can also be matched as actual
    vectors: The rule &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">cons(a,cons(b,[])) := cons(a+b,[])</span></samp>&rsquo;
    is equivalent to the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a,b]
    := [a+b]</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">rcons(t,h)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd><a name="index-rcons-_0028rewrites_0029-1926" id=
    "index-rcons-_0028rewrites_0029-1926"></a>This is like
    <code>cons</code>, except that the <em>last</em> element is
    matched to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo;, with the remaining elements
    matched to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">apply(f,args)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-apply-_0028rewrites_0029-1927" id=
      "index-apply-_0028rewrites_0029-1927"></a>This matches any
      function call. The name of the function, in the form of a
      variable, is matched to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo;. The arguments of the function,
      as a vector of zero or more objects, are matched to
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">args</span></samp>&rsquo;.
      Constants, variables, and vectors do <em>not</em> match an
      <code>apply</code> pattern. For example,
      &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">apply(f,x)</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any function
      call, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">apply(quote(f),x)</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any
      call to the function &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">apply(f,[a,b])</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any
      function call with exactly two arguments, and
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">apply(quote(f),
      cons(a,cons(b,x)))</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any call to
      the function &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; with two or more arguments.
      Another way to implement the latter, if the rest of the rule
      does not need to refer to the first two arguments of
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; by
      name, would be &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">apply(quote(f), x :: vlen(x) &gt;=
      2)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Here's a more interesting sample use
      of <code>apply</code>:
      <pre class="example">
          apply(f,[x+n])  :=  n + apply(f,[x])
             :: in(f, [floor,ceil,round,trunc]) :: integer(n)
</pre>

      <p>Note, however, that this will be slower to match than a
      rule set with four separate rules. The reason is that Calc
      sorts the rules of a rule set according to top-level function
      name; if the top-level function is <code>apply</code>, Calc
      must try the rule for every single formula and sub-formula.
      If the top-level function in the pattern is, say,
      <code>floor</code>, then Calc invokes the rule only for
      sub-formulas which are calls to <code>floor</code>.</p>

      <p>Formulas normally written with operators like
      <code>+</code> are still considered function calls:
      <code>apply(f,x)</code> matches &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">a+b</span></samp>&rsquo; with
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f = add</span></samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x =
      [a,b]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

      <p>You must use <code>apply</code> for meta-variables with
      function names on both sides of a rewrite rule:
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">apply(f, [x]) :=
      f(x+1)</span></samp>&rsquo; is <em>not</em> correct, because
      it rewrites &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">spam(6)</span></samp>&rsquo; into
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(7)</span></samp>&rsquo;.
      The righthand side should be &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">apply(f, [x+1])</span></samp>&rsquo;. Also note that
      you will have to use No-Simplify mode (<kbd>m O</kbd>) when
      entering this rule so that the <code>apply</code> isn't
      evaluated immediately to get the new rule
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x) :=
      f(x+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Or, use <kbd>s e</kbd> to enter
      the rule without going through the stack, or enter the rule
      as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">apply(f, [x]) := apply(f,
      [x+1]) ::&nbsp;1<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;. See
      <a href=
      "Conditional-Rewrite-Rules.html#Conditional-Rewrite-Rules">Conditional
      Rewrite Rules</a>.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">select(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd><a name="index-select-1928" id="index-select-1928"></a>This
    is used for applying rules to formulas with selections; see
    <a href=
    "Selections-with-Rewrite-Rules.html#Selections-with-Rewrite-Rules">
    Selections with Rewrite Rules</a>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Special functions for the righthand sides of rules are:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">quote(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>The notation &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">quote(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is changed to
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; when the
    righthand side is used. As far as the rewrite rule is
    concerned, <code>quote</code> is invisible. However,
    <code>quote</code> has the special property in Calc that its
    argument is not evaluated. Thus, while it will not work to put
    the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t(a) :=
    typeof(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack because
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">typeof(a)</span></samp>&rsquo;
    is evaluated immediately to produce &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">t(a) := 100</span></samp>&rsquo;, you can use
    <code>quote</code> to protect the righthand side:
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t(a) :=
    quote(typeof(a))</span></samp>&rsquo;. (See <a href=
    "Conditional-Rewrite-Rules.html#Conditional-Rewrite-Rules">Conditional
    Rewrite Rules</a>, for another trick for protecting rules from
    evaluation.)<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">plain(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>Special properties of and simplifications for the function
    call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; are
    not used. One interesting case where <code>plain</code> is
    useful is the rule, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q(x) :=
    quote(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, trying to expand a shorthand
    notation for the <code>quote</code> function. This rule will
    not work as shown; instead of replacing
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q(foo)</span></samp>&rsquo;
    with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">quote(foo)</span></samp>&rsquo;, it will replace it with
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;! The
    correct rule would be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q(x) :=
    plain(quote(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">cons(h,t)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>Where &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo; is a vector, this is converted
    into an expanded vector during rewrite processing. Note that
    <code>cons</code> is a regular Calc function which normally
    does this anyway; the only way <code>cons</code> is treated
    specially by rewrites is that <code>cons</code> on the
    righthand side of a rule will be evaluated even if default
    simplifications have been turned off.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">rcons(t,h)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>Analogous to <code>cons</code> except putting
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo; at the
    <em>end</em> of the vector &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=

  <p>There are also some special functions you can use in
  conditions.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">let(v :=
    x)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-let-1932" id="index-let-1932"></a>The
      expression &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is evaluated with
      meta-variables substituted. The <kbd>a s</kbd> command's
      simplifications are <em>not</em> applied by default, but
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; can
      include calls to <code>evalsimp</code> or
      <code>evalextsimp</code> as described above to invoke higher
      levels of simplification. The result of
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is
      then bound to the meta-variable &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">v</span></samp>&rsquo;. As usual, if this
      meta-variable has already been matched to something else the
      two values must be equal; if the meta-variable is new then it
      is bound to the result of the expression. This variable can
      then appear in later conditions, and on the righthand side of
      the rule. In fact, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">v</span></samp>&rsquo; may be any pattern in which
      case the result of evaluating &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is matched to that pattern,
      binding any meta-variables that appear in that pattern. Note
      that <code>let</code> can only appear by itself as a
      condition, or as one term of an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; which is a whole
      condition: It cannot be inside an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">||</span></samp>&rsquo; term or otherwise buried.

      <p>The alternate, equivalent form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">let(v, x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is also recognized.
      Note that the use of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; by <code>let</code>, while
      still being assignment-like in character, is unrelated to the
      use of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; in the main part of a rewrite
      rule.</p>

      <p>As an example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(a) :=
      g(ia) :: let(ia := 1/a) :: constant(ia)</span></samp>&rsquo;
      replaces &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">f(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; with
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo; of the
      inverse of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;, if that inverse exists and is
      constant. For example, if &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; is a singular matrix the
      operation &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">1/a</span></samp>&rsquo; is left unsimplified and
      &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">constant(ia)</span></samp>&rsquo; fails, but if
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; is an
      invertible matrix then the rule succeeds. Without
      <code>let</code> there would be no way to express this rule
      that didn't have to invert the matrix twice. Note that,
      because the meta-variable &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">ia</span></samp>&rsquo; is otherwise unbound in this
      rule, the <code>let</code> condition itself always
      &ldquo;succeeds&rdquo; because no matter what
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/a</span></samp>&rsquo;
      evaluates to, it can successfully be bound to
      <code>ia</code>.</p>

      <p>Here's another example, for integrating cosines of linear
      terms: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myint(cos(y),x) :=
      sin(y)/b :: let([a,b,x] := lin(y,x))</span></samp>&rsquo;.
      The <code>lin</code> function returns a 3-vector if its
      argument is linear, or leaves itself unevaluated if not. But
      an unevaluated <code>lin</code> call will not match the
      3-vector on the lefthand side of the <code>let</code>, so
      this <code>let</code> both verifies that <code>y</code> is
      linear, and binds the coefficients <code>a</code> and
      <code>b</code> for use elsewhere in the rule. (It would have
      been possible to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(a x
      + b)/b</span></samp>&rsquo; for the righthand side instead,
      but using &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">sin(y)/b</span></samp>&rsquo; avoids gratuitous
      rearrangement of the argument of the sine.)</p>

      <p><a name="index-ierf-1933" id=
      "index-ierf-1933"></a>Similarly, here is a rule that
      implements an inverse-<code>erf</code> function. It uses
      <code>root</code> to search for a solution. If
      <code>root</code> succeeds, it will return a vector of two
      numbers where the first number is the desired solution. If no
      solution is found, <code>root</code> remains in symbolic
      form. So we use <code>let</code> to check that the result was
      indeed a vector.</p>
      <pre class="example">
          ierf(x)  :=  y  :: let([y,z] := root(erf(a) = x, a, .5))
</pre><br />
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">matches(v,p)</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      The meta-variable <var>v</var>, which must already have been
      matched to something elsewhere in the rule, is compared
      against pattern <var>p</var>. Since <code>matches</code> is a
      standard Calc function, it can appear anywhere in a
      condition. But if it appears alone or as a term of a
      top-level &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, then you get the
      special extra feature that meta-variables which are bound to
      things inside <var>p</var> can be used elsewhere in the
      surrounding rewrite rule.

      <p>The only real difference between &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">let(p := v)</span></samp>&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">matches(v,
      p)</span></samp>&rsquo; is that the former evaluates
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">v</span></samp>&rsquo; using
      the default simplifications, while the latter does
      not.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">remember</span></samp>&rsquo;</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-remember-1934" id=
      "index-remember-1934"></a>This is actually a variable, not a
      function. If <code>remember</code> appears as a condition in
      a rule, then when that rule succeeds the original expression
      and rewritten expression are added to the front of the rule
      set that contained the rule. If the rule set was not stored
      in a variable, <code>remember</code> is ignored. The lefthand
      side is enclosed in <code>quote</code> in the added rule if
      it contains any variables.

      <p>For example, the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(n)
      := n f(n-1) :: remember</span></samp>&rsquo; applied to
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(7)</span></samp>&rsquo;
      will add the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(7) := 7
      f(6)</span></samp>&rsquo; to the front of the rule set. The
      rule set <code>EvalRules</code> works slightly differently:
      There, the evaluation of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">f(6)</span></samp>&rsquo; will complete before the
      result is added to the rule set, in this case as
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(7) :=
      5040</span></samp>&rsquo;. Thus <code>remember</code> is most
      useful inside <code>EvalRules</code>.</p>

      <p>It is up to you to ensure that the optimization performed
      by <code>remember</code> is safe. For example, the rule
      &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo(n) := n :: evalv(eatfoo)
      &gt; 0 :: remember</span></samp>&rsquo; is a bad idea
      (<code>evalv</code> is the function equivalent of the
      <kbd>=</kbd> command); if the variable <code>eatfoo</code>
      ever contains 1, rules like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">foo(7) := 7</span></samp>&rsquo; will be added to the
      rule set and will continue to operate even if
      <code>eatfoo</code> is later changed to 0.<br /></p>
