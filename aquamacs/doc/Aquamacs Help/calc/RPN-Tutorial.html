  <h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 RPN Calculations and the Stack</h4>

  <p><a name="index-RPN-notation-7" id=
  "index-RPN-notation-7"></a>Calc normally uses RPN notation. You
  may be familiar with the RPN system from Hewlett-Packard
  calculators, FORTH, or PostScript. (Reverse Polish Notation, RPN,
  is named after the Polish mathematician Jan Lukasiewicz.)</p>

  <p>The central component of an RPN calculator is the
  <dfn>stack</dfn>. A calculator stack is like a stack of dishes.
  New dishes (numbers) are added at the top of the stack, and
  numbers are normally only removed from the top of the stack.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Operators-8" id=
  "index-Operators-8"></a><a name="index-Operands-9" id=
  "index-Operands-9"></a>In an operation like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2+3</span></samp>&rsquo;, the 2
  and 3 are called the <dfn>operands</dfn> and the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; is the
  <dfn>operator</dfn>. In an RPN calculator you always enter the
  operands first, then the operator. Each time you type a number,
  Calc adds or <dfn>pushes</dfn> it onto the top of the Stack. When
  you press an operator key like <kbd>+</kbd>, Calc <dfn>pops</dfn>
  the appropriate number of operands from the stack and pushes back
  the result.</p>

  <p>Thus we could add the numbers 2 and 3 in an RPN calculator by
  typing: <kbd>2 &lt;RET&gt; 3 &lt;RET&gt; +</kbd>. (The
  &lt;RET&gt; key, Return, corresponds to the &lt;ENTER&gt; key on
  traditional RPN calculators.) Try this now if you wish; type
  <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> to switch into the Calc window (you can type
  <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> again or <kbd>C-x * o</kbd> to switch back to
  the Tutorial window). The first four keystrokes
  &ldquo;push&rdquo; the numbers 2 and 3 onto the stack. The
  <kbd>+</kbd> key &ldquo;pops&rdquo; the top two numbers from the
  stack, adds them, and pushes the result (5) back onto the stack.
  Here's how the stack will look at various points throughout the
  calculation:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
         .          1:  2          2:  2          1:  5              .
                        .          1:  3              .
                                       .

       C-x * c          2 &lt;RET&gt;          3 &lt;RET&gt;            +             &lt;DEL&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;
  symbol is a marker that represents the top of the stack. Note
  that the &ldquo;top&rdquo; of the stack is really shown at the
  bottom of the Stack window. This may seem backwards, but it turns
  out to be less distracting in regular use.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Stack-levels-10" id=
  "index-Stack-levels-10"></a><a name="index-Levels-of-stack-11"
  id="index-Levels-of-stack-11"></a>The numbers
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1:</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2:</span></samp>&rsquo; on the
  left are <dfn>stack level numbers</dfn>. Old RPN calculators
  always had four stack levels called &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;. Calc's stack can grow as large as
  you like, so it uses numbers instead of letters. Some
  stack-manipulation commands accept a numeric argument that says
  which stack level to work on. Normal commands like <kbd>+</kbd>
  always work on the top few levels of the stack.
  <!-- [fix-ref Truncating the Stack] --></p>

  <p>The Stack buffer is just an Emacs buffer, and you can move
  around in it using the regular Emacs motion commands. But no
  matter where the cursor is, even if you have scrolled the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; marker out
  of view, most Calc commands always move the cursor back down to
  level 1 before doing anything. It is possible to move the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; marker
  upwards through the stack, temporarily &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; some
  numbers from commands like <kbd>+</kbd>. This is called
  <dfn>stack truncation</dfn> and we will not cover it in this
  tutorial; see <a href=
  "Truncating-the-Stack.html#Truncating-the-Stack">Truncating the
  Stack</a>, if you are interested.</p>

  <p>You don't really need the second &lt;RET&gt; in <kbd>2
  &lt;RET&gt; 3 &lt;RET&gt; +</kbd>. That's because if you type any
  operator name or other non-numeric key when you are entering a
  number, the Calculator automatically enters that number and then
  does the requested command. Thus <kbd>2 &lt;RET&gt; 3 +</kbd>
  will work just as well.</p>

  <p>Examples in this tutorial will often omit &lt;RET&gt; even
  when the stack displays shown would only happen if you did press
  &lt;RET&gt;:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  2          2:  2          1:  5
         .          1:  3              .
                        .

       2 &lt;RET&gt;            3              +
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Here, after pressing <kbd>3</kbd> the stack
  would really show &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1:
  2</span></samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Calc:
  3</span></samp>&rsquo; in the minibuffer. In these situations,
  you can press the optional &lt;RET&gt; to see the stack as the
  figure shows.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> (This tutorial will
  include exercises at various points. Try them if you wish.
  Answers to all the exercises are located at the end of the
  Tutorial chapter. Each exercise will include a cross-reference to
  its particular answer. If you are reading with the Emacs Info
  system, press <kbd>f</kbd> and the exercise number to go to the
  answer, then the letter <kbd>l</kbd> to return to where you
  were.)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Here's the first exercise: What will the
  keystrokes <kbd>1 &lt;RET&gt; 2 &lt;RET&gt; 3 &lt;RET&gt; 4 + *
  -</kbd> compute? (&lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; is the symbol for multiplication.)
  Figure it out by hand, then try it with Calc to see if you're
  right. See <a href="RPN-Answer-1.html#RPN-Answer-1">1</a>.
  (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Compute
  <!-- @math{(2\times4) + (7\times9.4) + {5\over4}} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2*4 + 7*9.5 +
  5/4</span></samp>&rsquo; using the stack. See <a href=
  "RPN-Answer-2.html#RPN-Answer-2">2</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>The &lt;DEL&gt; key is called Backspace on some keyboards. It
  is whatever key you would use to correct a simple typing error
  when regularly using Emacs. The &lt;DEL&gt; key pops and throws
  away the top value on the stack. (You can still get that value
  back from the Trail if you should need it later on.) There are
  many places in this tutorial where we assume you have used
  &lt;DEL&gt; to erase the results of the previous example at the
  beginning of a new example. In the few places where it is really
  important to use &lt;DEL&gt; to clear away old results, the text
  will remind you to do so.</p>

  <p>(It won't hurt to let things accumulate on the stack, except
  that whenever you give a display-mode-changing command Calc will
  have to spend a long time reformatting such a large stack.)</p>

  <p>Since the <kbd>-</kbd> key is also an operator (it subtracts
  the top two stack elements), how does one enter a negative
  number? Calc uses the <kbd>_</kbd> (underscore) key to act like
  the minus sign in a number. So, typing <kbd>-5 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
  won't work because the <kbd>-</kbd> key will try to do a
  subtraction, but <kbd>_5 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> works just fine.</p>

  <p>You can also press <kbd>n</kbd>, which means &ldquo;change
  sign.&rdquo; It changes the number at the top of the stack (or
  the number being entered) from positive to negative or
  vice-versa: <kbd>5 n &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Duplicating-a-stack-entry-12" id=
  "index-Duplicating-a-stack-entry-12"></a>If you press &lt;RET&gt;
  when you're not entering a number, the effect is to duplicate the
  top number on the stack. Consider this calculation:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  3          2:  3          1:  9          2:  9          1:  81
         .          1:  3              .          1:  9              .
                        .                             .

       3 &lt;RET&gt;           &lt;RET&gt;             *             &lt;RET&gt;             *
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(Of course, an easier way to do this would be
  <kbd>3 &lt;RET&gt; 4 ^</kbd>, to raise 3 to the fourth
  power.)</p>

  <p>The space-bar key (denoted &lt;SPC&gt; here) performs the same
  function as &lt;RET&gt;; you could replace all three occurrences
  of &lt;RET&gt; in the above example with &lt;SPC&gt; and the
  effect would be the same.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Exchanging-stack-entries-13" id=
  "index-Exchanging-stack-entries-13"></a>Another stack
  manipulation key is &lt;TAB&gt;. This exchanges the top two stack
  entries. Suppose you have computed <kbd>2 &lt;RET&gt; 3 +</kbd>
  to get 5, and then you realize what you really wanted to compute
  was &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">20 /
  (2+3)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  5          2:  5          2:  20         1:  4
         .          1:  20         1:  5              .
                        .              .

      2 &lt;RET&gt; 3 +         20            &lt;TAB&gt;             /
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Planning ahead, the calculation would have
  gone like this:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  20         2:  20         3:  20         2:  20         1:  4
         .          1:  2          2:  2          1:  5              .
                        .          1:  3              .
                                       .

       20 &lt;RET&gt;         2 &lt;RET&gt;            3              +              /
</pre>

  <p>A related stack command is <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (hold
  &lt;META&gt; and type &lt;TAB&gt;). It rotates the top three
  elements of the stack upward, bringing the object in level 3 to
  the top.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  10         2:  10         3:  10         3:  20         3:  30
         .          1:  20         2:  20         2:  30         2:  10
                        .          1:  30         1:  10         1:  20
                                       .              .              .

       10 &lt;RET&gt;         20 &lt;RET&gt;         30 &lt;RET&gt;         M-&lt;TAB&gt;          M-&lt;TAB&gt;
</pre>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Suppose the numbers 10,
  20, and 30 are on the stack. Figure out how to add one to the
  number in level 2 without affecting the rest of the stack. Also
  figure out how to add one to the number in level 3. See <a href=
  "RPN-Answer-3.html#RPN-Answer-3">3</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>Operations like <kbd>+</kbd>, <kbd>-</kbd>, <kbd>*</kbd>,
  <kbd>/</kbd>, and <kbd>^</kbd> pop two arguments from the stack
  and push a result. Operations like <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>Q</kbd>
  (square root) pop a single number and push the result. You can
  think of them as simply operating on the top element of the
  stack.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  3          1:  9          2:  9          1:  25         1:  5
         .              .          1:  16             .              .
                                       .

       3 &lt;RET&gt;          &lt;RET&gt; *        4 &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt; *        +              Q
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(Note that capital <kbd>Q</kbd> means to hold
  down the Shift key while typing <kbd>q</kbd>. Remember, plain
  unshifted <kbd>q</kbd> is the Quit command.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-Pythagorean-Theorem-14" id=
  "index-Pythagorean-Theorem-14"></a>Here we've used the
  Pythagorean Theorem to determine the hypotenuse of a right
  triangle. Calc actually has a built-in command for that called
  <kbd>f h</kbd>, but let's suppose we can't remember the necessary
  keystrokes. We can still enter it by its full name using
  <kbd>M-x</kbd> notation:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  3          2:  3          1:  5
         .          1:  4              .
                        .

       3 &lt;RET&gt;          4 &lt;RET&gt;      M-x calc-hypot
</pre>

  <p>All Calculator commands begin with the word
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">calc-</span></samp>&rsquo;. Since
  it gets tiring to type this, Calc provides an <kbd>x</kbd> key
  which is just like the regular Emacs <kbd>M-x</kbd> key except
  that it types the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">calc-</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix for you:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  3          2:  3          1:  5
         .          1:  4              .
                        .

       3 &lt;RET&gt;          4 &lt;RET&gt;         x hypot
</pre>

  <p>What happens if you take the square root of a negative
  number?</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  4          1:  -4         1:  (0, 2)
         .              .              .

       4 &lt;RET&gt;            n              Q
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The notation &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(a, b)</span></samp>&rsquo; represents a complex number.
  Complex numbers are more traditionally written
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b i</span></samp>&rsquo;;
  Calc can display in this format, too, but for now we'll stick to
  the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a, b)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  notation.</p>

  <p>If you don't know how complex numbers work, you can safely
  ignore this feature. Complex numbers only arise from operations
  that would be errors in a calculator that didn't have complex
  numbers. (For example, taking the square root or logarithm of a
  negative number produces a complex result.)</p>

  <p>Complex numbers are entered in the notation shown. The
  <kbd>(</kbd> and <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd>)</kbd> keys manipulate
  &ldquo;incomplete complex numbers.&rdquo;</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  ( ...      2:  ( ...      1:  (2, ...    1:  (2, ...    1:  (2, 3)
         .          1:  2              .              3              .
                        .                             .

         (              2              ,              3              )
</pre>

  <p>You can perform calculations while entering parts of
  incomplete objects. However, an incomplete object cannot actually
  participate in a calculation:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  ( ...      2:  ( ...      3:  ( ...      1:  ( ...      1:  ( ...
         .          1:  2          2:  2              5              5
                        .          1:  3              .              .
                                       .
                                                                  (error)
         (             2 &lt;RET&gt;           3              +              +
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Adding 5 to an incomplete object makes no
  sense, so the last command produces an error message and leaves
  the stack the same.</p>

  <p>Incomplete objects can't participate in arithmetic, but they
  can be moved around by the regular stack commands.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Note that the <kbd>,</kbd> (comma) key did
  not have to be used here. When you press <kbd>)</kbd> all the
  stack entries between the incomplete entry and the top are
  collected, so there's never really a reason to use the comma.
  It's up to you.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 4.</strong> To enter the complex
  number &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(2,
  3)</span></samp>&rsquo;, your friend Joe typed <kbd>( 2 ,
  &lt;SPC&gt; 3 )</kbd>. What happened? (Joe thought of a clever
  way to correct his mistake in only two keystrokes, but it didn't
  quite work. Try it to find out why.) See <a href=
  "RPN-Answer-4.html#RPN-Answer-4">4</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>Vectors are entered the same way as complex numbers, but with
  square brackets in place of parentheses. We'll meet vectors again
  later in the tutorial.</p>

  <p>Any Emacs command can be given a <dfn>numeric prefix
  argument</dfn> by typing a series of &lt;META&gt;-digits
  beforehand. If &lt;META&gt; is awkward for you, you can instead
  type <kbd>C-u</kbd> followed by the necessary digits. Numeric
  prefix arguments can be negative, as in <kbd>M-- M-3 M-5</kbd> or
  <kbd>C-u&nbsp;-&nbsp;3&nbsp;5</kbd><!-- /@w -->. Calc commands
  use numeric prefix arguments in a variety of ways. For example, a
  numeric prefix on the <kbd>+</kbd> operator adds any number of
  stack entries at once:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     1:  10         2:  10         3:  10         3:  10         1:  60
         .          1:  20         2:  20         2:  20             .
                        .          1:  30         1:  30
                                       .              .

       10 &lt;RET&gt;         20 &lt;RET&gt;         30 &lt;RET&gt;         C-u 3            +
</pre>

  <p>For stack manipulation commands like &lt;RET&gt;, a positive
  numeric prefix argument operates on the top <var>n</var> stack
  entries at once. A negative argument operates on the entry in
  level <var>n</var> only. An argument of zero operates on the
  entire stack. In this example, we copy the second-to-top element
  of the stack:</p>

         .          1:  20         2:  20         2:  20         3:  20

                                                                     .

       10 &lt;RET&gt;         20 &lt;RET&gt;         30 &lt;RET&gt;         C-u -2          &lt;RET&gt;
