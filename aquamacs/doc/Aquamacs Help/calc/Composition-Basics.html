  <h5 class="subsubsection">7.8.10.1 Composition Basics</h5>

  <p class="noindent">Compositions are generally formed by stacking
  formulas together horizontally or vertically in various ways.
  Those formulas are themselves compositions. TeX users will find
  this analogous to TeX's &ldquo;boxes.&rdquo; Each multi-line
  composition has a <dfn>baseline</dfn>; horizontal compositions
  use the baselines to decide how formulas should be positioned
  relative to one another. For example, in the Big mode formula</p>
  <pre class="example">
               2
          a + b
     17 + ------
            c
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">the second term of the sum is four lines tall
  and has line three as its baseline. Thus when the term is
  combined with 17, line three is placed on the same level as the
  baseline of 17.</p>

  <p>Another important composition concept is
  <dfn>precedence</dfn>. This is an integer that represents the
  binding strength of various operators. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; has higher
  precedence (195) than &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; (180), which means that
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a * b) + c</span></samp>&rsquo;
  will be formatted without the parentheses, but
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a * (b + c)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  will keep the parentheses.</p>

  <p>The operator table used by normal and Big language modes has
  the following precedences:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     _     1200    <span class="roman">(subscripts)</span>
     %     1100    <span class="roman">(as in n</span>%<span class=
"roman">)</span>
     !     1000    <span class="roman">(as in </span>!<span class=
"roman">n)</span>
     mod    400
     +/-    300
     !!     210    <span class=
"roman">(as in n</span>!!<span class="roman">)</span>
     !      210    <span class="roman">(as in n</span>!<span class=
"roman">)</span>
     ^      200
     -      197    <span class="roman">(as in </span>-<span class=
"roman">n)</span>
     *      195    <span class=
"roman">(or implicit multiplication)</span>
     / % \  190
     + -    180    <span class="roman">(as in a</span>+<span class=
"roman">b)</span>
     |      170
     &lt; =    160    <span class=
"roman">(and other relations)</span>
     &amp;&amp;     110
     ||     100
     ? :     90
     !!!     85
     &amp;&amp;&amp;     80
     |||     75
     :=      50
     ::      45
     =&gt;      40
</pre>

  <p>The general rule is that if an operator with precedence
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; occurs as
  an argument to an operator with precedence
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the
  argument is enclosed in parentheses if &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n &lt; m</span></samp>&rsquo;. Top-level expressions and
  expressions which are function arguments, vector components,
  etc., are formatted with precedence zero (so that they normally
  never get additional parentheses).</p>

  <p>For binary left-associative operators like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, the
  righthand argument is actually formatted with one-higher
  precedence than shown in the table. This makes sure
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a + b) + c</span></samp>&rsquo;
  omits the parentheses, but the unnatural form
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + (b + c)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  keeps its parentheses. Right-associative operators like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; format the
  lefthand argument with one-higher precedence.</p>

  <p><a name="index-cprec-616" id="index-cprec-616"></a>The
  <code>cprec</code> function formats an expression with an
  arbitrary precedence. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">cprec(abc, 185)</span></samp>&rsquo; will combine into
  sums and products as follows: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">7 +
  abc</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">7
  (abc)</span></samp>&rsquo; (because this <code>cprec</code> form
  has higher precedence than addition, but lower precedence than
  multiplication).</p>

  <p>A final composition issue is <dfn>line breaking</dfn>. Calc
  uses two different strategies for &ldquo;flat&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;non-flat&rdquo; compositions. A non-flat composition is
  anything that appears on multiple lines (not counting line
  breaking). Examples would be matrices and Big mode powers and
  quotients. Non-flat compositions are displayed exactly as
  specified. If they come out wider than the current window, you
  must use horizontal scrolling (<kbd>&lt;</kbd> and
  <kbd>&gt;</kbd>) to view them.</p>

  <p>Flat compositions, on the other hand, will be broken across
  several lines if they are too wide to fit the window. Certain
  points in a composition are noted internally as <dfn>break
  points</dfn>. Calc's general strategy is to fill each line as
  much as possible, then to move down to the next line starting at
  the first break point that didn't fit. However, the line breaker
  understands the hierarchical structure of formulas. It will not
  break an &ldquo;inner&rdquo; formula if it can use an earlier
  break point from an &ldquo;outer&rdquo; formula instead. For
  example, a vector of sums might be formatted as:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     [ a + b + c, d + e + f,
       g + h + i, j + k + l, m ]
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">If the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; can fit, then so, it seems, could
  the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo;. But
  Calc prefers to break at the comma since the comma is part of a
  &ldquo;more outer&rdquo; formula. Calc would break at a plus sign
  only if it had to, say, if the very first sum in the vector had
  itself been too large to fit.</p>

  <p>Of the composition functions described below, only
  <code>choriz</code> generates break points. The
  <code>bstring</code> function (see <a href=
  "Strings.html#Strings">Strings</a>) also generates breakable
  items: A break point is added after every space (or group of
  spaces) except for spaces at the very beginning or end of the
  string.</p>

  <p>Composition functions themselves count as levels in the
  formula hierarchy, so a <code>choriz</code> that is a component
  of a larger <code>choriz</code> will be less likely to be broken.
  As a special case, if a <code>bstring</code> occurs as a
  component of a <code>choriz</code> or <code>choriz</code>-like
  object (such as a vector or a list of arguments in a function
  call), then the break points in that <code>bstring</code> will be
  on the same level as the break points of the surrounding
  object.</p>
