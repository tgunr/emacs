  <p>The problem is not that the square operation is inexact, but
  that the sine of 45 that was already on the stack was accurate to
  only 12 places. Arbitrary-precision calculations still only give
  answers as good as their inputs.</p>

  <p>The real problem is that there is no 12-digit number which,
  when squared, comes out to 0.5 exactly. The <kbd>f [</kbd> and
  <kbd>f ]</kbd> commands decrease or increase a number by one unit
  in the last place (according to the current precision). They are
  useful for determining facts like this.</p>

  <p>A high-precision calculation must be carried out in high
  precision all the way. The only number in the original problem
  which was known exactly was the quantity 45 degrees, so the
  precision must be raised before anything is done after the number
  45 has been entered in order for the higher precision to be
  meaningful.</p>
