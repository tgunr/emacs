  <h3 class="section">17.3 Assignments in Embedded Mode</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; (assignment) and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (&ldquo;evaluates-to&rdquo;) operators are especially useful in
  Embedded mode. They allow you to make a definition in one
  formula, then refer to that definition in other formulas embedded
  in the same buffer.</p>

  <p>An embedded formula which is an assignment to a variable, as
  in</p>
  <pre class="example">
     foo := 5
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">records &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">5</span></samp>&rsquo; as the stored value of
  <code>foo</code> for the purposes of Embedded mode operations in
  the current buffer. It does <em>not</em> actually store
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5</span></samp>&rsquo; as the
  &ldquo;global&rdquo; value of <code>foo</code>, however. Regular
  Calc operations, and Embedded formulas in other buffers, will not
  see this assignment.</p>

  <p>One way to use this assigned value is simply to create an
  Embedded formula elsewhere that refers to <code>foo</code>, and
  to press <kbd>=</kbd> in that formula. However, this permanently
  replaces the <code>foo</code> in the formula with its current
  value. More interesting is to use &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; elsewhere:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     foo + 7 =&gt; 12
</pre>

  <p>See <a href=
  "Evaluates_002dTo-Operator.html#Evaluates_002dTo-Operator">Evaluates-To
  Operator</a>, for a general discussion of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If you move back and change the assignment to
  <code>foo</code>, any &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; formulas which refer to it are
  automatically updated.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     foo := 17

     foo + 7 =&gt; 24
</pre>

  <p>The obvious question then is, <em>how</em> can one easily
  change the assignment to <code>foo</code>? If you simply select
  the formula in Embedded mode and type 17, the assignment itself
  will be replaced by the 17. The effect on the other formula will
  be that the variable <code>foo</code> becomes unassigned:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     17

     foo + 7 =&gt; foo + 7
</pre>

  <p>The right thing to do is first to use a selection command
  (<kbd>j 2</kbd> will do the trick) to select the righthand side
  of the assignment. Then, <kbd>17 &lt;TAB&gt; &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>
  will swap the 17 into place (see <a href=
  "Selecting-Subformulas.html#Selecting-Subformulas">Selecting
  Subformulas</a>, to see how this works).</p>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-j-2239" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-j-2239"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dselect-2240" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dselect-2240"></a>The <kbd>C-x *
  j</kbd> (<code>calc-embedded-select</code>) command provides an
  easy way to operate on assignments. It is just like <kbd>C-x *
  e</kbd>, except that if the enabled formula is an assignment, it
  uses <kbd>j 2</kbd> to select the righthand side. If the enabled
  formula is an evaluates-to, it uses <kbd>j 1</kbd> to select the
  lefthand side. A formula can also be a combination of both:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     bar := foo + 3 =&gt; 20
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">in which case <kbd>C-x * j</kbd> will select
  the middle part (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo +
  3</span></samp>&rsquo;).</p>

  <p>The formula is automatically deselected when you leave
  Embedded mode.</p>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-u-2241" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-u-2241"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dupdate_002dformula-2242" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dupdate_002dformula-2242"></a>Another
  way to change the assignment to <code>foo</code> would simply be
  to edit the number using regular Emacs editing rather than
  Embedded mode. Then, we have to find a way to get Embedded mode
  to notice the change. The <kbd>C-x * u</kbd>
  (<code>calc-embedded-update-formula</code>) command is a
  convenient way to do this.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     foo := 6

     foo + 7 =&gt; 13
</pre>

  <p>Pressing <kbd>C-x * u</kbd> is much like pressing <kbd>C-x * e
  = C-x * e</kbd>, that is, temporarily enabling Embedded mode for
  the formula under the cursor and then evaluating it with
  <kbd>=</kbd>. But <kbd>C-x * u</kbd> does not actually use
  <kbd>C-x * e</kbd>, and in fact another formula somewhere else
  can be enabled in Embedded mode while you use <kbd>C-x * u</kbd>
  and that formula will not be disturbed.</p>

  <p>With a numeric prefix argument, <kbd>C-x * u</kbd> updates all
  active &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  formulas in the buffer. Formulas which have not yet been
  activated in Embedded mode, and formulas which do not have
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; as
  their top-level operator, are not affected by this. (This is
  useful only if you have used <kbd>m C</kbd>; see below.)</p>

  <p>With a plain <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix, <kbd>C-u C-x * u</kbd>
  updates only in the region between mark and point rather than in
  the whole buffer.</p>

  <p><kbd>C-x * u</kbd> is also a handy way to activate a formula,
  such as an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; formula that has freshly been
  typed in or loaded from a file.</p>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-a-2243" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-a-2243"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dactivate-2244" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dactivate-2244"></a>The <kbd>C-x *
  a</kbd> (<code>calc-embedded-activate</code>) command scans
  through the current buffer and activates all embedded formulas
  that contain &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; symbols. This does not mean
  that Embedded mode is actually turned on, but only that the
  formulas' positions are registered with Embedded mode so that the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; values
  can be properly updated as assignments are changed.</p>

  <p>It is a good idea to type <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> right after
  loading a file that uses embedded &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operators. Emacs includes a
  nifty &ldquo;buffer-local variables&rdquo; feature that you can
  use to do this automatically. The idea is to place near the end
  of your file a few lines that look like this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     --- Local Variables: ---
     --- eval:(calc-embedded-activate) ---
     --- End: ---
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">where the leading and trailing
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">---</span></samp>&rsquo; can be
  replaced by any suitable strings (which must be the same on all
  three lines) or omitted altogether; in a TeX or LaTeX file,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; would be a
  good leading string and no trailing string would be necessary. In
  a C program, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*/</span></samp>&rsquo; would be good leading and trailing
  strings.</p>

  <p>When Emacs loads a file into memory, it checks for a Local
  Variables section like this one at the end of the file. If it
  finds this section, it does the specified things (in this case,
  running <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> automatically) before editing of the
  file begins. The Local Variables section must be within 3000
  characters of the end of the file for Emacs to find it, and it
  must be in the last page of the file if the file has any page
  separators. See <a href=
  "../emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">Local Variables in
  Files</a>.</p>

  <p>Note that <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> does not update the formulas it
  finds. To do this, type, say, <kbd>M-1 C-x * u</kbd> after
  <kbd>C-x&nbsp;*&nbsp;a</kbd><!-- /@w -->. Generally this should
  not be a problem, though, because the formulas will have been
  up-to-date already when the file was saved.</p>

  <p>Normally, <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> activates all the formulas it
  finds, but any previous active formulas remain active as well.
  With a positive numeric prefix argument, <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> first
  deactivates all current active formulas, then actives the ones it
  finds in its scan of the buffer. With a negative prefix argument,
  <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> simply deactivates all formulas.</p>

  <p>Embedded mode has two symbols, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Active</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">~Active</span></samp>&rsquo;, which it puts next to the
  major mode name in a buffer's mode line. It puts
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Active</span></samp>&rsquo; if it
  has reason to believe that all formulas in the buffer are active,
  because you have typed <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> and Calc has not since
  had to deactivate any formulas (which can happen if Calc goes to
  update an &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; formula somewhere because a
  variable changed, and finds that the formula is no longer there
  due to some kind of editing outside of Embedded mode). Calc puts
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~Active</span></samp>&rsquo; in
  the mode line if some, but probably not all, formulas in the
  buffer are active. This happens if you activate a few formulas
  one at a time but never use <kbd>C-x * a</kbd>, or if you used
  <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> but then Calc had to deactivate a formula
  because it lost track of it. If neither of these symbols appears
  in the mode line, no embedded formulas are active in the buffer
  (e.g., before Embedded mode has been used, or after a <kbd>M--
  C-x * a</kbd>).</p>

  <p>Embedded formulas can refer to assignments both before and
  after them in the buffer. If there are several assignments to a
  variable, the nearest preceding assignment is used if there is
  one, otherwise the following assignment is used.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     x =&gt; 1

     x := 1

     x =&gt; 1

     x := 2

     x =&gt; 2
</pre>

  <p>As well as simple variables, you can also assign to subscript
  expressions of the form &lsquo;<samp><var>var</var><span class=
  "samp">_</span><var>number</var></samp>&rsquo; (as in
  <code>x_0</code>), or &lsquo;<samp><var>var</var><span class=
  "samp">_</span><var>var</var></samp>&rsquo; (as in
  <code>x_max</code>). Assignments to other kinds of objects can be
  represented by Calc, but the automatic linkage between
  assignments and references works only for plain variables and
  these two kinds of subscript expressions.</p>

  <p>If there are no assignments to a given variable, the global
  stored value for the variable is used (see <a href=
  "Storing-Variables.html#Storing-Variables">Storing
  Variables</a>), or, if no value is stored, the variable is left
  in symbolic form. Note that global stored values will be lost
  when the file is saved and loaded in a later Emacs session,
  unless you have used the <kbd>s p</kbd>
  (<code>calc-permanent-variable</code>) command to save them; see
  <a href=
  "Operations-on-Variables.html#Operations-on-Variables">Operations
  on Variables</a>.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>m C</kbd> (<code>calc-auto-recompute</code>) command
  turns automatic recomputation of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; forms on and off. If you turn
  automatic recomputation off, you will have to use <kbd>C-x *
  u</kbd> to update these formulas manually after an assignment has
  been changed. If you plan to change several assignments at once,
  it may be more efficient to type <kbd>m C</kbd>, change all the
  assignments, then use <kbd>M-1 C-x * u</kbd> to update the entire
  buffer afterwards. The <kbd>m C</kbd> command also controls
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
  formulas on the stack; see <a href=
  "Evaluates_002dTo-Operator.html#Evaluates_002dTo-Operator">Evaluates-To
  Operator</a>. When you turn automatic recomputation back on, the
  stack will be updated but the Embedded buffer will not; you must
  use <kbd>C-x * u</kbd> to update the buffer by hand.</p>
