  <h5 class="subsubsection">18.5.7.1 Data Type Formats</h5>

  <p class="noindent">Integers are stored in either of two ways,
  depending on their magnitude. Integers less than one million in
  absolute value are stored as standard Lisp integers. This is the
  only storage format for Calc data objects which is not a Lisp
  list.</p>

  <p>Large integers are stored as lists of the form
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(bigpos</span> <var>d0</var>
  <var>d1</var> <var>d2</var> <span class=
  "samp">...)</span></samp>&rsquo; for positive integers 1000000 or
  more, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(bigneg</span>
  <var>d0</var> <var>d1</var> <var>d2</var> <span class=
  "samp">...)</span></samp>&rsquo; for negative integers
  <i>-1000000</i> or less. Each <var>d</var> is a base-1000
  &ldquo;digit,&rdquo; a Lisp integer from 0 to 999. The least
  significant digit is <var>d0</var>; the last digit,
  <var>dn</var>, which is always nonzero, is the most significant
  digit. For example, the integer <i>-12345678</i> is stored as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(bigneg 678 345
  12)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The distinction between small and large integers is entirely
  hidden from the user. In <code>defmath</code> definitions, the
  Lisp predicate <code>integerp</code> returns true for either kind
  of integer, and in general both big and small integers are
  accepted anywhere the word &ldquo;integer&rdquo; is used in this
  manual. If the distinction must be made, native Lisp integers are
  called <dfn>fixnums</dfn> and large integers are called
  <dfn>bignums</dfn>.</p>

  <p>Fractions are stored as a list of the form,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(frac</span> <var>n</var>
  <var>d</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; where
  <var>n</var> is an integer (big or small) numerator, <var>d</var>
  is an integer denominator greater than one, and <var>n</var> and
  <var>d</var> are relatively prime. Note that fractions where
  <var>d</var> is one are automatically converted to plain integers
  by all math routines; fractions where <var>d</var> is negative
  are normalized by negating the numerator and denominator.</p>

  <p>Floating-point numbers are stored in the form,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(float</span> <var>mant</var>
  <var>exp</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where
  <var>mant</var> (the &ldquo;mantissa&rdquo;) is an integer less
  than &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">10^</span><var>p</var></samp>&rsquo; in absolute value
  (<var>p</var> represents the current precision), and
  <var>exp</var> (the &ldquo;exponent&rdquo;) is a fixnum. The
  value of the float is &lsquo;<samp><var>mant</var> <span class=
  "samp">* 10^</span><var>exp</var></samp>&rsquo;. For example, the
  number <i>-3.14</i> is stored as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(float -314 -2) = -314*10^-2</span></samp>&rsquo;. Other
  constraints are that the number 0.0 is always stored as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(float 0 0)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  and, except for the 0.0 case, the rightmost base-10 digit of
  <var>mant</var> is always nonzero. (If the rightmost digit is
  zero, the number is rearranged by dividing <var>mant</var> by ten
  and incrementing <var>exp</var>.)</p>

  <p>Rectangular complex numbers are stored in the form
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(cplx</span> <var>re</var>
  <var>im</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where
  <var>re</var> and <var>im</var> are each real numbers, either
  integers, fractions, or floats. The value is
  &lsquo;<samp><var>re</var> <span class="samp">+</span>
  <var>im</var><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;. The
  <var>im</var> part is nonzero; complex numbers with zero
  imaginary components are converted to real numbers
  automatically.</p>

  <p>Polar complex numbers are stored in the form
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(polar</span> <var>r</var>
  <var>theta</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where
  <var>r</var> is a positive real value and <var>theta</var> is a
  real value or HMS form representing an angle. This angle is
  usually normalized to lie in the interval
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(-180 ..
  180)</span></samp>&rsquo; degrees, or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(-pi .. pi)</span></samp>&rsquo; radians, according to the
  current angular mode. If the angle is 0 the value is converted to
  a real number automatically. (If the angle is 180 degrees, the
  value is usually also converted to a negative real number.)</p>

  <p>Hours-minutes-seconds forms are stored as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(hms</span> <var>h</var>
  <var>m</var> <var>s</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>h</var> is an integer
  or an integer-valued float (i.e., a float with
  &lsquo;<samp><var>exp</var> <span class="samp">&gt;=
  0</span></samp>&rsquo;), <var>m</var> is an integer or
  integer-valued float in the range &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[0&nbsp;..&nbsp;60)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->, and
  <var>s</var> is any real number in the range
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0 ..
  60)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Date forms are stored as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(date</span> <var>n</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>n</var> is a real
  number that counts days since midnight on the morning of January
  1, 1 AD. If <var>n</var> is an integer, this is a pure date form.
  If <var>n</var> is a fraction or float, this is a date/time
  form.</p>

  <p>Modulo forms are stored as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(mod</span> <var>n</var> <var>m</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>m</var> is a positive
  real number or HMS form, and <var>n</var> is a real number or HMS
  form in the range &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0 ..</span>
  <var>m</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Error forms are stored as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(sdev</span> <var>x</var> <var>sigma</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>x</var> is the mean
  value and <var>sigma</var> is the standard deviation. Each
  component is either a number, an HMS form, or a symbolic object
  (a variable or function call). If <var>sigma</var> is zero, the
  value is converted to a plain real number. If <var>sigma</var> is
  negative or complex, it is automatically normalized to be a
  positive real.</p>

  <p>Interval forms are stored as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(intv</span> <var>mask</var> <var>lo</var>
  <var>hi</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where
  <var>mask</var> is one of the integers 0, 1, 2, or 3, and
  <var>lo</var> and <var>hi</var> are real numbers, HMS forms, or
  symbolic objects. The <var>mask</var> is a binary integer where 1
  represents the fact that the interval is closed on the high end,
  and 2 represents the fact that it is closed on the low end. (Thus
  3 represents a fully closed interval.) The interval
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(intv&nbsp;3&nbsp;</span><var>x</var><span class=
  "samp">&nbsp;</span><var>x</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> is converted to the
  plain number <var>x</var>; intervals &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(intv</span> <var>mask</var> <var>x</var>
  <var>x</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; for any
  other <var>mask</var> represent empty intervals. If <var>hi</var>
  is less than <var>lo</var>, the interval is converted to a
  standard empty interval by replacing <var>hi</var> with
  <var>lo</var>.</p>

  <p>Vectors are stored as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(vec</span> <var>v1</var> <var>v2</var> <span class=
  "samp">...)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>v1</var> is the
  first element of the vector, <var>v2</var> is the second, and so
  on. An empty vector is stored as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(vec)</span></samp>&rsquo;. A matrix is simply a vector
  where all <var>v</var>'s are themselves vectors of equal lengths.
  Note that Calc vectors are unrelated to the Emacs Lisp
  &ldquo;vector&rdquo; type, which is generally unused by Calc data
  structures.</p>

  <p>Variables are stored as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(var</span> <var>name</var> <var>sym</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>name</var> is a Lisp
  symbol whose print name is used as the visible name of the
  variable, and <var>sym</var> is a Lisp symbol in which the
  variable's value is actually stored. Thus,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(var pi
  var-pi)</span></samp>&rsquo; represents the special constant
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pi</span></samp>&rsquo;. Almost
  always, the form is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(var</span>
  <var>v</var> <span class=
  "samp">var-</span><var>v</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;. If the variable name was entered
  with <code>#</code> signs (which are converted to hyphens
  internally), the form is &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(var</span> <var>u</var> <var>v</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>u</var> is a symbol
  whose name contains <code>#</code> characters, and <var>v</var>
  is a symbol that contains <code>-</code> characters instead. The
  value of a variable is the Calc object stored in its
  <var>sym</var> symbol's value cell. If the symbol's value cell is
  void or if it contains <code>nil</code>, the variable has no
  value. Special constants have the form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(special-const</span> <var>value</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; stored in their value cell, where
  <var>value</var> is a formula which is evaluated when the
  constant's value is requested. Variables which represent units
  are not stored in any special way; they are units only because
  their names appear in the units table. If the value cell contains
  a string, it is parsed to get the variable's value when the
  variable is used.</p>

  <p>A Lisp list with any other symbol as the first element is a
  function call. The symbols <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>,
  <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>^</code>,
  and <code>|</code> represent special binary operators; these
  lists are always of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(</span><var>op</var> <var>lhs</var>
  <var>rhs</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; where
  <var>lhs</var> is the sub-formula on the lefthand side and
  <var>rhs</var> is the sub-formula on the right. The symbol
  <code>neg</code> represents unary negation; this list is always
  of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(neg</span>
  <var>arg</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Any
  other symbol <var>func</var> represents a function that would be
  displayed in function-call notation; the symbol <var>func</var>
  is in general always of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">calcFunc-</span><var>name</var></samp>&rsquo;. The
  function cell of the symbol <var>func</var> should contain a Lisp
  function for evaluating a call to <var>func</var>. This function
  is passed the remaining elements of the list (themselves already
  evaluated) as arguments; such functions should return
  <code>nil</code> or call <code>reject-arg</code> to signify that
  they should be left in symbolic form, or they should return a
  Calc object which represents their value, or a list of such
  objects if they wish to return multiple values. (The latter case
  is allowed only for functions which are the outer-level call in
  an expression whose value is about to be pushed on the stack;
  this feature is considered obsolete and is not used by any
  built-in Calc functions.)</p>
