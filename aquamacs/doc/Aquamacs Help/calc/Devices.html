  <h3 class="section">14.5 Graphical Devices</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-g-D-2164" id=
  "index-g-D-2164"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002ddevice-2165" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002ddevice-2165"></a>The <kbd>g D</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-device</code>) command sets the device name (or
  &ldquo;terminal name&rdquo; in GNUPLOT lingo) to be used by
  <kbd>g p</kbd> commands on this graph. It does not affect the
  permanent default device name. If you enter a blank name, the
  device name reverts to the default. Enter
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; to see a
  list of supported devices.</p>

  <p>With a positive numeric prefix argument, <kbd>g D</kbd>
  instead sets the default device name, used by all plots in the
  future which do not override it with a plain <kbd>g D</kbd>
  command. If you enter a blank line this command shows you the
  current default. The special name <code>default</code> signifies
  that Calc should choose <code>x11</code> if the X window system
  is in use (as indicated by the presence of a <code>DISPLAY</code>
  environment variable), <code>windows</code> on MS-Windows, or
  otherwise <code>dumb</code> under GNUPLOT 3.0 and later, or
  <code>postscript</code> under GNUPLOT 2.0. This is the initial
  default value.</p>

  <p>The <code>dumb</code> device is an interface to &ldquo;dumb
  terminals,&rdquo; i.e., terminals with no special graphics
  facilities. It writes a crude picture of the graph composed of
  characters like <code>-</code> and <code>|</code> to a buffer
  called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo;, which Calc then displays. The graph
  is made the same size as the Emacs screen, which on most dumb
  terminals will be <!-- @math{80\times24} -->
   80x24 characters. The graph is displayed in an Emacs
  &ldquo;recursive edit&rdquo;; type <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>C-c
  C-c</kbd> to exit the recursive edit and return to Calc. Note
  that the <code>dumb</code> device is present only in GNUPLOT 3.0
  and later versions.</p>

  <p>The word <code>dumb</code> may be followed by two numbers
  separated by spaces. These are the desired width and height of
  the graph in characters. Also, the device name <code>big</code>
  is like <code>dumb</code> but creates a graph four times the
  width and height of the Emacs screen. You will then have to
  scroll around to view the entire graph. In the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, &lt;SPC&gt;, &lt;DEL&gt;,
  <kbd>&lt;</kbd>, and <kbd>&gt;</kbd> are defined to scroll by one
  screenful in each of the four directions.</p>

  <p>With a negative numeric prefix argument, <kbd>g D</kbd> sets
  or displays the device name used by <kbd>g P</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-print</code>). This is initially
  <code>postscript</code>. If you don't have a PostScript printer,
  you may decide once again to use <code>dumb</code> to create a
  plot on any text-only printer.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-O-2166" id="index-g-O-2166"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002doutput-2167" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002doutput-2167"></a>The <kbd>g O</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-output</code>) command sets the name of the
  output file used by GNUPLOT. For some devices, notably
  <code>x11</code> and <code>windows</code>, there is no output
  file and this information is not used. Many other
  &ldquo;devices&rdquo; are really file formats like
  <code>postscript</code>; in these cases the output in the desired
  format goes into the file you name with <kbd>g O</kbd>. Type
  <kbd>g O stdout &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to set GNUPLOT to write to its
  standard output stream, i.e., to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo;. This is the default
  setting.</p>

  <p>Another special output name is <code>tty</code>, which means
  that GNUPLOT is going to write graphics commands directly to its
  standard output, which you wish Emacs to pass through to your
  terminal. Tektronix graphics terminals, among other devices,
  operate this way. Calc does this by telling GNUPLOT to write to a
  temporary file, then running a sub-shell executing the command
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cat tempfile
  &gt;/dev/tty</span></samp>&rsquo;. On typical Unix systems, this
  will copy the temporary file directly to the terminal, bypassing
  Emacs entirely. You will have to type <kbd>C-l</kbd> to Emacs
  afterwards to refresh the screen.</p>

  <p>Once again, <kbd>g O</kbd> with a positive or negative prefix
  argument sets the default or printer output file names,
  respectively. In each case you can specify <code>auto</code>,
  which causes Calc to invent a temporary file name for each <kbd>g
  p</kbd> (or <kbd>g P</kbd>) command. This temporary file will be
  deleted once it has been displayed or printed. If the output file
  name is not <code>auto</code>, the file is not automatically
  deleted.</p>

  <p>The default and printer devices and output files can be saved
  permanently by the <kbd>m m</kbd> (<code>calc-save-modes</code>)
  command. The default number of data points (see <kbd>g N</kbd>)
  and the X geometry (see <kbd>g X</kbd>) are also saved. Other
  graph information is <em>not</em> saved; you can save a graph's
  configuration simply by saving the contents of the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer.</p>

  "index-calc_002dgnuplot_002dprint_002doutput-2173"></a>You may
  wish to configure the default and printer devices and output
  files for the whole system. The relevant Lisp variables are
  <code>calc-gnuplot-default-device</code> and
  <code>-output</code>, and <code>calc-gnuplot-print-device</code>
  and <code>-output</code>. The output file names must be either
  strings as described above, or Lisp expressions which are
  evaluated on the fly to get the output file names.</p>

  <p>Other important Lisp variables are
  <code>calc-gnuplot-plot-command</code> and
  <code>calc-gnuplot-print-command</code>, which give the system
  commands to display or print the output of GNUPLOT, respectively.
  These may be <code>nil</code> if no command is necessary, or
  strings which can include &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; to signify the name of the file to
  be displayed or printed. Or, these variables may contain Lisp
  expressions which are evaluated to display or print the output.
  These variables are customizable (see <a href=
  "Customizing-Calc.html#Customizing-Calc">Customizing
  Calc</a>).</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-x-2174" id="index-g-x-2174"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002ddisplay-2175" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002ddisplay-2175"></a>The <kbd>g x</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-display</code>) command lets you specify on
  which X window system display your graphs should be drawn. Enter
  a blank line to see the current display name. This command has no
  effect unless the current device is <code>x11</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-X-2176" id="index-g-X-2176"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dgeometry-2177" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dgeometry-2177"></a>The <kbd>g X</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-geometry</code>) command is a similar command
  for specifying the position and size of the X window. The normal
  value is <code>default</code>, which generally means your window
  manager will let you place the window interactively. Entering
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">800x500+0+0</span></samp>&rsquo;
  would create an 800-by-500 pixel window in the upper-left corner
  of the screen. This command has no effect if the current device
  is <code>windows</code>.</p>

  <p>The buffer called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; holds a transcript of the session
  with GNUPLOT. This shows the commands Calc has
  &ldquo;typed&rdquo; to GNUPLOT and the responses it has received.
  Calc tries to notice when an error message has appeared here and
  display the buffer for you when this happens. You can check this
  buffer yourself if you suspect something has gone wrong<a rel=
  "footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id=
  "fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-C-2178" id="index-g-C-2178"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dcommand-2179" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dcommand-2179"></a>The <kbd>g C</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-command</code>) command prompts you to enter
  any line of text, then simply sends that line to the current
  GNUPLOT process. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer looks deceptively like a Shell
  buffer but you can't type commands in it yourself. Instead, you
  must use <kbd>g C</kbd> for this purpose.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-v-2180" id="index-g-v-2180"></a><a name=
  "index-g-V-2181" id="index-g-V-2181"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dview_002dcommands-2182" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dview_002dcommands-2182"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dview_002dtrail-2183" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dview_002dtrail-2183"></a>The <kbd>g
  v</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-view-commands</code>) and <kbd>g
  V</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-view-trail</code>) commands display the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffers,
  respectively, in another window. This happens automatically when
  Calc thinks there is something you will want to see in either of
  these buffers. If you type <kbd>g v</kbd> or <kbd>g V</kbd> when
  the relevant buffer is already displayed, the buffer is hidden
  again. (Note that on MS-Windows, the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer will usually
  show nothing of interest, because GNUPLOT's responses are not
  communicated back to Calc.)</p>

  <p>One reason to use <kbd>g v</kbd> is to add your own commands
  to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
  Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer. Press <kbd>g v</kbd>, then
  use <kbd>C-x o</kbd> to switch into that window. For example,
  GNUPLOT has &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set
  label</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">set arrow</span></samp>&rsquo; commands that allow you to
  annotate your plots. Since Calc doesn't understand these
  commands, you have to add them to the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*Gnuplot Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer yourself,
  then use <kbd>g&nbsp;p</kbd><!-- /@w --> to replot using these
  new commands. Note that your commands must appear <em>before</em>
  the <code>plot</code> command. To get help on any GNUPLOT
  feature, type, e.g., <kbd>g C help set label</kbd>. You may have
  to type <kbd>g C &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> a few times to clear the
  &ldquo;press return for more&rdquo; or &ldquo;subtopic of
  <small class="dots">...</small>&rdquo; requests. Note that Calc
  always sends commands (like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set
  nolabel</span></samp>&rsquo;) to reset all plotting parameters to
  the defaults before each plot, so to delete a label all you need
  to do is delete the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set
  label</span></samp>&rsquo; line you added (or comment it out with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;) and then
  replot with <kbd>g p</kbd>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-q-2184" id="index-g-q-2184"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dquit-2185" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dquit-2185"></a>You can use <kbd>g
  q</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-quit</code>) to kill the GNUPLOT
  process that is running. The next graphing command you give will
  start a fresh GNUPLOT process. The word &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">Graph</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in the Calc window's
  mode line whenever a GNUPLOT process is currently running. The
  GNUPLOT process is automatically killed when you exit Emacs if
  you haven't killed it manually by then.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g-K-2186" id="index-g-K-2186"></a><a name=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dkill-2187" id=
  "index-calc_002dgraph_002dkill-2187"></a>The <kbd>g K</kbd>
  (<code>calc-graph-kill</code>) command is like <kbd>g q</kbd>
  except that it also views the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer so that you
  can see the process being killed. This is better if you are
  killing GNUPLOT because you think it has gotten stuck.</p>

    <h4>Footnotes</h4>

    <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1" id=
    "fn-1">1</a>]</small> On MS-Windows, due to the peculiarities
    of how the Windows version of GNUPLOT (called
    <samp><span class="command">wgnuplot</span></samp>) works, the
    GNUPLOT responses are not communicated back to Calc. Instead,
    you need to look them up in the GNUPLOT command window that is
    displayed as in normal interactive usage of GNUPLOT.</p>
