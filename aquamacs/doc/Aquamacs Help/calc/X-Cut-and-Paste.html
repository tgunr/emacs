  <h3 class="section">15.7 X Cut and Paste</h3>

  <p class="noindent">If you are using Emacs with the X window
  system, there is an easier way to move small amounts of data into
  and out of the calculator: Use the mouse-oriented cut and paste
  facilities of X.</p>

  <p>The default bindings for a three-button mouse cause the left
  button to move the Emacs cursor to the given place, the right
  button to select the text between the cursor and the clicked
  location, and the middle button to yank the selection into the
  buffer at the clicked location. So, if you have a Calc window and
  an editing window on your Emacs screen, you can use
  left-click/right-click to select a number, vector, or formula
  from one window, then middle-click to paste that value into the
  other window. When you paste text into the Calc window, Calc
  interprets it as an algebraic entry. It doesn't matter where you
  click in the Calc window; the new value is always pushed onto the
  top of the stack.</p>

  <p>The <code>xterm</code> program that is typically used for
  general-purpose shell windows in X interprets the mouse buttons
  in the same way. So you can use the mouse to move data between
  Calc and any other Unix program. One nice feature of
  <code>xterm</code> is that a double left-click selects one word,
  and a triple left-click selects a whole line. So you can usually
  transfer a single number into Calc just by double-clicking on it
  in the shell, then middle-clicking in the Calc window.</p>
