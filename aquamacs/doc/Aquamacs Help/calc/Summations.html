  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-Summation-of-a-series-1829"
  id="index-Summation-of-a-series-1829"></a><a name=
  "index-a-_002b-1830" id="index-a-_002b-1830"></a><a name=

  "index-sum-1832"></a>The <kbd>a +</kbd>
  (<code>calc-summation</code>) [<code>sum</code>] command computes
  the sum of a formula over a certain range of index values. The
  formula is taken from the top of the stack; the command prompts
  for the name of the summation index variable, the lower limit of
  the sum (any formula), and the upper limit of the sum. If you
  enter a blank line at any of these prompts, that prompt and any
  later ones are answered by reading additional elements from the
  stack. Thus, <kbd>' k^2 &lt;RET&gt; ' k &lt;RET&gt; 1 &lt;RET&gt;
  5 &lt;RET&gt; a + &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> produces the result 55.</p>

  <p>The choice of index variable is arbitrary, but it's best not
  to use a variable with a stored value. In particular, while
  <code>i</code> is often a favorite index variable, it should be
  avoided in Calc because <code>i</code> has the imaginary constant
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(0, 1)</span></samp>&rsquo; as a
  value. If you pressed <kbd>=</kbd> on a sum over <code>i</code>,
  it would be changed to a nonsensical sum over the
  &ldquo;variable&rdquo; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(0,
  1)</span></samp>&rsquo;! If you really want to use <code>i</code>
  as an index variable, use
  <kbd>s&nbsp;u&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><!-- /@w --> first to
  &ldquo;unstore&rdquo; this variable. (See <a href=
  "Storing-Variables.html#Storing-Variables">Storing
  Variables</a>.)</p>

  <p>A numeric prefix argument steps the index by that amount
  rather than by one. Thus <kbd>' a_k &lt;RET&gt; C-u -2 a + k
  &lt;RET&gt; 10 &lt;RET&gt; 0 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> yields
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a_10 + a_8 + a_6 + a_4 + a_2 +
  a_0</span></samp>&rsquo;. A prefix argument of plain
  <kbd>C-u</kbd> causes <kbd>a +</kbd> to prompt for the step
  value, in which case you can enter any formula or enter a blank
  line to take the step value from the stack. With the
  <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix, <kbd>a +</kbd> can take up to five
  arguments from the stack: The formula, the variable, the lower
  limit, the upper limit, and (at the top of the stack), the step
  value.</p>

  <p>Calc knows how to do certain sums in closed form. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(6 k^2, k, 1, n) = 2&nbsp;n^3
  <!-- /@w --> + 3 n^2 + n</span></samp>&rsquo;. In particular,
  this is possible if the formula being summed is polynomial or
  exponential in the index variable. Sums of logarithms are
  transformed into logarithms of products. Sums of trigonometric
  and hyperbolic functions are transformed to sums of exponentials
  and then done in closed form. Also, of course, sums in which the
  lower and upper limits are both numbers can always be evaluated
  just by grinding them out, although Calc will use closed forms
  whenever it can for the sake of efficiency.</p>

  <p>The notation for sums in algebraic formulas is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sum(</span><var>expr</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>var</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>low</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>high</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>step</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;. If
  <var>step</var> is omitted, it defaults to one. If
  <var>high</var> is omitted, <var>low</var> is actually the upper
  limit and the lower limit is one. If <var>low</var> is also
  omitted, the limits are &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">inf</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively.</p>

  <p>Infinite sums can sometimes be evaluated:
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(.5^k, k, 1,
  inf)</span></samp>&rsquo; returns &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo;. This is done by evaluating the sum
  in closed form (to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1. -
  0.5^n</span></samp>&rsquo; in this case), then evaluating this
  formula with <code>n</code> set to <code>inf</code>. Calc's usual
  rules for &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; arithmetic can find the answer
  from there. If infinite arithmetic yields a
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nan</span></samp>&rsquo;, or if
  the sum cannot be solved in closed form, Calc leaves the
  <code>sum</code> function in symbolic form. See <a href=
  "Infinities.html#Infinities">Infinities</a>.</p>

  <p>As a special feature, if the limits are infinite (or omitted,
  as described above) but the formula includes vectors subscripted
  by expressions that involve the iteration variable, Calc narrows
  the limits to include only the range of integers which result in
  valid subscripts for the vector. For example, the sum
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(k
  [a,b,c,d,e,f,g]_(2k),k)</span></samp>&rsquo; evaluates to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b + 2 d + 3
  f</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The limits of a sum do not need to be integers. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(a_k, k, 0, 2 n,
  n)</span></samp>&rsquo; produces &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a_0 + a_n + a_(2 n)</span></samp>&rsquo;. Calc computes
  the number of iterations using the formula
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 + (</span><var>high</var>
  <span class="samp">-</span> <var>low</var><span class="samp">)
  /</span> <var>step</var></samp>&rsquo;, which must, after
  simplification as if by <kbd>a s</kbd>, evaluate to an
  integer.</p>

  <p>If the number of iterations according to the above formula
  does not come out to an integer, the sum is invalid and will be
  left in symbolic form. However, closed forms are still supplied,
  and you are on your honor not to misuse the resulting formulas by
  substituting mismatched bounds into them. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(k, k, 1, 10,
  2)</span></samp>&rsquo; is invalid, but Calc will go ahead and
  evaluate the closed form solution for the limits 1 and 10 to get
  the rather dubious answer, 29.25.</p>

  <p>If the lower limit is greater than the upper limit (assuming a
  positive step size), the result is generally zero. However, Calc
  only guarantees a zero result when the upper limit is exactly one
  step less than the lower limit, i.e., if the number of iterations
  is <i>-1</i>. Thus &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(f(k), k,
  n, n-1)</span></samp>&rsquo; is zero but the sum from
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n-2</span></samp>&rsquo; may
  report a nonzero value if Calc used a closed form solution.</p>

  <p>Calc's logical predicates like &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a &lt; b</span></samp>&rsquo; return 1 for
  &ldquo;true&rdquo; and 0 for &ldquo;false.&rdquo; See <a href=
  "Logical-Operations.html#Logical-Operations">Logical
  Operations</a>. This can be used to advantage for building
  conditional sums. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sum(prime(k)*k^2, k, 1, 20)</span></samp>&rsquo; is the
  sum of the squares of all prime numbers from 1 to 20; the
  <code>prime</code> predicate returns 1 if its argument is prime
  and 0 otherwise. You can read this expression as &ldquo;the sum
  of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k^2</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  prime.&rdquo; Indeed, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sum(prime(k)*k^2, k)</span></samp>&rsquo; would represent
  the sum of <em>all</em> primes squared, since the limits default
  to plus and minus infinity, but there are no such sums that
  Calc's built-in rules can do in closed form.</p>

  <p>As another example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum((k !=
  k_0) * f(k), k, 1, n)</span></samp>&rsquo; is the sum of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(k)</span></samp>&rsquo; for all
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo; from 1 to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, excluding
  one value &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">k_0</span></samp>&rsquo;. Slightly more tricky is the
  summand &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(k != k_0) / (k -
  k_0)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is an attempt to describe the
  sum of all &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1/(k-k_0)</span></samp>&rsquo; except at
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k = k_0</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  where this would be a division by zero. But at
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k = k_0</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  this formula works out to the indeterminate form
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0 / 0</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
  Calc will not assume is zero. Better would be to use
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(k != k_0) ? 1/(k-k_0) :
  0</span></samp>&rsquo;; the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?
  :</span></samp>&rsquo; operator does an
  &ldquo;if-then-else&rdquo; test: This expression says, &ldquo;if
  <!-- @math{k \ne k_0}, -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k != k_0</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  then &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1/(k-k_0)</span></samp>&rsquo;, else zero.&rdquo; Now the
  formula &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1/(k-k_0)</span></samp>&rsquo; will not even be evaluated
  by Calc when &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k =
  k_0</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  "index-asum-1836" id="index-asum-1836"></a>The <kbd>a -</kbd>
  (<code>calc-alt-summation</code>) [<code>asum</code>] command
  computes an alternating sum. Successive terms of the sequence are
  given alternating signs, with the first term (corresponding to
  the lower index value) being positive. Alternating sums are
  converted to normal sums with an extra term of the form
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(-1)^(k-</span><var>low</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;. This formula is adjusted
  appropriately if the step value is other than one. For example,
  the Taylor series for the sine function is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">asum(x^k / k!, k, 1, inf,
  2)</span></samp>&rsquo;. (Calc cannot evaluate this infinite
  series, but it can approximate it if you replace <code>inf</code>
  with any particular odd number.) Calc converts this series to a
  regular sum with a step of one, namely &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">sum((-1)^k x^(2k+1) / (2k+1)!, k, 0,
  inf)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  (<code>calc-product</code>) [<code>prod</code>] command is the
  analogous way to take a product of many terms. Calc also knows
  some closed forms for products, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">prod(k, k, 1, n) = n!</span></samp>&rsquo;. Conditional
  products can be written &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">prod(k^prime(k), k, 1, n)</span></samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prod(prime(k) ? k : 1, k, 1,
  n)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  "index-table-1843"></a>The <kbd>a T</kbd>
  (<code>calc-tabulate</code>) [<code>table</code>] command
  evaluates a formula at a series of iterated index values, just
  like <code>sum</code> and <code>prod</code>, but its result is
  simply a vector of the results. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">table(a_i, i, 1, 7,
  2)</span></samp>&rsquo; produces &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
