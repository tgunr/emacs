  <h4 class="subsection">2.5.6 Embedded Mode (Overview)</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><dfn>Embedded mode</dfn> is a way to use Calc
  directly from inside an editing buffer. Suppose you have a
  formula written as part of a document like this:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     The derivative of

                                        ln(ln(x))

     is
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">and you wish to have Calc compute and format
  the derivative for you and store this derivative in the buffer
  automatically. To do this with Embedded mode, first copy the
  formula down to where you want the result to be, leaving a blank
  line before and after the formula:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     The derivative of

                                        ln(ln(x))

     is

                                        ln(ln(x))
</pre>

  <p>Now, move the cursor onto this new formula and press <kbd>C-x
  * e</kbd>. Calc will read the formula (using the surrounding
  blank lines to tell how much text to read), then push this
  formula (invisibly) onto the Calc stack. The cursor will stay on
  the formula in the editing buffer, but the line with the formula
  will now appear as it would on the Calc stack (in this case, it
  will be left-aligned) and the buffer's mode line will change to
  look like the Calc mode line (with mode indicators like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12 Deg</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  so on). Even though you are still in your editing buffer, the
  keyboard now acts like the Calc keyboard, and any new result you
  get is copied from the stack back into the buffer. To take the
  derivative, you would type <kbd>a d x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     The derivative of

                                        ln(ln(x))

     is

     1 / ln(x) x
</pre>

  <p>(Note that by default, Calc gives division lower precedence
  than multiplication, so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 /
  ln(x) x</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / (ln(x)
  x)</span></samp>&rsquo;.)</p>

  <p>To make this look nicer, you might want to press <kbd>d
  =</kbd> to center the formula, and even <kbd>d B</kbd> to use Big
  display mode.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     The derivative of

                                        ln(ln(x))

     is
     % [calc-mode: justify: center]
     % [calc-mode: language: big]

                                            1
                                         -------
                                         ln(x) x
</pre>

  <p>Calc has added annotations to the file to help it remember the
  modes that were used for this formula. They are formatted like
  comments in the TeX typesetting language, just in case you are
  using TeX or LaTeX. (In this example TeX is not being used, so
  you might want to move these comments up to the top of the file
  or otherwise put them out of the way.)</p>

  <p>As an extra flourish, we can add an equation number using a
  righthand label: Type <kbd>d } (1) &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     % [calc-mode: justify: center]
     % [calc-mode: language: big]
     % [calc-mode: right-label: " (1)"]

                                            1
                                         -------                      (1)
                                         ln(x) x
</pre>

  <p>To leave Embedded mode, type <kbd>C-x * e</kbd> again. The
  mode line and keyboard will revert to the way they were
  before.</p>

  <p>The related command <kbd>C-x * w</kbd> operates on a single
  word, which generally means a single number, inside text. It
  searches for an expression which &ldquo;looks&rdquo; like a
  number containing the point. Here's an example of its use:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     A slope of one-third corresponds to an angle of 1 degrees.
</pre>

  <p>Place the cursor on the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo;, then type <kbd>C-x * w</kbd> to
  enable Embedded mode on that number. Now type <kbd>3 /</kbd> (to
  get one-third), and <kbd>I T</kbd> (the Inverse Tangent converts
  a slope into an angle), then <kbd>C-x&nbsp;*&nbsp;w</kbd>
  <!-- /@w --> again to exit Embedded mode.</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     A slope of one-third corresponds to an angle of 18.4349488229 degrees.
