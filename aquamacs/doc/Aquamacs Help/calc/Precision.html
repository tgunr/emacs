  <h3 class="section">7.2 Precision</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-p-400" id=
  "index-p-400"></a><a name="index-calc_002dprecision-401" id=
  "index-calc_002dprecision-401"></a><a name=
  "index-Precision-of-calculations-402" id=
  "index-Precision-of-calculations-402"></a>The <kbd>p</kbd>
  (<code>calc-precision</code>) command controls the precision to
  which floating-point calculations are carried. The precision must
  be at least 3 digits and may be arbitrarily high, within the
  limits of memory and time. This affects only floats: Integer and
  rational calculations are always carried out with as many digits
  as necessary.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>p</kbd> key prompts for the current precision. If you
  wish you can instead give the precision as a numeric prefix
  argument.</p>

  <p>Many internal calculations are carried to one or two digits
  higher precision than normal. Results are rounded down afterward
  to the current precision. Unless a special display mode has been
  selected, floats are always displayed with their full stored
  precision, i.e., what you see is what you get. Reducing the
  current precision does not round values already on the stack, but
  those values will be rounded down before being used in any
  calculation. The <kbd>c 0</kbd> through <kbd>c 9</kbd> commands
  (see <a href="Conversions.html#Conversions">Conversions</a>) can
  be used to round an existing value to a new precision.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Accuracy-of-calculations-403" id=
  "index-Accuracy-of-calculations-403"></a>It is important to
  distinguish the concepts of <dfn>precision</dfn> and
  <dfn>accuracy</dfn>. In the normal usage of these words, the
  number 123.4567 has a precision of 7 digits but an accuracy of 4
  digits. The precision is the total number of digits not counting
  leading or trailing zeros (regardless of the position of the
  decimal point). The accuracy is simply the number of digits after
  the decimal point (again not counting trailing zeros). In Calc
  you control the precision, not the accuracy of computations. If
  you were to set the accuracy instead, then calculations like
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(100)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  would generate many more digits than you would typically need,
  while &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">exp(-100)</span></samp>&rsquo; would probably round to
  zero! In Calc, both these computations give you exactly 12 (or
  the requested number of) significant digits.</p>

  <p>The only Calc features that deal with accuracy instead of
  precision are fixed-point display mode for floats (<kbd>d
  f</kbd>; see <a href="Float-Formats.html#Float-Formats">Float
  Formats</a>), and the rounding functions like <code>floor</code>
  and <code>round</code> (see <a href=
  "Integer-Truncation.html#Integer-Truncation">Integer
  Truncation</a>). Also, <kbd>c 0</kbd> through <kbd>c 9</kbd> deal
  with both precision and accuracy depending on the magnitudes of
  the numbers involved.</p>

  <p>If you need to work with a particular fixed accuracy (say,
  dollars and cents with two digits after the decimal point), one
  solution is to work with integers and an &ldquo;implied&rdquo;
  decimal point. For example, $8.99 divided by 6 would be entered
  <kbd>899 &lt;RET&gt; 6 /</kbd>, yielding 149.833 (actually
  $1.49833 with our implied decimal point); pressing <kbd>R</kbd>
  would round this to 150 cents, i.e., $1.50.</p>

  <p>See <a href="Floats.html#Floats">Floats</a>, for still more on
  floating-point precision and related issues.</p>
