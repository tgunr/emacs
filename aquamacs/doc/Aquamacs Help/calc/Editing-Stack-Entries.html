  <h3 class="section">6.2 Editing Stack Entries</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-g_t_0060-343" id=
  "index-g_t_0060-343"></a><a name="index-calc_002dedit-344" id=
  "index-calc_002dedit-344"></a><a name=

  "index-Editing-the-stack-with-Emacs-346" id=
  "index-Editing-the-stack-with-Emacs-346"></a>The <kbd>`</kbd>
  (<code>calc-edit</code>) command creates a temporary buffer
  (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Calc
  Edit*</span></samp>&rsquo;) for editing the top-of-stack value
  using regular Emacs commands. Note that <kbd>`</kbd> is a
  backquote, not a quote. With a numeric prefix argument, it edits
  the specified number of stack entries at once. (An argument of
  zero edits the entire stack; a negative argument edits one
  specific stack entry.)</p>

  <p>When you are done editing, press <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to finish
  and return to Calc. The &lt;RET&gt; and &lt;LFD&gt; keys also
  work to finish most sorts of editing, though in some cases Calc
  leaves &lt;RET&gt; with its usual meaning (&ldquo;insert a
  newline&rdquo;) if it's a situation where you might want to
  insert new lines into the editing buffer.</p>

  <p>When you finish editing, the Calculator parses the lines of
  text in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Calc
  Edit*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer as numbers or formulas,
  replaces the original stack elements in the original buffer with
  these new values, then kills the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*Calc Edit*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer. The original
  Calculator buffer continues to exist during editing, but for best
  results you should be careful not to change it until you have
  finished the edit. You can also cancel the edit by killing the
  buffer with <kbd>C-x k</kbd>.</p>

  <p>The formula is normally reevaluated as it is put onto the
  stack. For example, editing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a +
  2</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 +
  2</span></samp>&rsquo; and pressing <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> will push
  5 on the stack. If you use &lt;LFD&gt; to finish, Calc will put
  the result on the stack without evaluating it.</p>

  <p>If you give a prefix argument to <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, Calc will
  not kill the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Calc
  Edit*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer. You can switch back to that
  buffer and continue editing if you wish. However, you should
  understand that if you initiated the edit with <kbd>`</kbd>, the
  <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> operation will be programmed to replace the
  top of the stack with the new edited value, and it will do this
  even if you have rearranged the stack in the meanwhile. This is
  not so much of a problem with other editing commands, though,
  such as <kbd>s e</kbd> (<code>calc-edit-variable</code>; see
  <a href=
  "Operations-on-Variables.html#Operations-on-Variables">Operations
  on Variables</a>).</p>

  <p>If the <code>calc-edit</code> command involves more than one
  stack entry, each line of the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">*Calc Edit*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer is interpreted as
  a separate formula. Otherwise, the entire buffer is interpreted
  as one formula, with line breaks ignored. (You can use
  <kbd>C-o</kbd> or <kbd>C-q C-j</kbd> to insert a newline in the
  buffer without pressing &lt;RET&gt;.)</p>

  <p>The <kbd>`</kbd> key also works during numeric or algebraic
  entry. The text entered so far is moved to the <code>*Calc
  Edit*</code> buffer for more extensive editing than is convenient
  in the minibuffer.</p>
