  <h4 class="subsection">8.5.4 Time Zones</h4>

  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-Time-zones-851" id=
  "index-Time-zones-851"></a><a name=
  "index-Daylight-saving-time-852" id=
  "index-Daylight-saving-time-852"></a>Time zones and daylight
  saving time are a complicated business. The conversions to and
  from Julian and Unix-style dates automatically compute the
  correct time zone and daylight saving adjustment to use, provided
  they can figure out this information. This section describes
  Calc's time zone adjustment algorithm in detail, in case you want
  to do conversions in different time zones or in case Calc's
  algorithms can't determine the right correction to use.</p>

  <p>Adjustments for time zones and daylight saving time are done
  by <kbd>t U</kbd>, <kbd>t J</kbd>, <kbd>t N</kbd>, and <kbd>t
  C</kbd>, but not by any other commands. In particular,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;may 1 1991&gt; - &lt;apr 1
  1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; evaluates to exactly 30 days even
  though there is a daylight-saving transition in between. This is
  also true for Julian pure dates: &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">julian(&lt;may 1 1991&gt;) - julian(&lt;apr 1
  1991&gt;)</span></samp>&rsquo;. But Julian and Unix date/times
  will adjust for daylight saving time: using Calc's default
  daylight saving time rule (see the explanation below),
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">julian(&lt;12am may 1 1991&gt;) -
  julian(&lt;12am apr 1 1991&gt;)</span></samp>&rsquo; evaluates to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">29.95833</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (that's 29 days and 23 hours) because one hour was lost when
  daylight saving commenced on April 7, 1991.</p>

  <p>In brief, the idiom &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">julian(</span><var>date1</var><span class="samp">) -
  julian(</span><var>date2</var><span class=
  "samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; computes the actual number of
  24-hour periods between two dates, whereas
  &lsquo;<samp><var>date1</var> <span class="samp">-</span>
  <var>date2</var></samp>&rsquo; computes the number of calendar
  days between two dates without taking daylight saving into
  account.</p>

  <p><a name="index-calc_002dtime_002dzone-853" id=
  "index-calc_002dtime_002dzone-853"></a><a name="index-tzone-854"
  id="index-tzone-854"></a>The <code>calc-time-zone</code>
  [<code>tzone</code>] command converts the time zone specified by
  its numeric prefix argument into a number of seconds difference
  from Greenwich mean time (GMT). If the argument is a number, the
  result is simply that value multiplied by 3600. Typical arguments
  for North America are 5 (Eastern) or 8 (Pacific). If Daylight
  Saving time is in effect, one hour should be subtracted from the
  normal difference.</p>

  <p>If you give a prefix of plain <kbd>C-u</kbd>,
  <code>calc-time-zone</code> (like other date arithmetic commands
  that include a time zone argument) takes the zone argument from
  the top of the stack. (In the case of <kbd>t J</kbd> and <kbd>t
  U</kbd>, the normal argument is then taken from the second-to-top
  stack position.) This allows you to give a non-integer time zone
  adjustment. The time-zone argument can also be an HMS form, or it
  can be a variable which is a time zone name in upper- or
  lower-case. For example &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">tzone(PST) = tzone(8)</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tzone(pdt) =
  tzone(7)</span></samp>&rsquo; (for Pacific standard and daylight
  saving times, respectively).</p>

  <p>North American and European time zone names are defined as
  follows; note that for each time zone there is one name for
  standard time, another for daylight saving time, and a third for
  &ldquo;generalized&rdquo; time in which the daylight saving
  adjustment is computed from context.</p>

  <p><a name="index-math_002dtzone_002dnames-855" id=
  "index-math_002dtzone_002dnames-855"></a>To define time zone
  names that do not appear in the above table, you must modify the
  Lisp variable <code>math-tzone-names</code>. This is a list of
  lists describing the different time zone names; its structure is
  best explained by an example. The three entries for Pacific Time
  look like this:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     ( ( "PST" 8 0 )    ; Name as an upper-case string, then standard
       ( "PDT" 8 -1 )   ; adjustment, then daylight saving adjustment.
       ( "PGT" 8 "PST" "PDT" ) )   ; Generalized time zone.
</pre>

  <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bTimeZone_007d-variable-856"
  id="index-g_t_0040code_007bTimeZone_007d-variable-856"></a><a name="index-TimeZone-857"
  id="index-TimeZone-857"></a>With no arguments,
  <code>calc-time-zone</code> or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">tzone()</span></samp>&rsquo; will by default get the time
  zone and daylight saving information from the calendar (see
  <a href=
  "../emacs/Daylight-Saving.html#Daylight-Saving">Calendar/Diary</a>).
  To use a different time zone, or if the calendar does not give
  the desired result, you can set the Calc variable
  <code>TimeZone</code> (which is by default <code>nil</code>) to
  an appropriate time zone name. (The easiest way to do this is to
  edit the <code>TimeZone</code> variable using Calc's <kbd>s
  T</kbd> command, then use the <kbd>s p</kbd>
  (<code>calc-permanent-variable</code>) command to save the value
  of <code>TimeZone</code> permanently.) If the time zone given by
  <code>TimeZone</code> is a generalized time zone, e.g.,
  <code>EGT</code>, Calc examines the date being converted to tell
  whether to use standard or daylight saving time. But if the
  current time zone is explicit, e.g., <code>EST</code> or
  <code>EDT</code>, then that adjustment is used exactly and Calc's
  daylight saving algorithm is not consulted. The special time zone
  name <code>local</code> is equivalent to no argument; i.e., it
  uses the information obtained from the calendar.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>t J</kbd> and <code>t U</code> commands with no
  numeric prefix arguments do the same thing as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tzone()</span></samp>&rsquo;;
  namely, use the information from the calendar if
  <code>TimeZone</code> is <code>nil</code>, otherwise use the time
  zone given by <code>TimeZone</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-math_002ddaylight_002dsavings_002dhook-858" id=
  "index-math_002ddaylight_002dsavings_002dhook-858"></a><a name=
  "index-math_002dstd_002ddaylight_002dsavings-859" id=
  "index-math_002dstd_002ddaylight_002dsavings-859"></a>When Calc
  computes the daylight saving information itself (i.e., when the
  <code>TimeZone</code> variable is set), it will by default
  consider daylight saving time to begin at 2 a.m. on the second
  Sunday of March (for years from 2007 on) or on the last Sunday in
  April (for years before 2007), and to end at 2 a.m. on the first
  Sunday of November. (for years from 2007 on) or the last Sunday
  in October (for years before 2007). These are the rules that have
  been in effect in much of North America since 1966 and take into
  account the rule change that began in 2007. If you are in a
  country that uses different rules for computing daylight saving
  time, you have two choices: Write your own daylight saving hook,
  or control time zones explicitly by setting the
  <code>TimeZone</code> variable and/or always giving a time-zone
  argument for the conversion functions.</p>

  <p>The Lisp variable <code>math-daylight-savings-hook</code>
  holds the name of a function that is used to compute the daylight
  saving adjustment for a given date. The default is
  <code>math-std-daylight-savings</code>, which computes an
  adjustment (either 0 or <i>-1</i>) using the North American rules
  given above.</p>

  <p>The daylight saving hook function is called with four
  arguments: The date, as a floating-point number in standard Calc
  format; a six-element list of the date decomposed into year,
  month, day, hour, minute, and second, respectively; a string
  which contains the generalized time zone name in upper-case,
  e.g., <code>"WEGT"</code>; and a special adjustment to be applied
  to the hour value when converting into a generalized time zone
  (see below).</p>

  <p><a name="index-math_002dprev_002dweekday_002din_002dmonth-860"
  id="index-math_002dprev_002dweekday_002din_002dmonth-860"></a>The
  Lisp function <code>math-prev-weekday-in-month</code> is useful
  for daylight saving computations. This is an internal version of
  the user-level <code>pwday</code> function described in the
  previous section. It takes four arguments: The floating-point
  date value, the corresponding six-element date list, the
  day-of-month number, and the weekday number (0-6).</p>

  <p>The default daylight saving hook ignores the time zone name,
  but a more sophisticated hook could use different algorithms for
  different time zones. It would also be possible to use different
  algorithms depending on the year number, but the default hook
  always uses the algorithm for 1987 and later. Here is a listing
  of the default daylight saving hook:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     (defun math-std-daylight-savings (date dt zone bump)
       (cond ((&lt; (nth 1 dt) 4) 0)
             ((= (nth 1 dt) 4)
              (let ((sunday (math-prev-weekday-in-month date dt 7 0)))
                (cond ((&lt; (nth 2 dt) sunday) 0)
                      ((= (nth 2 dt) sunday)
                       (if (&gt;= (nth 3 dt) (+ 3 bump)) -1 0))
                      (t -1))))
             ((&lt; (nth 1 dt) 10) -1)
             ((= (nth 1 dt) 10)
              (let ((sunday (math-prev-weekday-in-month date dt 31 0)))
                (cond ((&lt; (nth 2 dt) sunday) -1)
                      ((= (nth 2 dt) sunday)
                       (if (&gt;= (nth 3 dt) (+ 2 bump)) 0 -1))
                      (t 0))))
             (t 0))
     )
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The <code>bump</code> parameter is equal to
  zero when Calc is converting from a date form in a generalized
  time zone into a GMT date value. It is <i>-1</i> when Calc is
  converting in the other direction. The adjustments shown above
  ensure that the conversion behaves correctly and reasonably
  around the 2 a.m. transition in each direction.</p>

  <p>There is a &ldquo;missing&rdquo; hour between 2 a.m. and 3
  a.m. at the beginning of daylight saving time; converting a
  date/time form that falls in this hour results in a time value
  for the following hour, from 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. At the end of
  daylight saving time, the hour from 1 a.m. to 2 a.m. repeats
  itself; converting a date/time form that falls in this hour
  results in a time value for the first manifestation of that time
  (<em>not</em> the one that occurs one hour later).</p>

  <p>If <code>math-daylight-savings-hook</code> is
  <code>nil</code>, then the daylight saving adjustment is always
  taken to be zero.</p>

  <p>In algebraic formulas, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">tzone(</span><var>zone</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>date</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; computes
  the time zone adjustment for a given zone name at a given date.
  The <var>date</var> is ignored unless <var>zone</var> is a
  generalized time zone. If <var>date</var> is a date form, the
  daylight saving computation is applied to it as it appears. If
  <var>date</var> is a numeric date value, it is adjusted for the
  daylight-saving version of <var>zone</var> before being given to
  the daylight saving hook. This odd-sounding rule ensures that the
  daylight-saving computation is always done in local time, not in
  the GMT time that a numeric <var>date</var> is typically
  represented in.</p>

  <p><a name="index-dsadj-861" id="index-dsadj-861"></a>The
  &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">dsadj(</span><var>date</var><span class="samp">,</span>
  <var>zone</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; function
  computes the daylight saving adjustment that is appropriate for
  <var>date</var> in time zone <var>zone</var>. If <var>zone</var>
  is explicitly in or not in daylight saving time (e.g.,
  <code>PDT</code> or <code>PST</code>) the <var>date</var> is
  ignored. If <var>zone</var> is a generalized time zone, the
  algorithms described above are used. If <var>zone</var> is
  omitted, the computation is done for the current time zone.</p>
