  <h4 class="subsection">11.3.4 Simplification of Units</h4>

  <p class="noindent">The simplifications described in this section
  are applied by the <kbd>u s</kbd>
  (<code>calc-simplify-units</code>) command. These are in addition
  to the regular <kbd>a s</kbd> (but not <kbd>a e</kbd>)
  simplifications described earlier. See <a href=
  "Basic-Operations-on-Units.html#Basic-Operations-on-Units">Basic
  Operations on Units</a>.</p>

  <p>The variable <code>UnitSimpRules</code> contains rewrites to
  be applied by the <kbd>u s</kbd> command. These are applied in
  addition to <code>EvalRules</code> and
  <code>AlgSimpRules</code>.</p>

  <p>Scalar mode is automatically put into effect when simplifying
  units. See <a href="Matrix-Mode.html#Matrix-Mode">Matrix
  Mode</a>.</p>

  <p>Sums &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a +
  b</span></samp>&rsquo; involving units are simplified by
  extracting the units of &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; as if by the <kbd>u x</kbd> command
  (call the result &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">u_a</span></samp>&rsquo;), then simplifying the expression
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b / u_a</span></samp>&rsquo;
  using <kbd>u b</kbd> and <kbd>u s</kbd>. If the result has units
  then the sum is inconsistent and is left alone. Otherwise, it is
  rewritten in terms of the units &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">u_a</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If units auto-ranging mode is enabled, products or quotients
  in which the first argument is a number which is out of range for
  the leading unit are modified accordingly.</p>

  <p>When cancelling and combining units in products and quotients,
  Calc accounts for unit names that differ only in the prefix
  letter. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 km
  m</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2000 m^2</span></samp>&rsquo;. However, compatible but
  different units like <code>ft</code> and <code>in</code> are not
  combined in this way.</p>

  <p>Quotients &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a /
  b</span></samp>&rsquo; are simplified in three additional ways.
  First, if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;
  is a number or a product beginning with a number, Calc computes
  the reciprocal of this number and moves it to the numerator.</p>

  <p>Second, for each pair of unit names from the numerator and
  denominator of a quotient, if the units are compatible (e.g.,
  they are both units of area) then they are replaced by the ratio
  between those units. For example, in &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">3 s in N / kg cm</span></samp>&rsquo; the units
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">in / cm</span></samp>&rsquo; will
  be replaced by &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">2.54</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Third, if the units in the quotient exactly cancel out, so
  that a <kbd>u b</kbd> command on the quotient would produce a
  dimensionless number for an answer, then the quotient simplifies
  to that number.</p>

  <p>For powers and square roots, the &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;
  simplifications &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a
  b)^c</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a^c
  b^c</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(a/b)^c</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a^c / b^c</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a^b)^c</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  <!-- @math{a^{b c}} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a^(b c)</span></samp>&rsquo; are
  done if the powers are real numbers. (These are safe in the
  context of units because all numbers involved can reasonably be
  assumed to be real.)</p>

  <p>Also, if a unit name is raised to a fractional power, and the
  base units in that unit name all occur to powers which are a
  multiple of the denominator of the power, then the unit name is
  expanded out into its base units, which can then be simplified
  according to the previous paragraph. For example,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">acre^1.5</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  simplified by noting that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.5 =
  3:2</span></samp>&rsquo;, that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">acre</span></samp>&rsquo; is defined in terms of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m^2</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
  that the 2 in the power of <code>m</code> is a multiple of 2 in
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3:2</span></samp>&rsquo;. Thus,
  <code>acre^1.5</code> is replaced by approximately
  <!-- @math{(4046 m^2)^{1.5}} -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(4046
  m^2)^1.5</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is then changed to
  <!-- @math{4046^{1.5} \, (m^2)^{1.5}}, -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4046^1.5
  (m^2)^1.5</span></samp>&rsquo;, then to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">257440 m^3</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>The functions <code>float</code>, <code>frac</code>,
  <code>clean</code>, <code>abs</code>, as well as
  <code>floor</code> and the other integer truncation functions,
  applied to unit names or products or quotients involving units,
  are simplified. For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">round(1.6 in)</span></samp>&rsquo; is changed to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">round(1.6)
  round(in)</span></samp>&rsquo;; the lefthand term evaluates to 2,
  and the righthand term simplifies to <code>in</code>.</p>

  <p>The functions <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, and
  <code>tan</code> with arguments that have angular units like
  <code>rad</code> or <code>arcmin</code> are simplified by
  converting to base units (radians), then evaluating with the
  angular mode temporarily set to radians.</p>
