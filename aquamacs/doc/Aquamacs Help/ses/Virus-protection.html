  <p><a name="index-virus-protection-82" id=
  "index-virus-protection-82"></a> Whenever a formula or printer is
  read from a file or is pasted into the spreadsheet, it receives a
  &ldquo;needs safety check&rdquo; marking. Later, when the formula
  or printer is evaluated for the first time, it is checked for
  safety using the <code>unsafep</code> predicate; if found to be
  &ldquo;possibly unsafe&rdquo;, the questionable formula or
  printer is displayed and you must press Y to approve it or N to
  use a substitute. The substitute always signals an error.</p>

  <p>Formulas or printers that you type in are checked immediately
  for safety. If found to be possibly unsafe and you press N to
  disapprove, the action is canceled and the old formula or printer
  will remain.</p>

  <p>Besides viruses (which try to copy themselves to other files),
  <code>unsafep</code> can also detect all other kinds of Trojan
  horses, such as spreadsheets that delete files, send email, flood
  Web sites, alter your Emacs settings, etc.</p>

  <p>Generally, spreadsheet formulas and printers are simple things
  that don't need to do any fancy computing, so all
  potentially-dangerous parts of the Emacs Lisp environment can be
  excluded without cramping your style as a formula-writer. See the
  documentation in <samp><span class=
  "file">unsafep.el</span></samp> for more info on how Lisp forms
  are classified as safe or unsafe.</p>
