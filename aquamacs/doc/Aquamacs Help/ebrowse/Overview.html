  <h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

  <p>When working in software projects using C++, I frequently
  missed software support for two things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When you get a new class library, or you have to work on
    source code you haven't written yourself (or written
    sufficiently long ago), you need a tool to let you navigate
    class hierarchies and investigate features of the software.
    Without such a tool you often end up <samp><span class=
    "command">grep</span></samp>ing through dozens or even hundreds
    of files.</li>

    <li>Once you are productive, it would be nice to have a tool
    that knows your sources and can help you while you are editing
    source code. Imagine to be able to jump to the definition of an
    identifier while you are editing, or something that can
    complete long identifier names because it knows what
    identifiers are defined in your program<small class=
    "dots">...</small>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The design of Ebrowse reflects these two needs.</p>

  <p>How does it work?</p>

  <p><a name="index-parser-for-C_002b_002b-sources-1" id=
  "index-parser-for-C_002b_002b-sources-1"></a>A fast parser
  written in C is used to process C++ source files. The parser
  generates a data base containing information about classes,
  members, global functions, defines, types etc. found in the
  sources.</p>

  <p>The second part of Ebrowse is a Lisp program. This program
  reads the data base generated by the parser. It displays its
  contents in various forms and allows you to perform operations on
  it, or do something with the help of the knowledge contained in
  the data base.</p>

  <p><a name="index-major-modes_002c-of-Ebrowse-buffers-2" id=
  "index-major-modes_002c-of-Ebrowse-buffers-2"></a><dfn>Navigational</dfn>
  use of Ebrowse is centered around two types of buffers which
  define their own major modes:</p>

  <p><a name="index-tree-buffer-3" id=
  "index-tree-buffer-3"></a><dfn>Tree buffers</dfn> are used to
  view class hierarchies in tree form. They allow you to quickly
  find classes, find or view class declarations, perform operations
  like query replace on sets of your source files, and finally tree
  buffers are used to produce the second buffer form&mdash;member
  buffers. See <a href="Tree-Buffers.html#Tree-Buffers">Tree
  Buffers</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-member-buffer-4" id=
  "index-member-buffer-4"></a>Members are displayed in <dfn>member
  buffers</dfn>. Ebrowse distinguishes between six different types
  of members; each type is displayed as a member list of its
  own:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Instance member variables;</li>

    <li>Instance member functions;</li>

    <li>Static member variables;</li>

    <li>Static member functions;</li>

    <li>Friends/Defines. The list of defines is contained in the
    friends list of the pseudo-class &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">*Globals*</span></samp>&rsquo;;</li>

    <li>Types (<code>enum</code>s, and <code>typedef</code>s
    defined with class scope).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can switch member buffers from one list to another, or to
  another class. You can include inherited members in the display,
  you can set filters that remove categories of members from the
  display, and most importantly you can find or view member
  declarations and definitions with a keystroke. See <a href=
  "Member-Buffers.html#Member-Buffers">Member Buffers</a>.</p>

  <p>These two buffer types and the commands they provide support
  the navigational use of the browser. The second form resembles
  Emacs' Tags package for C and other procedural languages.
  Ebrowse's commands of this type are not confined to special
  buffers; they are most often used while you are editing your
  source code.</p>

  <p>To list just a subset of what you can use the Tags part of
  Ebrowse for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Jump to the definition or declaration of an identifier in
    your source code, with an electric position stack that lets you
    easily navigate back and forth.</li>

    <li>Complete identifiers in your source with a completion list
    containing identifiers from your source code only.</li>

    <li>Perform search and query replace operations over some or
    all of your source files.</li>

    <li>Show all identifiers matching a regular
    expression&mdash;and jump to one of them, if you like.</li>
  </ul>
