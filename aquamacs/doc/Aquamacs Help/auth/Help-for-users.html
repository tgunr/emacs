  <h2 class="chapter">2 Help for users</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;Netrc&rdquo; files are a de facto standard. They look
  like this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     machine <var>mymachine</var> login <var>myloginname</var> password <var>mypassword</var> port <var>myport</var>
</pre>

  <p>The machine is the server (either a DNS name or an IP
  address).</p>

  <p>The port is optional. If it's missing, auth-source will assume
  any port is OK. Actually the port is a protocol name or a port
  number so you can have separate entries for port <var>143</var>
  and for protocol <var>imap</var> if you fancy that. Anyway, you
  can just omit the port if you don't need it.</p>

  <p>The login and password are simply your login credentials to
  the server.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Netrc&rdquo; files are usually called
  <code>.authinfo</code> or <code>.netrc</code>; nowadays
  <code>.authinfo</code> seems to be more popular and the
  auth-source library encourages this confusion by making it the
  default, as you'll see later.</p>

  <p>If you have problems with the port, set
  <code>auth-source-debug</code> to <code>t</code> and see what
  port the library is checking in the <code>*Messages*</code>
  buffer. Ditto for any other problems, your first step is always
  to see what's being checked. The second step, of course, is to
  write a blog entry about it and wait for the answer in the
  comments.</p>

  <p>You can customize the variable <code>auth-sources</code>. The
  following may be needed if you are using an older version of
  Emacs or if the auth-source library is not loaded for some other
  reason.</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (require 'auth-source)             ;; probably not necessary
     (customize-variable 'auth-sources) ;; optional, do it once
</pre>

  <div class="defun">
    &mdash; Variable: <b>auth-sources</b><var><a name=
    "index-auth_002dsources-1" id=
    "index-auth_002dsources-1"></a></var><br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>The <code>auth-sources</code> variable tells the
      auth-source library where your netrc files or Secret Service
      API collection items live for a particular host and protocol.
      While you can get fancy, the default and simplest
      configuration is:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          ;;; old default: required :host and :protocol, not needed anymore
          (setq auth-sources '((:source "~/.authinfo.gpg" :host t :protocol t)))
          ;;; mostly equivalent (see below about fallbacks) but shorter:
          (setq auth-sources '((:source "~/.authinfo.gpg")))
</pre>

      <p>This says &ldquo;for any host and any protocol, use just
      that one file.&rdquo; Sweet simplicity. In fact, the latter
      is already the default, so unless you want to move your netrc
      file, it will just work if you have that file. Make sure it
      exists.</p>

      <p>By adding multiple entries to <code>auth-sources</code>
      with a particular host or protocol, you can have specific
      netrc files for that host or protocol. Usually this is
      unnecessary but may make sense if you have shared netrc files
      or some other unusual setup (90% of Emacs users have unusual
      setups and the remaining 10% are <em>really</em>
      unusual).</p>

      <p>Here's an example that uses the Secret Service API for all
      lookups, using the default collection:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (setq auth-sources '((:source (:secrets default))))
</pre>

      <p>And here's a mixed example, using two sources:</p>
      <pre class="lisp">
          (setq auth-sources '((:source (:secrets default) :host "myserver" :user "joe")
                               (:source "~/.authinfo.gpg")))
</pre>

      <p>The best match is determined by order (starts from the
      bottom) only for the first pass, where things are checked
      exactly. In the example above, the first pass would find a
      single match for host <code>myserver</code>. The netrc choice
      would fail because it matches any host and protocol
      implicitly (as a <em>fallback</em>). A specified value of
      <code>:host t</code> in <code>auth-sources</code> is
      considered a match on the first pass, unlike a missing
      <code>:host</code>.</p>

      <p>Now if you look for host <code>missing</code>, it won't
      match either source explicitly. The second pass (the
      <em>fallback</em> pass) will look at all the implicit matches
      and collect them. They will be scored and returned sorted by
      score. The score is based on the number of explicit
      parameters that matched. See the <code>auth-pick</code>
      function for details.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <p>If you don't customize <code>auth-sources</code>, you'll have
  to live with the defaults: any host and any port are looked up in
  the netrc file <code>~/.authinfo.gpg</code>, which is a GnuPG
  encrypted file (see <a href=
  "GnuPG-and-EasyPG-Assistant-Configuration.html#GnuPG-and-EasyPG-Assistant-Configuration">
  GnuPG and EasyPG Assistant Configuration</a>).</p>

  <p>The simplest working netrc line example is one without a
  port.</p>
  <pre class="example">
     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password YOURPASSWORD
</pre>

  <p>This will match any authentication port. Simple, right? But
  what if there's a SMTP server on port 433 of that machine that
  needs a different password from the IMAP server?</p>
  <pre class="example">
     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password SMTPPASSWORD port 433
     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password GENERALPASSWORD
</pre>

  <p>For url-auth authentication (HTTP/HTTPS), you need to put this
  in your netrc file:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     machine yourmachine.com:80 port http login testuser password testpass
</pre>

  <p>This will match any realm and authentication method (basic or
  digest) over HTTP. HTTPS is set up similarly. If you want finer
  controls, explore the url-auth source code and variables.</p>

  <p>For Tramp authentication, use:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     machine yourmachine.com port scp login testuser password testpass
</pre>

  <p>Note that the port denotes the Tramp connection method. When
  you don't use a port entry, you match any Tramp method, as
  explained earlier. Since Tramp has about 88 connection methods,
  this may be necessary if you have an unusual (see earlier comment
  on those) setup.</p>
