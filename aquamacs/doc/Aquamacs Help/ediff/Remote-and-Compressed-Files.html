  <h2 class="chapter">6 Remote and Compressed Files</h2>

  <p>Ediff works with remote, compressed, and encrypted files.
  Ediff supports <samp><span class=
  "file">ange-ftp.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "file">jka-compr.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "file">uncompress.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class=
  "file">crypt++.el</span></samp>, but it may work with other
  similar packages as well. This means that you can compare files
  residing on another machine, or you can apply a patch to a file
  on another machine. Even the patch itself can be a remote
  file!</p>

  <p>When patching compressed or remote files, Ediff does not
  rename the source file (unlike what the <code>patch</code>
  utility would usually do). Instead, the source file retains its
  name and the result of applying the patch is placed in a
  temporary file that has the suffix <samp><span class=
  "file">_patched</span></samp> attached. Generally, this applies
  to files that are handled using black magic, such as special file
  handlers (ange-ftp and some compression and encryption packages
  also use this method).</p>

  <p>Regular files are treated by the <code>patch</code> utility in
  the usual manner, i.e., the original is renamed into
  <samp><span class="file">source-name.orig</span></samp> and the
  result of the patch is placed into the file source-name
  (<samp><span class="file">_orig</span></samp> is used on systems
  like DOS, etc.)</p>
