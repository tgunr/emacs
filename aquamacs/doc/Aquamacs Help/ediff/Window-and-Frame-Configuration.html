  <h3 class="section">7.3 Window and Frame Configuration</h3>

  <p>On a non-windowing display, Ediff sets things up in one frame,
  splitting it between a small control window and the windows for
  buffers A, B, and C. The split between these windows can be
  horizontal or vertical, which can be changed interactively by
  typing <kbd>|</kbd> while the cursor is in the control
  window.</p>

  <p>On a window display, Ediff sets up a dedicated frame for Ediff
  Control Panel and then it chooses windows as follows: If one of
  the buffers is invisible, it is displayed in the currently
  selected frame. If a buffer is visible, it is displayed in the
  frame where it is visible. If, according to the above criteria,
  the two buffers fall into the same frame, then so be it&mdash;the
  frame will be shared by the two. The same algorithm works when
  you type <kbd>C-l</kbd> (<code>ediff-recenter</code>),
  <kbd>p</kbd> (<code>ediff-previous-difference</code>),
  <kbd>n</kbd> (<code>ediff-next-difference</code>), etc.</p>

  <p>The above behavior also depends on whether the current frame
  is splittable, dedicated, etc. Unfortunately, the margin of this
  book is too narrow to present the details of this remarkable
  algorithm.</p>

  <p>The upshot of all this is that you can compare buffers in one
  frame or in different frames. The former is done by default,
  while the latter can be achieved by arranging buffers A, B (and
  C, if applicable) to be seen in different frames. Ediff respects
  these arrangements, automatically adapting itself to the
  multi-frame mode.</p>

  <p>Ediff uses the following variables to set up its control panel
  (a.k.a. control buffer, a.k.a. quick help window):</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>ediff-control-frame-parameters</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name=
      "index-ediff_002dcontrol_002dframe_002dparameters-150" id=
      "index-ediff_002dcontrol_002dframe_002dparameters-150"></a>You
      can change or augment this variable including the font,
      color, etc. The X resource name of Ediff Control Panel frames
      is &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">Ediff</span></samp>&rsquo;. Under X-windows, you can
      use this name to set up preferences in your
      <samp><span class="file">~/.Xdefaults</span></samp>,
      <samp><span class="file">~/.xrdb</span></samp>, or whatever X
      resource file is in use. Usually this is preferable to
      changing <code>ediff-control-frame-parameters</code>
      directly. For instance, you can specify in <samp><span class=
      "file">~/.Xdefaults</span></samp> the color of the control
      frame using the resource &lsquo;<samp><span class=
      "samp">Ediff*background</span></samp>&rsquo;.

      <p>In general, any X resource pertaining the control frame
      can be reached via the prefix <code>Ediff*</code>.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-control-frame-position-function</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name=
      "index-ediff_002dcontrol_002dframe_002dposition_002dfunction-151"
      id=
      "index-ediff_002dcontrol_002dframe_002dposition_002dfunction-151">
      </a>The preferred way of specifying the position of the
      control frame is by setting the variable
      <code>ediff-control-frame-position-function</code> to an
      appropriate function. The default value of this variable is
      <code>ediff-make-frame-position</code>. This function places
      the control frame in the vicinity of the North-East corner of
      the frame displaying buffer A.

      <p><a name="index-ediff_002dmake_002dframe_002dposition-152"
      id="index-ediff_002dmake_002dframe_002dposition-152"></a></p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The following variables can be used to adjust the location
  produced by <code>ediff-make-frame-position</code> and for
  related customization.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>ediff-narrow-control-frame-leftward-shift</code></dt>

    <dd><a name=
    "index-ediff_002dnarrow_002dcontrol_002dframe_002dleftward_002dshift-153"
    id=
    "index-ediff_002dnarrow_002dcontrol_002dframe_002dleftward_002dshift-153">
    </a>Specifies the number of characters for shifting the control
    frame from the rightmost edge of frame A when the control frame
    is displayed as a small window.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-wide-control-frame-rightward-shift</code></dt>

    <dd><a name=
    "index-ediff_002dwide_002dcontrol_002dframe_002drightward_002dshift-154"
    id=
    "index-ediff_002dwide_002dcontrol_002dframe_002drightward_002dshift-154">
    </a>Specifies the rightward shift of the control frame from the
    left edge of frame A when the control frame shows the full menu
    of options.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-control-frame-upward-shift</code></dt>

    <dd><a name=
    "index-ediff_002dcontrol_002dframe_002dupward_002dshift-155"
    id="index-ediff_002dcontrol_002dframe_002dupward_002dshift-155">
    </a>Specifies the number of pixels for the upward shift of the
    control frame.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-prefer-iconified-control-frame</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name=
      "index-ediff_002dprefer_002diconified_002dcontrol_002dframe-156"
      id=
      "index-ediff_002dprefer_002diconified_002dcontrol_002dframe-156">
      </a>If this variable is <code>t</code>, the control frame
      becomes iconified automatically when you toggle the quick
      help message off. This saves valuable real estate on the
      screen. Toggling help back will deiconify the control frame.

      <p>To start Ediff with an iconified Control Panel, you should
      set this variable to <code>t</code> and
      <code>ediff-prefer-long-help-message</code> to
      <code>nil</code> (see <a href=
      "Quick-Help-Customization.html#Quick-Help-Customization">Quick
      Help Customization</a>). This behavior is useful only if
      icons are allowed to accept keyboard input (which depends on
      the window manager and other factors).</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p><a name="index-ediff_002dsetup_002dwindows-157" id=
  "index-ediff_002dsetup_002dwindows-157"></a>To make more creative
  changes in the way Ediff sets up windows, you can rewrite the
  function <code>ediff-setup-windows</code>. However, we believe
  that detaching Ediff Control Panel from the rest and making it
  into a separate frame offers an important opportunity by allowing
  you to iconify that frame. The icon will usually accept all of
  the Ediff commands, but will free up valuable real estate on your
  screen (this may depend on your window manager, though).</p>

  <p>The following variable controls how windows are set up:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>ediff-window-setup-function</code></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-ediff_002dwindow_002dsetup_002dfunction-158"
    id="index-ediff_002dwindow_002dsetup_002dfunction-158"></a>The
    multiframe setup is done by the
    <code>ediff-setup-windows-multiframe</code> function, which is
    the default on windowing displays. The plain setup, one where
    all windows are always in one frame, is done by
    <code>ediff-setup-windows-plain</code>, which is the default on
    a non-windowing display (or in an xterm window). In fact, under
    Emacs, you can switch freely between these two setups by
    executing the command <code>ediff-toggle-multiframe</code>
    using the Minibuffer of the Menubar. <a name=
    "index-ediff_002dsetup_002dwindows_002dmultiframe-159" id=
    "index-ediff_002dsetup_002dwindows_002dmultiframe-159"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dsetup_002dwindows_002dplain-160"
    id=
    "index-ediff_002dsetup_002dwindows_002dplain-160"></a><a name=
    "index-ediff_002dtoggle_002dmultiframe-161" id=
    "index-ediff_002dtoggle_002dmultiframe-161"></a> If you don't
    like any of these setups, write your own function. See the
    documentation for <code>ediff-window-setup-function</code> for
    the basic guidelines. However, writing window setups is not
    easy, so you should first take a close look at
    <code>ediff-setup-windows-plain</code> and
    <code>ediff-setup-windows-multiframe</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>You can run multiple Ediff sessions at once, by invoking Ediff
  several times without exiting previous Ediff sessions. Different
  sessions may even operate on the same pair of files.</p>

  <p>Each session has its own Ediff Control Panel and all the
  regarding a particular session is local to the associated control
  panel buffer. You can switch between sessions by suspending one
  session and then switching to another control panel. (Different
  control panel buffers are distinguished by a numerical suffix,
  e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ediff Control
  Panel&lt;3&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.)</p>
