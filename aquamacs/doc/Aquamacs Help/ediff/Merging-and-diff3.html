  <h3 class="section">7.9 Merging and diff3</h3>

  <p>Ediff supports three-way comparison via the functions
  <code>ediff-files3</code> and <code>ediff-buffers3</code>. The
  interface is the same as for two-way comparison. In three-way
  comparison and merging, Ediff reports if any two difference
  regions are identical. For instance, if the current region in
  buffer A is the same as the region in buffer C, then the mode
  line of buffer A will display &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[=diff(C)]</span></samp>&rsquo; and the mode line of
  buffer C will display &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[=diff(A)]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Merging is done according to the following algorithm.</p>

  <p>If a difference region in one of the buffers, say B, differs
  from the ancestor file while the region in the other buffer, A,
  doesn't, then the merge buffer, C, gets B's region. Similarly
  when buffer A's region differs from the ancestor and B's doesn't,
  A's region is used.</p>

  <p><a name="index-ediff_002ddefault_002dvariant-207" id=
  "index-ediff_002ddefault_002dvariant-207"></a>If both regions in
  buffers A and B differ from the ancestor file, Ediff chooses the
  region according to the value of the variable
  <code>ediff-default-variant</code>. If its value is
  <code>default-A</code> then A's region is chosen. If it is
  <code>default-B</code> then B's region is chosen. If it is
  <code>combined</code> then the region in buffer C will look like
  this:
  <!-- Use @set to avoid triggering merge conflict detectors like CVS. --></p>
  <pre class="example">
     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; variant A
     the difference region from buffer A
     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; variant B
     the difference region from buffer B
     ####### Ancestor
     the difference region from the ancestor buffer, if available
     ======= end
</pre>

  <p>The above is the default template for the combined region. The
  user can customize this template using the variable
  <code>ediff-combination-pattern</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-ediff_002dcombination_002dpattern-208" id=
  "index-ediff_002dcombination_002dpattern-208"></a>The variable
  <code>ediff-combination-pattern</code> specifies the template
  that determines how the combined merged region looks like. The
  template is represented as a list of the form <code>(STRING1
  Symbol1 STRING2 Symbol2 STRING3 Symbol3 STRING4)</code>. The
  symbols here must be atoms of the form <code>A</code>,
  <code>B</code>, or <code>Ancestor</code>. They determine the
  order in which the corresponding difference regions (from buffers
  A, B, and the ancestor buffer) are displayed in the merged region
  of buffer C. The strings in the template determine the text that
  separates the aforesaid regions. The default template is</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     ("&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; variant A" A "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; variant B" B
        "####### Ancestor" Ancestor "======= end")
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(this is one long line) and the corresponding
  combined region is shown above. The order in which the regions
  are shown (and the separator strings) can be changed by changing
  the above template. It is even possible to add or delete region
  specifiers in this template (although the only possibly useful
  such modification seems to be the deletion of the ancestor).</p>

  <p>In addition to the state of the difference, Ediff displays the
  state of the merge for each region. If a difference came from
  buffer A by default (because both regions A and B were different
  from the ancestor and <code>ediff-default-variant</code> was set
  to <code>default-A</code>) then &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[=diff(A) default-A]</span></samp>&rsquo; is displayed in
  the mode line. If the difference in buffer C came, say, from
  buffer B because the difference region in that buffer differs
  from the ancestor, but the region in buffer A does not (if
  merging with an ancestor) then &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[=diff(B) prefer-B]</span></samp>&rsquo; is displayed. The
  indicators default-A/B and prefer-A/B are inspired by Emerge and
  have the same meaning.</p>

  <p>Another indicator of the state of merge is
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">combined</span></samp>&rsquo;. It
  appears with any difference region in buffer C that was obtained
  by combining the difference regions in buffers A and B as
  explained above.</p>

  <p>In addition to the state of merge and state of difference
  indicators, while merging with an ancestor file or buffer, Ediff
  informs the user when the current difference region in the
  (normally invisible) ancestor buffer is empty via the
  <em>AncestorEmpty</em> indicator. This helps determine if the
  changes made to the original in variants A and B represent pure
  insertion or deletion of text: if the mode line shows
  <em>AncestorEmpty</em> and the corresponding region in buffers A
  or B is not empty, this means that new text was inserted. If this
  indicator is not present and the difference regions in buffers A
  or B are non-empty, this means that text was modified. Otherwise,
  the original text was deleted.</p>

  <p>Although the ancestor buffer is normally invisible, Ediff
  maintains difference regions there and advances the current
  difference region accordingly. All highlighting of difference
  regions is provided in the ancestor buffer, except for the fine
  differences. Therefore, if desired, the user can put the ancestor
  buffer in a separate frame and watch it there. However, on a TTY,
  only one frame can be visible at any given time, and Ediff
  doesn't support any single-frame window configuration where all
  buffers, including the ancestor buffer, would be visible.
  However, the ancestor buffer can be displayed by typing
  <kbd>/</kbd> to the control window. (Type <kbd>C-l</kbd> to hide
  it again.)</p>

  <p>Note that the state-of-difference indicators
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=diff(A)</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=diff(B)</span></samp>&rsquo;
  above are not redundant, even in the presence of a state-of-merge
  indicator. In fact, the two serve different purposes.</p>

  <p>For instance, if the mode line displays
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=diff(B)
  prefer(B)</span></samp>&rsquo; and you copy a difference region
  from buffer A to buffer C then &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=diff(B)</span></samp>&rsquo; will change to
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">diff-A</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  the mode line will display &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">=diff(A) prefer-B</span></samp>&rsquo;. This indicates
  that the difference region in buffer C is identical to that in
  buffer A, but originally buffer C's region came from buffer B.
  This is useful to know because you can recover the original
  difference region in buffer C by typing <kbd>r</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Ediff never changes the state-of-merge indicator, except in
  response to the <kbd>!</kbd> command (see below), in which case
  the indicator is lost. On the other hand, the state-of-difference
  indicator is changed automatically by the copying/recovery
  commands, <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>b</kbd>, <kbd>r</kbd>,
  <kbd>+</kbd>.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>!</kbd> command loses the information about origins
  of the regions in the merge buffer (default-A, prefer-B, or
  combined). This is because recomputing differences in this case
  means running <code>diff3</code> on buffers A, B, and the merge
  buffer, not on the ancestor buffer. (It makes no sense to
  recompute differences using the ancestor file, since in the
  merging mode Ediff assumes that you have not edited buffers A and
  B, but that you may have edited buffer C, and these changes are
  to be preserved.) Since some difference regions may disappear as
  a result of editing buffer C and others may arise, there is
  generally no simple way to tell where the various regions in the
  merge buffer came from.</p>

  <p>In three-way comparison, Ediff tries to disregard regions that
  consist entirely of white space. For instance, if, say, the
  current region in buffer A consists of the white space only (or
  if it is empty), Ediff will not take it into account for the
  purpose of computing fine differences. The result is that Ediff
  can provide a better visual information regarding the actual fine
  differences in the non-white regions in buffers B and C.
  Moreover, if the regions in buffers B and C differ in the white
  space only, then a message to this effect will be displayed.</p>

  <p><a name="index-ediff_002dmerge_002dwindow_002dshare-209" id=
  "index-ediff_002dmerge_002dwindow_002dshare-209"></a>In the merge
  mode, the share of the split between window C (the window
  displaying the merge-buffer) and the windows displaying buffers A
  and B is controlled by the variable
  <code>ediff-merge-window-share</code>. Its default value is 0.5.
  To make the merge-buffer window smaller, reduce this amount.</p>

  <p>We don't recommend increasing the size of the merge-window to
  more than half the frame (i.e., to increase the value of
  <code>ediff-merge-window-share</code>) to more than 0.5, since it
  would be hard to see the contents of buffers A and B.</p>

  <p>You can temporarily shrink the merge window to just one line
  by typing <kbd>s</kbd>. This change is temporary, until Ediff
  finds a reason to redraw the screen. Typing <kbd>s</kbd> again
  restores the original window size.</p>

  <p>With a positive prefix argument, the <kbd>s</kbd> command will
  make the merge window slightly taller. This change is persistent.
  With `<kbd>-</kbd>' or with a negative prefix argument, the
  command <kbd>s</kbd> makes the merge window slightly shorter.
  This change also persistent.</p>

  <p><a name="index-ediff_002dshow_002dclashes_002donly-210" id=
  "index-ediff_002dshow_002dclashes_002donly-210"></a>Ediff lets
  you automatically ignore the regions where only one of the
  buffers A and B disagrees with the ancestor. To do this, set the
  variable <code>ediff-show-clashes-only</code> to
  non-<code>nil</code>.</p>

  <p>You can toggle this feature interactively by typing
  <kbd>$$</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Note that this variable affects only the show next/previous
  difference commands. You can still jump directly to any
  difference region directly using the command <kbd>j</kbd> (with a
  prefix argument specifying the difference number).</p>

  <p><a name="index-ediff_002dautostore_002dmerges-211" id=
  "index-ediff_002dautostore_002dmerges-211"></a><a name=
  "index-ediff_002dquit_002dmerge_002dhook-212" id=
  "index-ediff_002dquit_002dmerge_002dhook-212"></a><a name=
  "index-ediff_002dmaybe_002dsave_002dand_002ddelete_002dmerge-213"
  id=
  "index-ediff_002dmaybe_002dsave_002dand_002ddelete_002dmerge-213"></a>The
  variable <code>ediff-autostore-merges</code> controls what
  happens to the merge buffer when Ediff quits. If the value is
  <code>nil</code>, nothing is done to the merge buffer&mdash;it
  will be the user's responsibility to save it. If the value is
  <code>t</code>, the user will be asked where to save the buffer
  and whether to delete it afterwards. It the value is neither
  <code>nil</code> nor <code>t</code>, the merge buffer is saved
  <em>only</em> if this merge session was invoked from a group of
  related Ediff session, such as those that result from
  <code>ediff-merge-directories</code>,
  <code>ediff-merge-directory-revisions</code>, etc. See <a href=
  "Session-Groups.html#Session-Groups">Session Groups</a>. This
  behavior is implemented in the function
  <code>ediff-maybe-save-and-delete-merge</code>, which is a hook
  in <code>ediff-quit-merge-hook</code>. The user can supply a
  different hook, if necessary.</p>

  <p>The variable <code>ediff-autostore-merges</code> is
  buffer-local, so it can be set in a per-buffer manner. Therefore,
  use <code>setq-default</code> to globally change this
  variable.</p>

  <p><a name="index-ediff_002dmerge_002dfilename_002dprefix-214"
  id="index-ediff_002dmerge_002dfilename_002dprefix-214"></a>When
  merge buffers are saved automatically as directed by
  <code>ediff-autostore-merges</code>, Ediff attaches a prefix to
  each file, as specified by the variable
  <code>ediff-merge-filename-prefix</code>. The default is
  <code>merge_</code>, but this can be changed by the user.</p>
