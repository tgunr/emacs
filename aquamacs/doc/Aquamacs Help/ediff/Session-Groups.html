  <h2 class="chapter">5 Session Groups</h2>

  <p>Several major entries of Ediff perform comparison and merging
  on directories. On entering <code>ediff-directories</code>,
  <code>ediff-directories3</code>,
  <code>ediff-merge-directories</code>,
  <code>ediff-merge-directories-with-ancestor</code>,
  <code>ediff-directory-revisions</code>,
  <code>ediff-merge-directory-revisions</code>, or
  <code>ediff-merge-directory-revisions-with-ancestor</code>, the
  user is presented with a Dired-like buffer that lists files
  common to the directories involved along with their sizes. (The
  list of common files can be further filtered through a regular
  expression, which the user is prompted for.) We call this buffer
  <em>Session Group Panel</em> because all Ediff sessions
  associated with the listed files will have this buffer as a
  common focal point.</p>

  <p>Clicking button 2 or typing <kbd>RET</kbd> or <kbd>v</kbd>
  over a record describing files invokes Ediff in the appropriate
  mode on these files. You can come back to the session group
  buffer associated with a particular invocation of Ediff by typing
  <kbd>M</kbd> in Ediff control buffer of that invocation.</p>

  <p>Many commands are available in the session group buffer; some
  are applicable only to certain types of work. The relevant
  commands are always listed at the top of each session group
  buffer, so there is no need to memorize them.</p>

  <p>In directory comparison or merging, a session group panel
  displays only the files common to all directories involved. The
  differences are kept in a separate <em>directory difference
  buffer</em> and are conveniently displayed by typing <kbd>D</kbd>
  to the corresponding session group panel. Thus, as an added
  benefit, Ediff can be used to compare the contents of up to three
  directories.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Directory-difference-buffer-116" id=
  "index-Directory-difference-buffer-116"></a>Sometimes it is
  desirable to copy some files from one directory to another
  without exiting Ediff. The <em>directory difference buffer</em>,
  which is displayed by typing <kbd>D</kbd> as discussed above, can
  be used for this purpose. If a file is, say, in Ediff's Directory
  A, but is missing in Ediff's Directory B (Ediff will refuse to
  override existing files), then typing <kbd>C</kbd> or clicking
  mouse button 2 over that file (which must be displayed in
  directory difference buffer) will copy that file from Directory A
  to Directory B.</p>

  <p>Session records in session group panels are also marked with
  <kbd>+</kbd>, for active sessions, and with <kbd>-</kbd>, for
  finished sessions.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, it is convenient to exclude certain sessions from a
  group. Usually this happens when the user doesn't intend to run
  Ediff of certain files in the group, and the corresponding
  session records just add clutter to the session group buffer. To
  help alleviate this problem, the user can type <kbd>h</kbd> to
  mark a session as a candidate for exclusion and <kbd>x</kbd> to
  actually hide the marked sessions. There actions are reversible:
  with a prefix argument, <kbd>h</kbd> unmarks the session under
  the cursor, and <kbd>x</kbd> brings the hidden sessions into the
  view (<kbd>x</kbd> doesn't unmark them, though, so the user has
  to explicitly unmark the sessions of interest).</p>

  <p>Group sessions also understand the command <kbd>m</kbd>, which
  marks sessions for future operations (other than hiding) on a
  group of sessions. At present, the only such group-level
  operation is the creation of a multi-file patch.</p>

  <p><a name="index-ediff_002dautostore_002dmerges-117" id=
  "index-ediff_002dautostore_002dmerges-117"></a>For group sessions
  created to merge files, Ediff can store all merges automatically
  in a directory. The user is asked to specify such directory if
  the value of <code>ediff-autostore-merges</code> is
  non-<code>nil</code>. If the value is <code>nil</code>, nothing
  is done to the merge buffers&mdash;it will be the user's
  responsibility to save them. If the value is <code>t</code>, the
  user will be asked where to save the merge buffers in all merge
  jobs, even those that do not originate from a session group. It
  the value is neither <code>nil</code> nor <code>t</code>, the
  merge buffer is saved <em>only</em> if this merge session was
  invoked from a session group. This behavior is implemented in the
  function <code>ediff-maybe-save-and-delete-merge</code>, which is
  a hook in <code>ediff-quit-merge-hook</code>. The user can supply
  a different hook, if necessary.</p>

  <p>The variable <code>ediff-autostore-merges</code> is
  buffer-local, so it can be set on a per-buffer basis. Therefore,
  use <code>setq-default</code> to change this variable
  globally.</p>

  <p><a name="index-Multi_002dfile-patches-118" id=
  "index-Multi_002dfile-patches-118"></a>A multi-file patch is a
  concatenated output of several runs of the Unix <code>diff</code>
  command (some versions of <code>diff</code> let you create a
  multi-file patch in just one run). Ediff facilitates creation of
  multi-file patches as follows. If you are in a session group
  buffer created in response to <code>ediff-directories</code> or
  <code>ediff-directory-revisions</code>, you can mark (by typing
  <kbd>m</kbd>) the desired Ediff sessions and then type
  <kbd>P</kbd> to create a multi-file patch of those marked
  sessions. Ediff will then display a buffer containing the patch.
  The patch is generated by invoking <code>diff</code> on all
  marked individual sessions (represented by files) and session
  groups (represented by directories). Ediff will also recursively
  descend into any <em>unmarked</em> session group and will search
  for marked sessions there. In this way, you can create multi-file
  patches that span file subtrees that grow out of any given
  directory.</p>

  <p>In an <code>ediff-directories</code> session, it is enough to
  just mark the requisite sessions. In
  <code>ediff-directory-revisions</code> revisions, the marked
  sessions must also be active, or else Ediff will refuse to
  produce a multi-file patch. This is because, in the latter-style
  sessions, there are many ways to create diff output, and it is
  easier to handle by running Ediff on the inactive sessions.</p>

  <p>Last, but not least, by typing <kbd>==</kbd>, you can quickly
  find out which sessions have identical entries, so you won't have
  to run Ediff on those sessions. This, however, works only on
  local, uncompressed files. For compressed or remote files, this
  command won't report anything. Likewise, you can use
  <kbd>=h</kbd> to mark sessions with identical entries for hiding
  or, with <kbd>=m</kbd>, for further operations.</p>

  <p>The comparison operations <kbd>==</kbd>, <kbd>=h</kbd>, and
  <kbd>=m</kbd> can recurse into subdirectories to see if they have
  identical contents (so the user will not need to descend into
  those subdirectories manually). These commands ask the user
  whether or not to do a recursive descent.</p>
