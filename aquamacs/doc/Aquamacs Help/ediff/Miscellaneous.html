  <h3 class="section">7.12 Miscellaneous</h3>

  <p>Here are a few other variables for customizing Ediff:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>ediff-split-window-function</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-ediff_002dsplit_002dwindow_002dfunction-223"
      id=
      "index-ediff_002dsplit_002dwindow_002dfunction-223"></a>Controls
      the way you want the window be split between file-A and
      file-B (and file-C, if applicable). It defaults to the
      vertical split (<code>split-window-vertically</code>, but you
      can set it to <code>split-window-horizontally</code>, if you
      so wish. Ediff also lets you switch from vertical to
      horizontal split and back interactively.

      <p>Note that if Ediff detects that all the buffers it
      compares are displayed in separate frames, it assumes that
      the user wants them to be so displayed and stops splitting
      windows. Instead, it arranges for each buffer to be displayed
      in a separate frame. You can switch to the one-frame mode by
      hiding one of the buffers A/B/C.</p>

      <p>You can also swap the windows where buffers are displayed
      by typing <kbd>~</kbd>.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-merge-split-window-function</code></dt>

    <dd><a name=
    "index-ediff_002dmerge_002dsplit_002dwindow_002dfunction-224"
    id=
    "index-ediff_002dmerge_002dsplit_002dwindow_002dfunction-224"></a>Controls
    how windows are split between buffers A and B in the merge
    mode. This variable is like
    <code>ediff-split-window-function</code>, but it defaults to
    <code>split-window-horizontally</code> instead of
    <code>split-window-vertically</code>.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-make-wide-display-function</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name=
      "index-ediff_002dmake_002dwide_002ddisplay_002dfunction-225"
      id=
      "index-ediff_002dmake_002dwide_002ddisplay_002dfunction-225"></a>The
      value is a function to be called to widen the frame for
      displaying the Ediff buffers. See the on-line documentation
      for <code>ediff-make-wide-display-function</code> for
      details. It is also recommended to look into the source of
      the default function <code>ediff-make-wide-display</code>.

      <p>You can toggle wide/regular display by typing
      <kbd>m</kbd>. In the wide display mode, buffers A, B (and C,
      when applicable) are displayed in a single frame that is as
      wide as the entire workstation screen. This is useful when
      files are compared side-by-side. By default, the display is
      widened without changing its height.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-use-last-dir</code></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-ediff_002duse_002dlast_002ddir-226" id=
    "index-ediff_002duse_002dlast_002ddir-226"></a>Controls the way
    Ediff presents the default directory when it prompts the user
    for files to compare. If <code>nil</code>, Ediff uses the
    default directory of the current buffer when it prompts the
    user for file names. Otherwise, it will use the directories it
    had previously used for files A, B, or C,
    respectively.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-no-emacs-help-in-control-buffer</code></dt>

    <dd><a name=
    "index-ediff_002dno_002demacs_002dhelp_002din_002dcontrol_002dbuffer-227"
    id=
    "index-ediff_002dno_002demacs_002dhelp_002din_002dcontrol_002dbuffer-227">
    </a>If <code>t</code>, makes <kbd>C-h</kbd> behave like the
    &lt;DEL&gt; key, i.e., it will move you back to the previous
    difference rather than invoking help. This is useful when, in
    an xterm window or a text-only terminal, the Backspace key is
    bound to <kbd>C-h</kbd> and is positioned more conveniently
    than the &lt;DEL&gt; key.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-toggle-read-only-function</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name=
      "index-ediff_002dtoggle_002dread_002donly_002dfunction-228"
      id=
      "index-ediff_002dtoggle_002dread_002donly_002dfunction-228"></a>This
      variable's value is a function that Ediff uses to toggle the
      read-only property in its buffers.

      <p>The default function that Ediff uses simply toggles the
      read-only property, unless the file is under version control.
      For a checked-in file under version control, Ediff first
      tries to check the file out.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-make-buffers-readonly-at-startup
    nil</code></dt>

    <dd><a name=
    "index-ediff_002dmake_002dbuffers_002dreadonly_002dat_002dstartup-229"
    id=
    "index-ediff_002dmake_002dbuffers_002dreadonly_002dat_002dstartup-229">
    </a>If <code>t</code>, all variant buffers are made read-only
    at Ediff startup.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-keep-variants</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name=
      "index-g_t_0040code_007bediff_002dkeep_002dvariants_007d-230"
      id=
      "index-g_t_0040code_007bediff_002dkeep_002dvariants_007d-230">
      </a>The default is <code>t</code>, meaning that the buffers
      being compared or merged will be preserved when Ediff quits.
      Setting this to <code>nil</code> causes Ediff to offer the
      user a chance to delete these buffers (if they are not
      modified). Supplying a prefix argument to the quit command
      (<code>q</code>) temporarily reverses the meaning of this
      variable. This is convenient when the user prefers one of the
      behaviors most of the time, but occasionally needs the other
      behavior.

      <p>However, Ediff temporarily resets this variable to
      <code>t</code> if it is invoked via one of the "buffer" jobs,
      such as <code>ediff-buffers</code>. This is because it is all
      too easy to lose a day's work otherwise. Besides, in a
      "buffer" job, the variant buffers have already been loaded
      prior to starting Ediff, so Ediff just preserves status quo
      here.</p>

      <p>Using <code>ediff-cleanup-hook</code>, one can make Ediff
      delete the variants unconditionally (e.g., by making
      <code>ediff-janitor</code> into one of these
      hooks).<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-keep-tmp-versions</code></dt>

    <dd><a name=
    "index-g_t_0040code_007bediff_002dkeep_002dtmp_002dversions_007d-231"
    id=
    "index-g_t_0040code_007bediff_002dkeep_002dtmp_002dversions_007d-231">
    </a>Default is <code>nil</code>. If <code>t</code>, the
    versions of the files being compared or merged using operations
    such as <code>ediff-revision</code> or
    <code>ediff-merge-revisions</code> are not deleted on exit. The
    normal action is to clean up and delete these version
    files.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>ediff-grab-mouse</code></dt>

    <dd><a name=
    "index-g_t_0040code_007bediff_002dgrab_002dmouse_007d-232" id=
    "index-g_t_0040code_007bediff_002dgrab_002dmouse_007d-232"></a>Default
    is <code>t</code>. Normally, Ediff grabs mouse and puts it in
    its control frame. This is useful since the user can be sure
    that when he needs to type an Ediff command the focus will be
    in an appropriate Ediff's frame. However, some users prefer to
    move the mouse by themselves. The above variable, if set to
    <code>maybe</code>, will prevent Ediff from grabbing the mouse
    in many situations, usually after commands that may take more
    time than usual. In other situation, Ediff will continue
    grabbing the mouse and putting it where it believes is
    appropriate. If the value is <code>nil</code>, then mouse is
    entirely user's responsibility. Try different settings and see
    which one is for you.</dd>
