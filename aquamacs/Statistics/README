I have put together a couple of scripts that pull a log file from the Aquamacs server at Sourceforge and produce some statistics with the help of R.

You will need to have R installed (and available from the path as R), and also two Perl modules (Time::ParseDate and Geo::IP). If that's too much to ask, don't bother installing all of this - just view the PDFs that are already checked in CVS.
