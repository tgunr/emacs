;; Overview:
;;
;; `visual-line-mode' and `global-visual-line-mode' enable
;; navigation by visual lines.  Vertical movement commands such as
;; `next-line' and `previous-line' (normally bound to up/down arrow
;; keys) will move the point to the next line as shown on the
;; screen, even if that is the same line in the underlying buffer.
;; The point is moved to a position that is located (on the screen)
;; horizontally close (pixel-wise), rather than to an equivalent
;; by-character column.
;;

;; Notable changes:

;; Initial version:
;; This file was adapted from Aquamacs Emacs.
;; Lennart Borgmann contributed the code that creates a minor mode
;; for this.

;; Code Comments:

;; Note that `visual-line-up' and friends use two different methods to
;; figure out the best position to move to because of a slowness with
;; outline-(minor-)mode. One of the methods (basically binary search) is
;; much faster when a lot of hidden text is present, but a bit slower in
;; all other cases.

 "Number of lines of margin at top and bottom of a window.
For visual scrolling with up and down keys, this value
applies instead of `scroll-margin' if it is non-nil.

The reason this variable exists is that clicks in the first and last
line of a window will set the cursor within the standard scroll-margin,
causing the buffer to scroll immediately. This is usually undesired.
In this case, set `scroll-margin' to zero and `visual-scroll-margin'
to the desired margin."

With prefix argument, kill that many lines from point.
Negative arguments kill lines backward.
With zero argument, kills the text before point on hthe current line.

When calling from a program, nil means \"no arg\",
a number counts as a prefix arg.

To kill a whole line, when point is not at the beginning, type \
\\[beginning-of-line] \\[kill-line] \\[kill-line].

If `kill-whole-line' is non-nil, then this command kills the whole line
including its terminating newline, when used at the beginning of a line
with no argument.  As a consequence, you can always kill a whole line
by typing \\[beginning-of-line] \\[kill-line].

If you want to append the killed line to the last killed text,
use \\[append-next-kill] before \\[kill-line].

If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting
the line, but put the line in the kill ring anyway.  This means that
you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.
\(If the variable `kill-read-only-ok' is non-nil, then this won't
even beep.)
