;;; Commentary:

;; Derived partly from lisp/prim/simple.el in XEmacs.

;; Emacs' normal undo system allows you to undo an arbitrary
;; number of buffer changes.  These undos are recorded as ordinary
;; buffer changes themselves.  So when you break the chain of
;; undos by issuing some other command, you can then undo all
;; the undos.  The chain of recorded buffer modifications
;; therefore grows without bound, truncated only at garbage
;; collection time.
;;
;; The redo/undo system is different in two ways:
;;   1. The undo/redo command chain is only broken by a buffer
;;      modification.  You can move around the buffer or switch
;;      buffers and still come back and do more undos or redos.
;;   2. The `aquamacs-redo' command rescinds the most recent undo
;;      without recording the change as a _new_ buffer change.  It
;;      completely reverses the effect of the undo, which includes
;;      making the chain of buffer modification records shorter by
;;      one, to counteract the effect of the undo command making the
;;      record list longer by one.
;;   3. `aquamacs-undo' will restore point and mark.
;;

;; Changes:

;; 02/2007:
;; renamed undo -> aquamacs-undo, and redo -> aquamacs-redo
;; so that old undo/redo commands are still available (C-_)
;; restore mark and point
